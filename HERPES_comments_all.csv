If you wish to ask whether personal symptoms might be herpes then be sure to read the Rules for posts about Personal Symptoms.

Thank you, and welcome to the sub.",23,2017-03-22 17:33:44-04:00,"[removed] ### Hi there. I'm wondering if we are still allowed to post photos? I don't see this option when trying to create a post. :) ### [deleted] ### To post photos in the sub you need to first upload them to an image hosting service such as imgur.com and then include the text links to your photos/album in the body of your post. So you basically need to create a regular post (ie a text post) to do that. 

People sometimes get confused because, when attempting to create a new post in this sub, the option to create an ""Image or video"" post is greyed out and not selectable. That's because an ""Image or video"" post is a particular kind of post that  just includes a post title along with a photo or video and nothing else -- no post body or description of any kind. Those kinds of posts are common in porn-type subs such as r/gonewild, or in photography subs like r/earthporn.  We don't allow those here because, without any accompanying description, they aren't helpful. ### ",56,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/60xlxh/be_sure_to_read_the_sub_rules_before_asking_about/
npznfp,"SPFPP 2021 HSV Survey Results Are in Here’s the results of the survey from our community, by our community, for our community: https://www.spfpp.org/2021-hsv-survey-results

Thank you so much!",142,2021-06-01 13:36:45-04:00,"Interesting to know the majority has successful disclosures and had sex with non positive partners ### I loved reading this. Thank you for sharing. I'd love to participate in any future surveys! ### I wonder if anyone who found they have herpes via blood work and got tested again via blood and came back negative. I been reading online that the blood test for HSV can come back with a false positive or even not properly diagnose someone who has it and it’s experiencing symptom ### Good survey, hopefully it'll alleviate alot of the anxiety people have. People tend to go on and lead pretty normal lives ### As someone who was diagnosed days ago this was interesting to read thank you ### What a powerful survey, and the comments at the end are profound. Proud fothe people in this group. I hope this gets shared with the medical community. We talk often of how to ""get word out"" - having worked in two professions who's sole purpose was communication and education, I'd target the medical community directly first and big name folks secondly because the medical profession will eventually hear this and put pressure on the big name folks to broadcast it (even better if we get both to help at same time) - it'll take time and persistence - it's both education and marketing; we educate and market to medical pros. My thoughts this morning. ### This is fantastic. Thank you SO much for taking the time, making the effort and sharing the results. Wow. Not sure if you've done this before as I am new to this forum and haven't had time to explore your website yet, but it's a great start and assessment overall with many good suggestions at the end in the comments section. As a scientist, please LMK if you want/need any help with handling/calculating the data in the future. Although the pie charts seem relatively straightforward and accurate, the bar-charts do not. They are confusing, both in terms of the axis labels related to each bar, missing information/descriptions and the percentages appear to be way off which doesn't make sense. Not sure what happened there but everything should always add up to 100% total. Regardless, this and you are awesome. Thanks again!!! ### this is exciting ### I feel like the answers on here are less accurate especially with the depression and suicide I see people on reddit being so depressed over this also I had a suicide attempt over herpes was in hospital ### [removed] ### Thank you for posting this. I'd love to participate in this year's survey ### Thank you for hosting the survey! ### Hon do you have a kik? ### Nice o ### Nice! ### Can anyone explain to me why I can’t respond to certain individuals comments on certain threads in this group

And could someone explain to me how to even post a post on this page (Sry... New to Reddit)

Also on Mobile ### Hi! I am wondering if anyone takes ongoing medications (antivirals or other) to lower transmission and prevent future outbreaks. ### Is herpes that much more common in women? 

Sorry if that’s a dumb question - I’m new ### Really good work. 
I’m very curious about the differences by gender  though. The majority of respondents are female. 

In my mind I imagine men would respond more favorably to discolosure than females, but this may be complete bias on my part.

Would it be possible to see how the different genders fared in having relationships after diagnosis? ### It's crazy that there is people who tested positive with blood test and just let that be it. When it could be possible that they don't have it at all ### This was really helpful but I would have also liked to see the breakdown between the experiences of a Man interested in women, a Women interested in Men, Men interested in Men, Women interested in Women, Etc etc in regards to how the others responded to their diagnosis when told, how dating has been, have they been able to date regular people, how many of the non hsv people accepted them and moved forward with sex, dating, relationship, etc etc, has any of them performed oral on you or have you to them, did either catch anything, where their mind is in regards to their diagnosis, did it change the way they see life, did it bring any positive aspects into their life (Example: Maturity), to them how do they view HSV in relation to how the world functions, have they come to terms with it, do they now understand why people before them or the person that gave it to them didn’t tell them, did their Highschool teach STD’s the right way, by giving them the actual statistics and clear descriptive details of all details pertaining to it, do they feel the medical industry and colleges are teaching it wrong, did anyone’s symptoms get worse after getting the vaccine, did they disclose their diagnosis to anyone and if so who, how many people know, if they kept it private, is it because they are private people, they didn’t want it getting out that they had it, is that also the reason why they may not have disclosed their diagnosis to future partners, are they on a Lysine Diet, if so, what do they eat, have they noticed any increased irritability with the foods they have eatin, have any of them come a crossed foods that they noticed are directly associated with triggering symptoms, if so what foods, 

And have any of them realized that between doctors only allowing a test for it if symptoms are present, 75% of people not showing symptoms, so more than not don’t know they have it, condoms don’t protect you from it and that everyone whether they were taught right about it or not is risking catching HSV

So with all that being said HSV doesn’t put you in a Black or White Situation but that from a Moral Aspect it places you in Limbo


Edit - Has anyone heard of The dating app called positivesingles.com and if so have they joined, (if you don’t want to download the app cause you’re afraid a friend or family member may see it who doesn’t know your diagnosis - You can still use and access the App just by going to the Site instead of downloading the App - which is nice because that’s what I do) ### Were respondents allowed to answer more than once? Wanted to check for accuracy ### hey OP, I can't see the results :( i wonder if its not working anymore. ### Hi! I’m seeing that people are having trouble accessing the link to the survey. I’ve tried all I know to do in order to fix it and it ONLY works when you click the link, and when it offers you to “reload” you just have to avoid that and click outside that box to show the results from a mobile device. I’m working on the survey for this year and with a survey service that costs money I hope. ### For some reason the link in the pinned post isn’t working :( ### For causes of OBs, what is an example of physical stress on the body? ### Also alarming how many people don’t disclose at all. ### I know right. We’d never know if people hadn’t felt safe sharing. ### Yea but the Breakdown of the Percentages showing whether they were a Male or Female would have helped a ton, as well as if their partner or the person they disclosed it to that accepted it was Male or Female, the numbers of times they disclosed it as well as the number of times that people turned them down because of it would have also been very helpful as well ### FWIW: My son tested “slightly positive” for HSV when he had double mono (he definitely had both EBV and CMV, and elevated levels of EVERYTHING).  After he finally recovered from the mono, he got retested for HSV and it was a strong negative. ### I’m in this boat right now. I’m pretty sure I have it because I had a horrible outbreak but the test was weird and inconclusive. Wasn’t done by my primary care ### Seems like the people on here are satisfied with what could be a false positive ### I wasn’t properly diagnosed until two years after my first outbreak because my tests were false negatives. Legit had swabs and blood work. Both were negative. Same thing on the second outbreak. It wasn’t until the third one where I finally received a positive result. 

Every outbreak, the doc was always convinced it was herpes. ### Of course! ### Thank you for that. I’m going to share my template for the email I send to the website spfpp.org for people if they want to harass therapists and clinics as well! Yayuhhh. ### Hey there! Thank you!!! The information is lengthy so if you’re at a mobile device you won’t see it fully. Try looking from a desktop. 

I believe the 100% comment is in reference to the check all that apply questions and the “other” responses so those only show what percent of people selected the options, so those won’t add up to 100%. ### I have you all to thank for supporting this effort. ### So take this into consideration…. People who NEED support, seek support, get a little help, get to a little bit better of a place. My podcast audience primarily consisted of those people. I tapped into my networks and asked that people share the survey with people they know, so I THINK that outside that range of people, those who didn’t know about these resources were more likely struggling. I looked at the analytics and not many people from Reddit came to the site to have taken the quiz. Most was from my podcast, insta following and then the ransoms would’ve been from me harassing people to tell their friends. Make sense?

On the site spfpp.org, there is one survey I’ve done that is FAR MORE reflective of what you’re saying. It’s from 2019 though. 98% of people said they were depressed (not diagnosed with depression) 6% attempted suicide and 48% of people had suicide ideation after diagnosis. So you’re right about the difference in data. ### Yes!!! I hope the admins let me share it here again! We had a great response to it. ### Thank you for taking it. ### Nope. Just insta Honmychest ### I do ### Hey no dumb question…. Men just didn’t take the survey. My hypothesis is avoidance. ### Great question. I think more women are willing to take the survey, be vulnerable and seek support for navigating emotions, whereas men are more closed off emotionally (traditionally I mean). So it isn’t that not many men get herpes, know they have herpes, or don’t listen to this podcast, it’s that they’re uncomfortable with emotions or to them it just genuinely isn’t on their list of priorities to explore in the stigma space. ### What’s crazy is that there are people who haven’t been tested at all who have it. ### I appreciate this input. I’m pursuing funding to do more in depth research (pray for me lol) and this is great info to take into my data collection!!! Keep in contact please. I do little data collection on my insta @honmychest like this often. ### Honestly think the way the medical world is handling herpes is perpetuating the stigma extremely ### I mean they could but would have to sign in under different email addresses. And idk if anyone was THAT invested as this was pretty lengthy. ### It must be time for a new one! Yayuhhhh. I have screenshots on my Instagram @honmychest and talk about them on the podcasts. I’ll get started on one for 2022. I’m wondering if Google forms just expire after several months. ### The link takes you to the website landing page for it. If this isn’t working for ya try going to the site directly: www.spfpp.org then click the “2021 HSV survey” tab. ### Stuff that normally makes you sick. Low sleep, general fatigue, aching, overdoing it, etc. ### Thanks for doing this :) ### 100%. Most of the success stories come from women. And from what I gather in forums and experience, as a man, unless you're looking for ""the one"" and are fine sifting through, dating seems to become a lot lot harder.... ### Interesting ### Wait how often were you getting tested in that period? ### Hey man. Ahhh Gotchya. That explains it. In that case you could do it based on the number of items checked instead of number of peeps. Multiple choice does skew it in relation to the latter but now I understand the numbers better. So each number (not percentage) reflects the actual number of times each was selected correct? In which case each one becomes it’s own 100% scale more or less. I see. 

BTW I Couldn’t  see everything even on my desktop (the display of the bar graphs are shifted, cutoff which sometimes happens depending). Thanks again!! ### Cool ### Hi I wonder if that is safe? Did the doctor prescribe it? And do you or did you have recurrent OBs? ### Thanks for your understanding! That makes more sense - I didn’t think the ratio was THAT different ### Many don't get tested either.  Using the whole ""I didn't know"" or ""I don't have that"" because they've never been tested or have an actual diagnosis. Avoidance & ignorance. Although I've seen this true for women as well... ### Agreed. But as a man I’m curious if men get the same majority positive response to disclosing. Most stories we read and hear are from the perspective of women. I imagine partly men are less likely to seek out a diagnosis and be in the position in the first place… ### Will do and will try! Have 3 Reddit accounts and often forget about this one… but will do the best I can to stay in contact, and just checked out your IG and did enjoy what I saw, and even saved some posts, however I will not follow only because not a single family member or friend knows I have this and I would like to keep it that way, but I will most definitely support from a distance ### That’s super fair, just wondering because I was hoping to use this data in an article I’m writing ### Thanks ### It’s especially interesting, since almost everyone who has EBV/CMV has HSV1, but he doesn’t. I wonder if he’s immune, or if contracting it at his age might be dangerous?  His dad has HSV1(O), and I have HSV2(G), so I’m hoping he’s immune. (Lordy, he’s had enough trouble just with EBV and CMV!) ### Hover your cursor over the wording/graph to see the full answer. If that isn’t working I’m gonna have to figure something else out. Thanks for letting me know. ### I was having a breakout that lasted me 3 weeks it would start to clear and come back so dr told me to keep taking them and i haven't had a breakout since 🤞🏽 ### I think it highlights that men either aren’t seeking the information, unwilling to participate, or just don’t need it. ### Unfortunately, in hetero relationships, many women have to take the lead AND follow through on not giving up the goods til men test their woods. No test no sex. I hate that this is the only way to get men to go get tested as this is just one more thing that falls onto women’s responsibility, but it’s the only temporary fix I have at the moment based on convos I’ve had about how many men women with herpes disclose to but haven’t been tested recently or at all. ### This is only a hypothesis based on the podcast interviews with so many women, but I’m finding that many women diagnosed with herpes in hetero relationships were not disclosed to by their partners. About 1/3 to 2/3 of my podcast guests found out later that their male partner just didn’t disclose to them. ### You won’t follow a sex positive mental health account on social media because you think a family member will find out you have herpes? ### Ooh I’m happy to connect if you wanna discuss further. ### Of course ### Right on. I’ll give it a try. ### I couldn't see the full answers, results either.  I was curious about the data but could only see overall chart. Not individual questions, responses, or sections of data. 

Thank you for doing this! It was a helpful read, and surveys like this are so important for future research as well as navigating the experience personally. ### How long since you had the last OB and what antivirals and dosage do you take please? ### If I only knew all of this before… ### Yea 😕 ### Would love that! I’ll DM you ### Hey there. You weren’t able to see any of those things? Are you on a mobile device? I’ll need to figure out something for the next one if that’s the case. ### 9 months 500 mg a day if theres an outbreak dr said to take 1000 a day for a week then back to 500 ### We’re working to get people to know this sooner, I promise. ### I get it. ###   Yes I'm on mobile! So that may be why. I don't have access to a desktop to look otherwise.
  It was mostly the responses and what each group of the graphs stood for that I could only see first couple words (trying to click on item didn't expand it an any way). So yes I was unable to see/ interpret some of the graphs based on only the first word or 2 labeling each group.  And I could not see responses ppl chose in the same way (just first word).  Idk if others are experiencing the same.  But yeah I couldn't get the details to be able to properly interpret the wealth of information and just wanted you to know about it! ### What about those that didn’t know and that are in this permanent issue now? So what about us? ### Ahh ok. You’ll see the whole thing from a laptop/non-mobile version. Thanks for letting me know. ### Could you rephrase the question so I can answer it clearly for ya please? ### You said that you’re working to get people to know sooner which means that people need to know that they must get tested and be careful to not catch this virus right? So what about those who have it? What is going to be done for them? Millions of people left in agony and stress with maybe difficulties in meeting someone to have a family with. People with no help from no ministry of health, what about them? So who will help us? ### Oh nooo sorry that was interpreted. I mean for people to be more informed about just how seemingly inevitable exposure is. For people to become educated and most prepared for being diagnosed or disclosed to. People need options to navigate stigma. More people living with herpes are “okay” than aren’t. So this resource serves AS the thing to help those most struggling with the internalized agony of their diagnosis from an emotional and mental health perspective. There’s work being done by people with more resources than I have access to in order to treat physical symptoms. I do what I can in regards to stigma. That’s the best I got for us. ### I understand. ### I need to understand if this is a serious virus because doctors don’t seam to want to answer to this question when I ask them…with serious I mean also dangerous ### ",163,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/npznfp/spfpp_2021_hsv_survey_results_are_in/
tmftit,"came to the conclusion Hello I’m a 17yo F, caught herpes losing my virginity and honestly it sucked. Orr what I think is herpes can’t know for sure but at the same time I don’t really care. So what if people stigmatized this disease I realized if someone really loved you they will take all your good and bad:) oh well I get a few pimples down there whatever! I’m not saying it’s a great thing to have but that’s life! Lmao, things happen and there’s always consequences. I used to hate myself, regret every decision that got me to there I hated my life thought it was over. But the crazy thing is it’s just beginning. I see people come to this forum everyday scared for their life asking “is this herpes” you’re not going to die. Take a breathe, and don’t be like me go to get tested right away! Don’t be embarrassed or shy. Honestly just don’t like disclosing😭 I don’t feel like I can. But at the same time I don’t want to, not because I want to spread it or anything but in the sense that catching herpes was really a wake up call for me. Stopped doing all the bad really focused on school and gym and work and I’m really living life without men. Self love is what I can tell you to do and be confident in yourself. After finding out u had it I really felt dirty and hated myself. But it literally just felt like eczema lol so I told myself to stfu and get over myself and my own internal stigma. Sending love your way if you’re dealing with this. If anyone wants to talk just comment:)",12,2022-03-24 11:05:19-04:00,"Same 31F GHSV1 first outbreak last month and honestly i just shifted my mindset for the better. My life isn’t over it’s just beginning to be different in what i focus on! I’m cheering you on! You make me proud girl! ### This is a great mentality! Disclosing will be easier with time ! ### It's impressive to seem a young person take it in the most mature way posible.  It happened for a reason , people weren't careful enough. So we may as well embrace the fact it was a mistake and try to live with it because like u said.  It won't kill you and when the time come someone who'll truly love you will not care you've herpes and still accept you the way you're.  💯 ### Get tested Maybe you don’t have it you can’t self diagnose it’s very tricky it happened to me kept tripping for a month and was so “Sure” did a test came back negative but it surely still had an effect on me and I will keep supporting this community forever❤️ ### I really needed to hear this. I was diagnosed end of last month and I’ve been super depressed and hating myself. I absolutely love your outlook on all of this. Thank you for sharing ❤️ ### Thank you guys for all your messages. I would like to say to the people who have commented and messaged me. Really the only thing I couldn’t wrap my head around is I know people will 20+ bodies but I had the luck of catching hsv my first time dang. Life is life🤷🏽‍♀️ ### F/19 Literally same situation. Caught it when I was 17 after my first time. Glad too see you pull through so fast :) It took months of lying in bed being depressed and suicidal for me, but now I don't even think about it anymore and doesn't affect my life really, there's real problems to worry about. And yeah, people do make it seem like a bigger deal than it really is. ### Exactly. Life is life things happen for a reason ### RIGHT! Even if it is negative ima still be up in this groups comments and supporting everyone. I’m kinda too scared to check I’ve developed a mentality now and honestly don’t know what to do if it did come negative but I do have an appointment for a blood test next week:) wish me luck! ### You’re going to be okay. Sending love your way! ### I’m in the beginning stages of that I hope I can get where you’re at mentally ### I wish you the best and hope everything will turn out good for you and with your mentality nothing can phase you Keep it UP👍 ### ",19,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tmftit/came_to_the_conclusion/
tn9ixp,I’m stuck with a terrible person because he gave me herpes 😭 I don’t want to be alone… I can’t even afford to be alone yet I’m beyond depressed and barely work anymore but I’m so young I’m not comfortable telling anyone else I have HSV… and don’t think I ever will be…I’m trapped in this relationship and it’s hell,10,2022-03-24 20:17:29-04:00,"You're not stuck. I used to think if I ever found someone who would date me regardless of my status, that would have to be my one. But no, your mental health is just as important. Don't think you can't date around and be happy elsewhere. They know the risks before entering a relationship with you. If it doesn't work out it just doesn't. 🤷🏾‍♀️ I understand the financial part but when you get back into the groove, please start to build yourself up again and get out. Do what you have to do to get away because the longer you stay the worse it gets. ### I’m 11yrs HSV+. As I often say here, the vast majority will accept your diagnosis as a minor flaw if you’re open and confident about it.

I disclosed to my current GF only a few weeks ago. “I have an STI. It’s a minor skin condition. I take meds to protect you but if we have sex once a week, in 26yrs you’d likely get it.” She said she’d have to breakup with me in 25yrs, lol.

Leave the BF if he’s terrible. Solo is better than terrible and other men will desire you. ### You’re not stuck. You’re choosing to stay. Leave. And learn to disclose and move on with your life. It’s not a big deal. Don’t let fear rule your decisions. ### How old are you? ### ~40M ### I’m only in my 20’s people don’t seem so accepting 😭 ### Think of it like a filter, if they’re not accepting, they’re not meant to be with you. I disclosed to someone and he still didn’t want to use protection. There are definitely people out there who definitely will not care or will see past it. ### I’m also in my 20s. I know it’s nerve wracking telling people, but a lot of it is just stigma. I’ve had it for less than a year & have disclosed to a handful of people. It hasn’t steered anyone away yet. Please do not feel like this is the end of the world. There is someone out there that will be accepting of you & won’t be terrible. ### I seem to have lost a platonic friend over it, she freaked out because we shared drinks and I didn't even get a confirmed positive swab ### She sounds like a shitty friend, and the trash took itself out. ### ",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tn9ixp/im_stuck_with_a_terrible_person_because_he_gave/

tmel6s,"I told my best friend and completely regret it I (22f) have been best friends with this girl since jr.high. We've been through a lot together, death, being on our own at a young age, ECT. When I got ghsv1 about 3 months ago I was hesitant to tell anyone but I felt like I was dying. So I finally did tell her and she told her boyfriend (who I fucking hate). He said he has oral hsv1 and got it from a water fountain, which we all know is impossible. Now everytime we go out and I even show the smallest interest in someone they hound me about tell the person about my diagnosis. Like I've known this person for probably an hour and they want me to tell them. They shame me for not wanting to (because I don't even know them yet) and make me feel dirty. Last time I walked away crying my eyes out. I'm doing really well handling it otherwise, hsv hasn't affected me that much in all honesty. But the way they make me feel about it.... I don't even want to talk to her after a decade of friendship now.",27,2022-03-24 10:42:12-04:00,"And that’s completely fair to not want to talk to them after that. If she told her boyfriend who she knows that you hate without your permission then that’s a violation of trust and shouldn’t be taken lightly. Also, that’s ridiculous that your so called “friends” would put that type of pressure on you when you go out. You disclose whenever you feel it’s appropriate. You clearly know way more about Hsv than them considering her boyfriend thinks he got it from a water fountain 😂 … but seriously, it sounds like you need to let this girl go or explain to her how hurtful her actions are. ### what jerks. are you fucking them then and there in public?? then they should keep their mouths closed. im sorry youre being treated that way. people are treating me differently too, but if someone ever told me how to handle my disease (while being misinformed at that), i'd have some strong words for em. gHSV1 isnt even that big of a deal, transmission/shedding wise. your friend would have contracted it if her man was any good in bed. LOL ### I stopped talking to my best friend over her alcoholic boyfriend at that age. She actually stopped talking to me as I was definitely fine with her as a person, just sick of cleaning up her boyfriends puke...

Anyway, 12 years later and we are happily living together ^_^ perhaps ya'll need a break, herpes issue or not? ### First of all it’s YOUR decision when to disclose. Not anyone else’s. I would talk to her separately and bring up the fact that your told her this in confidence (why the fuck did she tell her man) and that it’s not on their part to pressure you in telling the whole world. If she fights back in any way tbh it’s not worth arguing. A true friend would respect the boundary placed ### You are well within your right to not to tell anyone you dont feel comfortable knowing. ### This is exactly why I have never told a single soul friend/family wise. If they get mad at you or something they always have it to use against you. ### That’s no longer your friend ### What the actual fuck? Why did she fee the need to tell her bf? Not cool, first of all. Secondly, sounds like they have some stigma around STIs to unlearn. Did bf disclose to every person he ever kissed on the lips/cheek/gave oral to? Doubt it. ### This is NOT a friend! Cut her off! Last August before I moved out of state I told my best friend of 10 years about my hsv2. We were watching suicide squad we were alone in the theater and as soon as the movie got done (we had been drinking) I looked over at her and came out about it. She didnt judge me at all. I had been wanting to tell her for years. I'm sorry you're going though this but you deserve better friends. ### Tell them how you feel and if they still keep up the toxic behavior, you don’t need people like that in your life. Sorry you’re going through that, you deserve better ### Ew these sound like awful people. You should have friends that lift you up and make you feel good and ok. All my friends have been 100% supportive and reassure me how insignificant this is. You should cut them off or talk to them ### Sounds like she is not a great friend. Unfortunately it's through these experiences that we learn who we can and cannot trust. Take it as a lesson learnt but don't let it make you jaded about trusting people. If you value this person, maybe consider talking to her about how this has made you feel. If she's a decent person and worth having in your life she will apologise and you can try to both move forward from this. If she doesn't respect what you have to say and how you feel, she was not worth keeping as a best friend. People come and go in our lives, just because you were good for each other then does not mean you'll be good for each other for the future. Sorry you have had to go through this. It gets better ### The thing is if this person is a special as you say she is and you don’t wasn’t to completely loose her then it’s ok to creat some distance between the two of you . Also maybe not give them the scoop when you’re interested in someone if that’s how they react. Tell that person when your good and ready and comfortable to do so. Don’t let them pressure you into doing something your not ready to . ### Just going to throw this out there bc I haven’t seen this yet posted, but does your friend know she runs the risk of contracting hsv from her bf? Regardless of hsv type, it presents itself both orally and genitally. He can pass it to her genitally by performing oral sex. 

Seems like your friend and her bf aren’t educated on hsv. The stigma surrounding hsv is just sad. I recommend telling them that they should do more research on hsv and they will learn a lot, including that sti screening is not done for herpes. In fact, per CDC website, “There is no evidence that diagnosing genital herpes with a blood test in someone without symptoms would change their sexual behavior and stop the virus from spreading. In addition, without knowing the benefits of testing, the risk of shaming and stigmatizing people outweighs the potential benefits.”  A lot of people have it and don’t know it. The stigma surrounding herpes should be changed. ### I've been thinking about it. Ever since they got together our relationship has been strained. It's just she was there for me when my boyfriend died and when I was living on my own at 16 and I was there when her parents died. It just seems like a shame to throw that away ### I know it was really frustrating to have them shame me when they don't even know what they're talking about. This is MY virus and I spent months researching everything about it. I'm a science student, I know how to inform myself on something. ""Ok but you should still tell them, I'd want to know"" ok... He has oral herpes (apparently) I've never seen him tell anyone once before sharing a drink or food with someone? But because mine is down south I'm a terrible person? ### Lmao. Good observation 🤣 ### That's something I've considered. I had already started distancing myself after they got serious. Maybe I'll just keep doing it until/if they break up. And I'm happy for you two! I'm glad you're together again ❤️ ### Yeah I've basically asked her to never bring it up again. Even if it's just me and her. I told her I wish I'd never told her anything, which I think hurt her feelings. And I kind of hope it did. If she continues I think I'll have to cut it off. As much as I don't want to. ### Yeah I thought the same thing. He share drinks and cigarettes with people he doesn't even know all the time. It's only because mine is down south that I'm ""different"" ITS THE SAME THING ### I understand completely but sometimes we have to let go of people who no longer have our best interests. I have multiple childhood friends that I’ve completely cut contact with because I realized they were no longer healthy for me at this point in my life and it sounds like your friend is very immature and does not care about your emotional well-being. Nobody that cares about you would treat you like that. It’s immature and super disrespectful. ### I’ve been having issues with my best friend lately. Honestly, if you have issues, just create some distance and only see them once in a while. That’s what I’ve been doing. I know eventually we will be on the same page again. No use in throwing it away, but taking some space is important. ### Some friendships last like this... I also let go of a BFF at 22 (since kindergarten) and tried to rekindle it but nope. So... It's ok. You'll end up with more friends than you ever imagined by the time you're 30. ### Yeah i mean you confided in her and she broke that trust. If she is butthurt about it then let her be. Just remember you’re not in the wrong for placing that boundary with her. Fortunately having HSV weeds out people that don’t have our best interest at heart. ### Sometimes the reality of it all is just difficult. I appreciate you being straightforward and realistic about it. ### You hit the nail right on the head with that one. A little over a year ago I cut one of my best friends off who I have been friends with since childhood. We are both 34 and have been friends with each other since we were 5. It was over the capital riots and I posted something about it and she was basically like ""if this is how you feel I don't want to be your friend anymore"" my mom called her out and she deleted my mom. I deleted her off my fb and havent talked to her since. I broke my ankle the next day so I'm not sure if that was karma or not but regardless I don't really want to be friends with someone like that anyway. I also cut 2 other childhood friends off back in 2015 because one was being a complete asshole to me when my family moved to Arizona and left me to be a single mom on my own. They were my support system with my son and I was struggling with his behavior and having no help. She basically told me to suck it up instead of being understanding and supportive. Cut another one off for being a straight up insane person when it came to political stuff. We obviously don't agree and she's not one of those people who can agree to disagree, she always wanted to be right. ### Thank you I really appreciate your perspective it's helped more than you know ### ",13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tmel6s/i_told_my_best_friend_and_completely_regret_it/

tn7029,"IGG Questions after exposure Hi All, hope some of you can help me.  I had protected oral and vaginal sex with a prostitute 2/27.  I also of course like a dummy was kissing this person just so you know the background.  I think I saw something on her lip as well.  I believe a couple days after I got the same looking thing on my lip.  Nothing aggressive looking but a spot on the lip nonetheless.

Just FYI I have had HSV1 since I was very young (so im assuming its Oral).  I was never diagnosed with a swab or anything though.  A couple days after the incident above I was just not feeling myself (extreme fatigue, kind of fog like thinking, blurry vision etc, and I think I also got sick).  The tip of my dick has also been sore on and off since as well.  Also I got a shot of Rocephin on 3/2 and my doc gave me Azithromycin 2000 mg one dose on 3/4 just to be safe.

I was tested for all STDs on 3/2, 3 days after exposure (just positive with HSV1 IGG at 30.80).  Tested 3/16 (tested positive with HSV1 IGG at 30.80 again).  Tested 3/23 and now positive with HSV1 but my HSV1 went up to 32.80.   I just got the results.

I guess my question for all you experts here, are 

1, is 24 days post exposure truly too early to have a decently accurate result for HSV2.

2, The fact that I got the same looking thing on my lip, my worry is she had OHSV2 and transferred it to me thru kissing.  I know its rare, but if she went down on a guy before me with GHSV2, transferred it to her mouth and then kissed me, its possible right?  

3, is the fact my results were 30.80, 30.80, and now 32.80 for HSV1 have any indication on a new HSV2 infection or are they completely unrelated?  

Thanks guys.  Love u all and appreciate your support and answers.",4,2022-03-24 18:13:34-04:00,"u/ooohfuck would love any input from you on this. ### If something pops up on lip or else where get it swabbed. 24 days could be to soon for enough antibodies to have developed for new hsv2 infection. Get tested at 12 weeks unless you have an OB ( then get it swabbed ) 

Your hsv1 results going up is not related to a new hsv2 infection. They are separate strains , though some people do test low positive for hsv2 due to 1 , i believe it is called cross reactivity due to igg limitations .  

And the ohsv2 is uncommon , & i’m not sure what you meant by she was exposed & transferred it  ? Do you mean she has it or she was carrying the virus on her lips / mouth from just having sex? ### ok yeah i didnt know if the slight uptick in the HSV1 from the most recent test maybe had something to do with a new HSV2 infection.  

I meant by if she sucked some dudes dick before me with GHSV2 on it, or even kissed him with OHSV2, then contracted OHSV2, maybe thats what was on her lip when I kissed her I guess.... ### She may or may not have ohsv2 , if she has a blister / sore on her lip then it wouldn’t be something she had just acquired, there is incubation periods . Chances are she didn’t have ohsv2 .  But to note that condoms do cut the risk of hsv but do not eliminate it completely as they don’t cover the whole genital area. ### ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tn7029/igg_questions_after_exposure/

tnav2d,"Partner was diagnosed with HSV2 I met a wonderful woman who I’d like to pursue a relationship with. When we met we had sex (used condoms) and we decided before we met up again we would both get tested for STIs so we could enjoy each other without the feel of latex. She came back positive for HSV2. 

I talked to my doctor about. Said if that was the only thing holding me back from seeing her it’s not a good enough reason. Especially if she’s taking medication. 

I agreed that I would see her again to see where things go. I requested she start taking medication which she had no problem with. 

I’m a little nervous about potentially catching HSV2. I already have HSV1. (I disclosed this to her) It just seems so nonchalant to have oral herpes but if you have genital herpes people act like it’s the end of the world. 

Also, statistically you’re less likely to catch herpes from a partner who manages their symptoms and is aware of there status over casual sex partners who may not know, or even mention anything about having herpes. 

If an average of 1 in 6 people has HSV2, divide my body count by 6, I’ve probably had sex with 10 women who have HSV2. And this is only the second woman to disclose this to me. 

Seems like I’m really anxious about nothing. Has anyone been in a similar situation? Did you rely on only medication for prevention of transmission? Or did you use condoms? Both? Did you regret it?

tmuvar,"How to talk about false positives? Hey all.

I wanted to ask about something that I haven’t really seen discussed, both on this subreddit and on the internet, generally.

Some personal history: last year, I underwent STD testing for the first time and received a surprise low positive of 1.47. A follow-up test came back with a second low positive of 1.51. I followed up with a Western Blot…which came back indeterminate (yay). I’ve never had an outbreak and have had an exclusive partner for 7 years (who has consistently tested negative).

Recently, I decided I wanted answers and got in touch with Terri, who offered to help me redo the Western Blot. As I suspected and as available resources have led me to believe, Terri’s opinion was that protein(s) in my blood have triggered false positives. With that said, she also told me that people who receive false positives (and/or indeterminate WB results) will typically *continue* to receive false positives simply due to their body chemistry.

*Given this, I’m curious if anyone here has experience or advice regarding explaining false positives to partners. Do I mention it? If they ask about my STD status, do I disclose? Do I ask for an STD panel that excludes HSV-2? Questions, questions.*

It’s a tough spot since there’s such a stigma and lack of general understanding regarding testing, results, hell, even the condition itself. I appreciate whatever input the community might have.",6,2022-03-24 14:43:23-04:00,"Why did you think you had it? ### I think you've done more than enough. You shouldn't worry about it unless you have actual symptoms at this point.

If you've been with your partner for 7 years & he's tested negative, I'd say you're in the clear. ### I didn’t. My GP included it as part of a routine annual physical. ### Thanks for the reply.

We’re in the process of opening the relationship so there’s definitely potential for new partners. Do you have an opinion on whether disclosing is needed and/or, if we swap results, addressing the low positive? ### Tricky , if you omit your results then will you know theirs ?  Opening yourself up to not knowing if you are at risk from new partner . ### Yea, exactly…feels like an impossible situation.

That’s why I’m curious if anyone has experience having to explain recurring false positives. I’m hoping the second WB will give me a definitive answer but Terri said she thinks it’ll come back indeterminate again. Which, per the University of Washington, counts as a negative.

They preaches abstinence in its place using scare tactics to frighten people to not have sex then the HIV/AIDS epidemic happened furthering the fear of STDs and STIs as a whole. 

How we can end it is by educating others in our lives not just partners but friends and family as well. Another way to combat it is to stop treating it as if it’s a huge embarrassing secret and being more open with your diagnosis if every person who had a form of herpes was public honest and open we outnumber those who do not have it. I understand that not everyone is in that comfortable place in life with their diagnosis but until we get there the stigma will always exist. 

If you are not comfortable being open one thing you can do is anytime you hear someone using stigma language or making a herpes joke is to politely correct him without outing yourself.

I am okay with the information that I've gotten about how to take care of myself to prevent outbreaks and I really don't think it should be as stigmatized as it is.

I'd really appreciate it, thank you so much.",2,2022-03-24 07:56:36-04:00,"I can share my experience a little bit to possibly ease your concerns. I was diagnosed 3 years ago after my ex cheated on me. I was devastated and did like you said, did what I could to prevent outbreaks and at this point it's no different from pimples imo, so yes the stigma is a little silly.

In terms of dating, think of it like a magnet! It'll definitely push away a lot of people, but it will also pull the ones with a deep attraction towards you. In my own experience, yes, I did experience a lot of negative comments, neutral and positive comments in dating. For me it was probably the majority of people. Buuuut, do you think you could even be in a happy relationship long term with a majority of people? absolutely not! So who cares if the people who wouldn't have been that great anyway latch onto it. In my experience, if they're someone who's completely turned away by hsv immediately, then if it wasn't hsv, they would've found some other thing to latch on to.

I met my current girlfriend 1.5 years ago and after a while of talking, I felt it was necessary to inform her. She was pretty much just like, ""oh ok, that's whatever, I still like you for you"". She asked a couple of question out of curiosity, but at no point showed any judgment and was just more excited to be with me. Moral of the story, someone who isn't accepting of your hsv diagnosis when you tell them is a great way to see the good in someone. You'll find the people who don't look at you in disgust, but continue to see you exactly the same are the people you want to keep around. Hsv is but an incredibly small segment of our life, there's still a whole universe of thought and life behind that diagnosis, so seriously, don't let others make you feel as if hsv is who you are. Those who do that are unaware is all. ### It could be a double-edged sword, it can attract the most positive or the most negative people to you. It is necessary to be advanced as an individual both mentally and spiritually, in order to discern who is right for you. You have to develop the ability to read into people,  the patience, let them reveal who they are before becoming intimate. Allow time, in order to get what you desire in due time.

Other than that there is great hope through becoming the best person, I discern learning from myself and others that herpes can be controlled or even made dormant and there are advances in science research. ### ",6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tm48wt/anxiety_a_year_later/

tmabkt,"First time swingers who caught herpes My husband (37m)and I (36f)are both happily married and have been together for 18 years. 
We've been monogamous to one another besides the consensual 3 some on 1 occasion, several several years prior to this event.

We just recently joined the swingers lifestyle; having been acquainted with only female hookups,  we ventured into swapping with other couples.  
We did go into this lifestyle again with a preconceived understanding that we could ""vet"" our couples on how trustworthy their word was when we asked how ""clean"" they've been. Very naive of us. 

We had our first full swap, again without hard evidence of ""clear"" STI panel on Feb 6th.  We met up with them again on Feb 25th again for another full swap. ( all unprotected )

We met another couple and had a full swap, unprotected, on March 6th, 1 week after our last encounter.  Fast forward 5 days later my husband has his first initial GHSV OB. The female half of our last encounter then has a visible OHSV outbreak a couple days later, and after questioning she's had ""cold sores"" for awhile.

My question to you guys, through the countless hours of reading testimonials on here.  How likely is it that my husband picked this up from couple 2 than couple 1.  The time frame from last potential exposure to initial outbreak was 5 days. Can someone with OHSV be contagious a week prior to their own OB and not on daily anti virals?

 I'm not here for anyone's judgment to be casted on us on our lifestyle and we should've known better, I'm here to get opinions and insights from people who have lived through this and are living through this.

I do know the stereotypical statement of it can lay dormant, but it's too coincidental, from us having unprotected sex to the female having cold sores to have come from a dormant virus.

Someone give us some insight please. 

FYI we have proceeded to stop our swinger profile completely and step away from the lifestyle.  This is not something we wish to give by means to anyone else and now a decision we both will live with together.",10,2022-03-24 09:32:38-04:00,"Hi, not here to cast judgement but it is very possible to have got it from the person with cold sores. Actually seems that way, the evidence is there.

Also, for reference as this group is for educating one another m compelled to give some advice. never trust another couple in the lifestyle, no matter what. The first rule is to see paperwork beforehand. Most couples in the lifestyle go in knowing the risk and most will not cough up the extra money for a 10 panel, so that won't prove hsv/HPV/hepatitis status. . Second rule is never unprotected. Couples can engage in high risk behavior and are not obligated to tell other couples every detail of their adventures. 

Again, this is not casting judgement, more power to you, but for other couples interested in swinging- know the risks ### Sounds like he picked it up from the female that had the OHSV outbreak. Oral herpes from what I understand sheds more frequently than genital herpes, and if she’s symptomatic then it’s likely where it came from. 
I’ll note I was in the lifestyle for about 6 years and never contracted anything. I felt the people in the LS community were the most responsible when it came to sexual health. I ended up getting it almost a year ago from someone who never got tested! I definitely think the people who never test are the ones who spread it more. Sorry that happened to you guys. If it does turn out that it’s GHSV1 there’s hope that because it’s known to cause less frequent outbreaks & shedding (not always the case) but you may not have another or less OB’s. Get it tested to find out. ### Yes it’s unfortunate we live in a world where sex isn’t as simple as just don’t get prego. But I think that the HSV could of been contracted either meet. From the first with protection to the second time with no protection. You have no idea if they were shedding skin. But either way it’s permanent for the time being and it’s time for you both to learn from your mistakes and adapt to it. ### I’ll be honest … I got GHSV2 doing something sexually immoral. Idc what ur beliefs are but I’ll tell u right now I would take this as a sign to stop what ur doing and re evaluate the path your on. Please don’t take this as judgement bc it’s not I’ve done a lot of bad things… I’m just telling u sometimes these things happen to make u stop in ur tracks ### Yes I appreciate the feedback. 

Great disclaimer for people who are tempted by the lifestyle and completely unaware that normal STI screenings do not include an HSV panel unless requested by the patient specifically or presenting with visual signs of an apparent OB. ### Thanks for the insight, we just found out today it is HSV2 ### I appreciate the sentiment, but honestly the wording in which you use ""learn from your mistakes"" is quite disturbing.  Like I said, we were naive and maybe even ignorant, but there is nothing to ""learn"",  we have it, period. It doesn't change our relationship and we are still completely happy with one another. This is a very manageable diagnosis and after the initial shock and societies pre conceived notions and stigmas on it, it's not a death sentence to either of us.   

Do you have GHSV or OHSV? ### Nothing's stopping you guys from continuing. Once your husband gets tested and familiar with all the symptoms and takes precautions this can be a good conversation starter.  Won't make anyone feel awkward when you guys disclose and get a vibe from other couples. Who knows maybe another couple with the same strain would keep things interesting ### I appreciate you! Thank you for your encouraging words❤ ### ",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tmabkt/first_time_swingers_who_caught_herpes/
tn49kb,"Trip Advice Please - 25M, OHSV1, GHSV2 Hello All, I’m a 25yo male that was diagnosed with Oral1 and Gen2 in Sept.2021 from and interaction during vacation in Miami July.2021.

I’ve just been so down since, to say the least, that I’ve cancelled or avoided all trips big or small and even local night outs. 

This upcoming trip however the flights are non refundable so I’m using that as an excuse to try to get out and live a little again.

I’ve kept my diagnosis to myself except for a long distance friend and have worked from home majority of the past few months. Only times I go out consistently are to the office or gym. 

But because I’ve had little experience with the virus outside my own bubble, I’ve never had to disclose or prepare for possible intimate interactions. Meaning idk how to disclose or what transmission rates are depending on different acts. 

Im fairly worried for this upcoming trip this weekend will present possible opportunities to be physically intimate again. 

I’ve tried to educate myself but a single google is already extremely convoluted, contradictory and not to mention discouraging and fear generating. 

This group has been my best resource so I’d greatly appreciate just any general advice about preparing for such a trip or for these things in general regardless of location or vacation. 

For example, what if I receive oral sex, what are the transmission rate or implications of the person performing on me? Like is the performer guaranteed to contract? Also, If they perform oral on GHSV2 and then we kiss, will my OHSV1 turn into OHSV2? What’s the transmission rate of me performing oral to a females genitals? Will performing oral flare my OHSV1 and cause a breakout as well? I’m unaware of transmission during inter course as well. 

Apologies if these are dumb questions I’m really not well educated enough on this and that’s probably why I contracted in the first place. 

Huge thanks in advance for any tips big or small about anything. Or even resources.
❤️

Edit: I’m on day 2 of 5 of valacyclovir in anticipation of the trip as well",2,2022-03-24 16:58:23-04:00,"I can’t help you with some of this because I truly have no idea, I’m new to this all myself. But I will say if you preform oral on someone else you could give them GHSV1, Even without sores. I got it from my partner who has OHSV1 and didn’t know, meaning no sores ever or when we were intimate. So that is definitely possible. I also know that if they preform oral on you, you could give them OHSV2 but I think those numbers are lower but I’m not entirely sure. I think since you’ve had it for awhile you have enough antibodies that will keep you from getting OHSV2 . Again I’m not entirely sure about it all because I’m new to this too but Just sharing my experience ### Thank you for your input! At least it’s something.

tn3zft,"Herpes or something else? (nsfw) A little over a month ago I had semi-protected sex and felt feverish a few days later. Tongue got extremely sore and swollen along with my tonsils. It was really hard to swallow and function in general but I eventually got better, although I'm still fatigued with some brain fog. A couple weeks later I felt itchy near where my balls meet my thigh and checked under there to see some red pimples developing. No pus but feels like a bad rash is very uncomfortable to work outdoors with when it gets sweaty. Worried it's HSV but could be foliculitis or an ingrown hair or something. Would also mention that the follicles were tender and I pulled a few hairs a couple nights ago but it usually doesn't result in this kind of outbreak...

The only two times I've had outbreaks was when I went back to taking Adderall again.  I suspect Adderall affects the immune system negatively and Herpes takes advantage of this and outbreaks in a nasty way.  When I had an outbreak before I started Adderall for the first time, it was a small lip cold sore outbreak.  But when I was without any outbreak lip cold sore for 7 months and I took an Adderall pill for the first time, bam I immediately noticed a nasty base of lip cold sore that was larger and more painful than the previous one.

tmtcr4,"Equivocal Hi all, 

I've been dating my boyfriend for around 5 months. He disclosed himself as positive to me before we ever were sexual and when I pressed for more information, said that he was given an igH test after seeing a very small red bump that did not blister on his shaft prior. I forgot the value of this test but it was borderline, essentially equivocal. Two doctors other than the one who administered the IgH said that they didn't think it was herpes. He still went on antivirals, I don't go down on him, and we always use a condom. None of his former partners tested positive for herpes. We waited a while to have sex because I was so anxious. I feel horrible for putting that stigma on him but I couldn't really help it. Honestly, I wish he did not tell me. He recently got a iGG test 8 months after his suspected infection. It was equivocal at 1.06. He had mono at the time his blood was drawn which is a form of herpes virus. The AHA says that this should be considered negative (under 1.1) and his doctor said to use protection like normal but that we're basically in the clear. The anxiety over this has been the number one negative in our relationship. Can we let it go now? The stress is killing me and someone who I love very much. Should he get the western blot? Lmk.",3,2022-03-24 14:21:30-04:00,"Let's say hypothetically he has it. You have seen how much it physically affects him (seems not much at all). So let's say you hypothetically get it from him.

The tests are so inaccurate and I don't want to be in the same sort of limbo that he is in. But I'm not sure if I could deal with not being honest with a new partner.

Condoms conservatively reduce the risk by another 50% (with both condoms and antivirals it's 2.5%) but Teri Warren's research suggests that condoms may reduce transmission by 90-96%, putting your risk at well under 1% per year if y'all have sex approximately 2-3 times a week.

However, a few days ago the depression started to creep up and I’m feeling pretty down about this and how it will affect my life in the future and my future love life.

It really doesn’t help that my giver isn’t giving me the best support throughout this and I know I shouldn’t expect anything from anybody… but maybe a little compassion for giving me something that’s for life would be nice…. We were just starting to get to know each other and I made the mistake of getting too drunk one night and allowing myself to have unprotected sex without asking his sexual history. I have several friends with STIs so I am very adamant about practicing safe sex. 

This whole situation has been really awkward and I’m trying to navigate through it day by day, but he is truly pissing me off with the way he is handling this. If anything I’ve been more supportive of him being devastated that he did this to me. He “didn’t know” his status, so this wasn’t anything intentional. I just feel like I’m comforting him more for his feelings than I’m being comforted for mine and it’s a little annoying. 

I maybe could see a future with us, because he seemed like a great person before all of this, but a part of me also feels like maybe I should hate him for the way he is handling this. Not for doing this to me, but for his lack of effort and compassion. 

We’ve rarely spoken since he came back and confirmed he was positive, which means he was indeed the one who gifted this to me.

Reddit:
If you are uncomfortable reaching me on TikTok or my instagram I can be reached on reddit I have a page dedicated to herpes (it was the first place I posted my story) Mylovelyladylumps6

r/herpes: subreddit is a useful tool to ask questions and connect with others who also have herpes. There are many positive outlooks as well as tips and tricks to dealing with herpes. HOWEVER do tread with caution the subreddit occasionally gets depressing and people do end up wallowing in self pity on there a lot. There are also occasionally posts about how it is unnecessary to disclose to partners which I DO NOT agree with. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/HSVpositive/ is a supportive non judgmental community for people living with herpes (hsv-1 or hsv-2).

https://www.reddit.com/r/HSV_r4r/ this subreddit is for social and dating purposes. It's brand new and worth a shot for people who are fed up with positive singles or not ready to disclose to a non herpes person. It is literally brand spanking new so I have no opinion on it yet but I am hopeful that it will be great. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/HSV_r4r/:  seems to be a place for people with hsv to form connections. Basically a bunch of singles looking. 

r/HerpesCureResearch: this subreddit is dedicated to information about the cure and other herpes research progress. It is extremely interesting however do not fall down the rabbit hole and hyper focus on the cure. There is no telling if the cure will be successful or will work for both types, or even be available to the public right away. It is definitely interesting to look at but sometimes people will sit around and wait to start dating until the cure comes out that that is not the best tactic. 

r/HerpesPersonals & r/Herpes Dating: these subreddits are more for herpes meetups and people looking to date or friends in a similar herpes situation. 

r/HerpesPics: this subreddit is NSFW and is basically a place to post a questionable sore. Whether it's to figure out a diagnosis or if something is a razor bump or an outbreak. WARNING THERE ARE PICTURES OF HERPES HERE. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimsWithHSV/ : A community for Muslims diagnosed with HSV (herpes simplex virus) to be able to connect and find support from fellow Muslims who are also facing the struggle of having this condition. Herpes is not a topic that you can talk to your friends and family about, especially as Muslims. So, it can be incredibly lonely at times. However, this subreddit, proves that you are not alone and is a place where you can find advice and support that you need as well as where you can offer it to others.

Dating Websites:
Positive Singles: this dating APP is catered to people with STIs (mainly herpes, hpv, HIV & AIDS). You can make it as private as you like by not posting anything but a bio until you decide to reveal photos of yourself to another person or you can set it up like a regular dating app. The cool thing about the app is that everyone on there has something so disclosing isn’t nearly as stressful. 
Things I personally did not like:
A lot of the features required you to pay for the app
Anyone from anywhere and any age can message you so it is hard to weed out who you want to talk to 
It seems easy to trauma bond on there if you and the other person were both recently diagnosed (so be careful and don’t settle for anything less than you deserve!)

2. HSV Dating on Facebook: this Facebook group has over 4 thousand members and is not a support group but a way to romantically meet people with hsv. Mission Statement:NOT A SUPPORT GROUP This group is a safe place for those 18+ years old navigating the HSV+ dating world by allowing us to get to know one another in a group setting. This group is all inclusive for all types of dating.May you find what you are looking for in a partner! https://www.facebook.com/groups/358851731762247/?ref=share

3. LGBTQIA 🏳️‍🌈 Herpes Support & Dating Group: This is a private group for members of the HSV/HPV community who identify as LGBTQ. This Group will not appear anywhere on your profile, and only those within the group can see who the members are and what is posted. No new profiles will be accepted. Over 600 members here! https://www.facebook.com/groups/386952082056743/?ref=share

tm07cp,Lip Filler activates herpes This is a PSA to anyone thinking of getting lip filler. Don’t do it. I’ve lived my entire life not knowing I had HSV-2 and I got my lips done in October. A week later I’ve had reoccurring outbreaks since then every month that are very painful and give me flu like symptoms. I’ve done so much research and saw that there’s like a 2% chance lip filler can cause herpes reactivation and usually it’s HSV-1 but I think my issues have been traced back to the filler because I never even noticed I had it until then. My life has been changed and I’m hoping once the filler dissolves everything will go back to normal.,2,2022-03-24 03:19:15-04:00,Do you mean it triggered a genital outbreak? Lip fillers can rarely trigger oral herpes but not genital herpes. ### Yes it definitely triggered it. I didn’t even test positive for HSV-1.

tmg2q9,"HSV-1 Confirmed: Only Ever get One Blister, Is this Normal? Hello!

&#x200B;

So I am HSV-1 confirmed. I contracted it about 6 months ago for the first time. When I got it, I got ONE blister on the inside of my lip. But, it was a major blister, and super painful. It also affected the right half of my tongue, and the right half of my upper gums. My tongue would burn and get inflamed taste buds, and my gums were extremely swollen and burned.  It took a couple weeks to go away and man, the pain.

&#x200B;

Anyway, I'm curious if anyone else experiences HSV-1 this way? From what I've seen, they're usually clustered blisters on the outer edge of the lips. Mine expresses itself as a single blister in the same spot on the inside of my lip. 

&#x200B;

One more thing, I don't feel like I've gotten a break since my original infection. Over the past 6 months it feels like it's only a week and then it tries its best to reappear. I take Valaciclovir whenever I feel a new blister pop up to combat it and it usually prevents it from getting any worse. But dang, any relief? And how can I best help my immune system to build up protection? I'm not sure if how I take the antiviral is effective or could be negatively impacting my ability to build resistance.

tks6ng,"The guy I’m seeing gave me HSV-2. Is this a good msg to send to him? PSA - I don’t feel the need to explain myself to every person on why I believe he is the person who gave me herpes, I have all the info I need to know that it was. That’s not what I’m asking for advice on. 

I’m so nervous about sending a message. I really like him. I’m 99.9% sure it had to be him that gave me HSV-2, I was screened for STI’s before I slept with him, and I have only had sex with him since (unprotected😶). 

FYI - I have only ever slept with him unprotected, I haven’t had sex with anyone else for months. He was having unprotected sex with another person the same time he was sleeping with me, and didn’t tell me. Over a week after I slept with him I started experiencing all the symptoms, sores, fevers, body aches etc. 

Is this a good msg to send to him? 

“So I went to have an STI check and it came back positive for HSV-2 (herpes). I’ve only slept with you since I was last screened, so maybe you should get checked too. I have mild symptoms, you could be asymptomatic, which is maybe why you didn’t know. I’ve done a lot of research and from what I’ve read, it’s actually just more like a rash that comes and goes, shouldn’t impact sex or anything, but the stigma around the STI is the worst part. This isn’t ideal, and It does suck, especially because I’ve never had an STI before. Lowkey freaking out, but I’m hoping we can talk through this, and work it out together. Feel free to take some time, do some research, and let me know how you feel, and what you’re thinking when you’re ready. Hopefully you’d like to talk about this in person on the weekend, I just thought you should know asap”

I really like him and I’m scared this will ruin the relo we are building since it’s so fresh. Help!!!",105,2022-03-23 07:53:51-04:00,"I think this is a lovely message. It’s not accusatory and gives him space to look into it. One silver lining of HSV is it can show people’s true colours. He should be grateful for your openness, though of course might be upset himself, but should ultimately respond with kindness. Don’t beat yourself up if it doesn’t go this way - you’ve simply dodged a person who’s not right for you. ### That’s really really nice. Most people would be furious throwing around accusations being very aggressive and wanting to end things in a lot of cases! For you to be that nice and be concerned about him wanting to continue is super sweet. The world needs more people like you ### UPDATE - he responded well too. He said: 

“I will definitely go get checked and I feel terrible if I’ve given it to you. I’ll do some research but I have been asymptomatic, and I hope we can talk and work this out together. I’ll try to go and get my screen straight after work this afternoon, thank you for letting me know. Are you okay?” ### That’s such a good message! ### Just know it can lat dormant in your system for years. ### I think it’s a pretty awesome message. Lucky dude to have someone that is understanding in the whole situation. ### I think that’s a message he’ll respond well too.  You aren’t being angry or accusatory.  You’re sharing pertinent information.  

I hope it goes well! ### If he responds to this in any way other than sweet I’ll beat him up for you. This message is so mature and sweet! He’s a lucky guy. ### Far nicer than the msg I sent which went

“Hey so you gave me herpes which is shitty, the blister on your crotch wasn’t just an I grown hair but a herpes blister. You need to get tested, medicated if your symptoms are rough and disclose to any future sexual partners so that they can make an informed decision about their health” I then blocked him because I did not want to entertain the whole “no it wasn’t me who gave it to you” I literally get tested before every partner and several months after a partner & previously had never tested positive for it. Also this relationship wasn’t a happy healthy one and I was angry at him. I think ur message is very well considered. 

Also off topic but this is wild, the std nurse told me I didn’t have to disclose because I asked if they had a disclosing service so it didn’t have to come from me. I decided that ethically, I should let them know because clearly they had sysmtoms before I did and were in denial about it, so I felt like I should make it clear to them. Wild tho that a health provider would say that ### Counseling student here! The only thing that I’m seeing is using “you” in the message. We’re taught to use i or we statements. For example: “you could be asymptomatic, which is maybe why you didn’t know” could be “a lot of people are asymptomatic, which is maybe why we didn’t know.” ### Girl I was in the same boat in February 🙊 it’s scary but you gotta trust your gut, the right person will stick by you and the ones who aren’t meant to be won’t . I think you got this either way 🙏. Send it , way better than how I wrote mine ! :) ### Just went through this exact sinerio couple of weeks ago...I think the message is great but I did it in person. It was HARD but I would definitely recommend in person. It would be horrible waiting for a reaction/message. It's much easier to continue a conversation about it and remove any assumed to tone if you're sitting next to him. Was definitely one of the scariest things I've done but it felt so much better after. Good luck!!!

Side note, unless you specifically ask to be tested for HSV the regular sti panel does NOT include any test for it. It's only included if you have symptoms generally ### Just a question, not an accusation. Were you screened for HSV during your STI panel before sleeping with him? Herpes is often not checked for unless specifically asked about.

It's possible you are the carrier and haven't had symptoms until now. ### Great message! ### Looks kind and gracious. Let us know what he says. ### This is a great message. You two might as well stay together and work out the relationship. ### Just went through this exact sinerio couple of weeks ago...I think the message is great but I did it in person. It was HARD but I would definitely recommend in person. It would be horrible waiting for a reaction/message. It's much easier to continue a conversation about it and remove any assumed to tone if you're sitting next to him. Was definitely one of the scariest things I've done but it felt so much better after. Good luck!!! ### Send it. ### this is the perfect thing to say!!! ### That sounds really good. ### This msg is too soft to be from someone who has just contracted. He is going to think u knew u had it and might have passed it to him and using reverse to get him to test. 

Just talk face to face.... ### TIA 🤍 ### Wait did you get checked for everything before y’all had sex ? If so then yes ### Hey, you really can’t be sure he gave it to you. I absolutely knew I had herpes for years and they tested actual sores a few times with false negative results. The message is great but I would suggest taking out the part where you basically say it’s from him and he didn’t know. He might not have it at all, in which case it will impact sex to some extent. ### STIs don't cover herpes!!!!
You have to specifically ask for herpes, it could have been dormant in you ### I would definitely do this over a phone call or in person ### If you slept with other people even protected it’s possible you got it from them also. The thing about HSV is, unlike HIV, chlamydia and gonorrhea you don’t need bodily fluids to get it just skin to skin contact. When you’re first diagnosed it’s the most troubling. However, you’ll soon realize that hsv is so common that most people have some strain of it. Your message is fine but you need to make sure that you didn’t already have it in your system. A blood test could of also been used on your previous std checkup. But if it directly after a sexual assault, it can take several months before it shows up on a test and that alone can be a reason why it could of showed clear even if you had contracted it back then. Did you do a subsequent std test after that assault before this test? ### Honestly you came about to very mature and friendly, that’s amazing of you, my situation was different, the girl lied to me and told me right after we had sex that she has herpes lool, what caused you to get checked ? Was it the rash ? And if so did you have a normal rash or hsv rash with bumps etc ### Or you could say, “hey. I think you have me herpes… pretty sure I’m fact. But I’m not mad at you. Think we should talk about things though. There’s a lot of information out there and just want to sort through it all with you.” 

I only offer an alternative because I feel like you’re being too nice. You don’t have to be mean at all, but it almost sounds like you’re to blame. ### I had this situation and he wasn’t bothered. His whole don’t care casual reaction when I was so sick told me he must have known. I was devastated and he didn’t care. I really hope you have a great outcome and he genuinely didn’t know. Trust your gut. Good luck. ### so what did he say ? ### I think the message it good but are you potentially able to have the same conversation in person? ### It’s a great message… somewhat similar to what I stated after my first outbreak and confirmed GHSV1 (confirmed by sore IgM (+), IgG (-) so primary outbreak. I told him it’s best to get tested. Mind you this was a friend i was having this discussion with… they may react in a way you will not expect: anger and frustration (while you should be the one more upset) remember to stay in a  positive mindset. You may not get the support you need from them and they might blame you. But yes this is very important to have because it can change their mindset of how to proceed with sex in the future. ### It's too kind of you, but I think the man should take some responsibilities for what he has done to you. It's NOT your fault, why you have to grovel? ### When was the last time you had sex before this guy? Like how many weeks/months ago? And when was your last STI test ### That’s really kind of you, thank you so much ☺️ ### Thankyou, dying w anxiety, and I feel like he’s a good person and wouldn’t have known ### So glad to hear that he took it well and that he checked to see how you are doing with all of this☺️ ### This makes me so happy because this is how responsible and respectful adults should be able to have these conversations, and as long as that respect and willingness to learn and communicate is in place, you'll be able to figure things out. There's really just no need to add unpleasantness or drama to the situation, and I think your message to him did such a great job of inviting this kind of interaction. It doesn't mean there won't be emotional things for you to work through as you learn about herpes, but you've given yourself such a great start <3 Also really glad you posted this to give others guidance on navigating this situation that almost none of us were adequately prepared for! ### Glad it went well!!! ### I’m so happy to see your thoughtfulness reciprocated. He seems like a good egg. Hope you both can make something of this :) ### Thankyou ### This is true, but also, we have to exercise the degree of common sense. If somebody had no symptoms  for years, and then got symptoms  only after having an encounter with one person, it stands to reason that is where they caught the infection. If it were a random test after being asymptomatic, then I could see not being able to pinpoint the cause of the infection. ### I tell ppl this and they be in denial so bad lol ### This ^ ### I was tested for STI’s prior to sleeping with him, I had a swab and blood test… and I haven’t had unprotected sex with anyone else. ### Thankyou, from what I’ve seen he’s a good egg ### Thankyou ! ### Thanks for the advice ! ### Love this ### Yes! One thing I learned that stuck from therapy and how to have meaningful discussions was the you vs I/we in conversations! ### Thankyou! ### Good on you for doing it in person!!! I don’t think I will be able to wait on Saturday and I’m making me best friend come over for support when I send it because I’m a scared asf ### we also have only been seeing each other for a small period and I don’t feel comfortable telling him with no idea what his reaction could be ### So my first thought was don’t be a door Matt. But I think actually this is a very well considered and non stigmatising message. We don’t yet know how the other person will react espec as OP tested negative for hsv before this recent partner ### Yeah it says that in their post I think ### I haven’t had any symptoms since I slept with him, I haven’t had unprotected sex with anyone else. I also had a swab at a sexual health clinic before him so I’m pretty sure ### Yes I had tests bro ### I noticed the puss filled bumps first, then more appeared. Then I got the fever, body ache etc. I’m sorry that happened to you, that really sucks ### Thanks for the advice, I guess I kind of do blame myself for not checking if he had been tested and also not wearing protection ### I replied upwards with an update ### as i said in my msg to him, we will talk on the weekend ### Months ago, all protected. With him unprotected. I went to a sexual health clinic prior to sleeping with him and a blood test and swab. He was also sleeping with someone else… ### It’s not a big deal especially if you both have it you can’t get it twice. It’s just a skin condition. People make a big deal about it and they are not educated! It happens can I happen to anybody anytime you have sex people don’t know because they don’t present symptoms. good for you for not being mad or angry! Calm yourself everything will work out the way it supposed to! Once again I was really impressed with you! I know you said you had mild symptoms,  can I ask what kind of test you were given? And what your index levels were? There’s a lot of people misdiagnosed that’s the only reason why I ask ### Thank you!! ### Thank you so much. I’m so glad it went this way, he is a good person and this does show that we can communicate and be open with each other. He’s still been the best, and I hope others can read learn from this too!!! Was scary but had to be done, even if he responded badly I would’ve been glad I sent the msg ### I’ll call the clinic today. I also haven’t had unprotected sex with anyone else. I had sex with him and a over a week later I had sores, fever, sore throat, everything, I can’t imagine that just popped up now for no reason 😭 ### No it doesn't stand to reason. Stop spreading misinformation. ### I get that, I believe I got it from my old neighbor because I had a flare up about 3 weeks after the sex but I used to sleep around so it could have come from anyone. ### Haha I just had an argument with someone on tiktok about this because she SWEARS she doesn't have it because she's been tested 😂 ### They don't test for HSV in the US unless you specifically ask for an HSV test and even then a doctor would be hesitant without any symptoms/open sores or reason to believe you were exposed.  This is because it's so common and low risk.  If they did test for it, you can look at your lab results and it should say HSV-1/HSV-2 somewhere.

Edit:. Here's a link from the CDC https://www.cdc.gov/std/herpes/screening.htm ### What did they swab? Swabs are done on outbreaks. ### Thanks! Will add it in ### Either way you do it...you WILL feel better after it's done. It's still brand new for me but I've been feeling much better mentally every day that passes. ### I thnk you wrote an excellent message. I personally wouldn't recommend doing this in person, especially if you haven't been seeing them for very long. A message is safer for you and gives them time to feel their feelings before they respond. ### so similar to me as I said. We had only started seeing each other as well! Ugh...i feel for you. It sucks but as you've been reading it's not the end of the world...you will become stronger from it :) ### She said sti i just wanted to be clear because it’s not usually included ### Yeah that’s a symptom, sorry you’re going through this but you’re strong, yeah I was tested four weeks after and it was negative, I specifically asked for a hsv test. Doctors told me from my description and the fact she uses meds and I used a condom while no outbreak, I have no symptoms and the chances are very low but I’m still going to get another test in 6 weeks but it’s mentally draining ### Yes, in that way I do think mildly hold some responsibility, so I admire you for taking that into consideration. A lot of people point the finger and don’t realize what they could get themselves into. I went full extreme and blamed myself and still deal with shame but I have more reasons than that that I battle with self esteem. It’s just one small piece.

However, I think if you come across overly nice, and self blaming he could flip the script. Whereas there could be an other way that still evokes good, healthy conversation. 

I pray the best outcome for you and I think your a sweetheart and I hope it’s respected. Whatever way you choose to say it. ### That sucks. Sorry this is happening. Seems like you have a good mentality about it though ### That’s how it happened to me. I waited a long time to have sex after my ex fiancé, then boom one random hookup in January of this year, I got HSV 2. Had all the symptoms within 4 days. My blood tests were NEGATIVE meaning this a NEW infection - my swab test was positive for HSV 2 on an active sore. I responded immediately to the antiviral. So if your blood is negative, don’t let people get you down. People that are saying it’s too “ coincidental “ need to learn some compassion for this entire community. The person who gave it to me, had a very recent STI panel and they didn’t test him for HSV and then after I had gotten my results he got the blood test and boom he was positive for HSV 2 but he’s asymptomatic. I think your text is very well worded by the way. This is something I’m still getting used to for it happened for me in January and you’re not alone. 💗 ### Exactly.  Sometimes things are just that obvious.   You’re handling this well and I commend you. ### Im like “it can lay dormant for awhile and even when yu get tested they wont test yu for it” “oH i KnOw I dOnT hAvE iT” ok yea its prolly dormant 💀💀😂 ### Thank you ### Reading that just made me feel worse about the stigma. Even the CDC says that the stigma is soo bad that it's worse to falsely tell someone they have herpes, letting them feel the shame, but maybe not have it,  rather testing everyone and letting the true positives help people potentially change their behavior... wtf ### I’ll call the clinic today, but I’m sure they did as I was sexually assaulted and they thought I did have a STI… I have only had unprotected sex with this guy and then over a week after the sex I have had all the symptoms sores, fever, body aches etc. i think that is too coincidental although I will check ### How did it go with the person you were seeing, did they have a good response? ### I I had a swab and blood test at a sexual health clinic, and I haven’t had unprotected sex with anyone else. I’m sure I was tested for herpes, I’ll call tomorrow to make sure so that Ik I’m 110% right ### I think if he flips the conversation and isn’t nice, then it’s just goodbye to him to be honest. I think I will feel better knowing I was kind and non-judgemental and also gave him the chance to response the same way. I’m sending it soon! ### I’m not sure that saying it’s “too coincdental” shows a lack of compassion.  I was alluding to that only to counter those who try and claim that you can’t blame the person you are sure gave it to you because many in these subs will try to say you’re the one who may have had it forever and not known; despite the fact that it just so happened to have occurred shortly after the first encounter in a long time. ### People are so ignorant it's hilarious ### It was emotionally charged for sure, but imo it went as well as it could have. I've told him I'm not mad and it doesn't matter because it won't change things because I have it now. But tbh, my feelings have changed some what because I actually do feel a little resentful. But I'm working through that on my own for now ### It’s from him then ### I can agree with that ### People are interesting ### I tried telling this chick cold sores are oral herpes and she was in denial so bad that she was looking up SYMPTOMS to cold sores and genital herpes 😭😭 ### I think I feel a little resentful too, but I’m hoping that fades with his response, otherwise it will suck. I hope you work through it, thanks for sharing and helping me ### Haha idk why people are so scared of it? Makes me laugh. ### Good luck with it all! :) ### Idek, she said i cant have a normal life because i cant have kids and i gotta use condoms. I just let karma do its things thats how i got it ### WTF?? that’s so messed up ### Haha I've had it for 10 years and havent used condoms lots of times. ### ",89,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tks6ng/the_guy_im_seeing_gave_me_hsv2_is_this_a_good_msg/
tls96o,"Should I retest again? Slept with girl unprotected who had HSV2 (She didn’t disclose and claims she was asymptomatic) 
Around 40 days after contact I noticed  2/3 bumps in pubic area after shaving, didn’t think anything of it because I just shaved. 

Shaved again 2 weeks after that and noticed the hard bumps turned into red blisters. These “blisters” were not grouped together and scattered throughout pubic region. After like 2 weeks I popped one and only blood came out. Eventually scabbed over and went away. Now I still have 2 of the red bumps after like 35 days that look like they might be starting to scab over. I went to doctor and he said it looks like folliculitis to him. I am unsure tho because he seemed uneducated about herpes. 

To be safe I also got a IGG blood test at 11 weeks (I know 12 weeks is best) and was negative. 

I really feel like I probably have it because these symptoms are probably not just a coincidence after I was exposed to somebody with HSV2. Although, I feel like I’m stuck in limbo. What should my next course of action be? Just wait it out and get another IGG in like a month? Just accept the negative? Hope there’s a reoccurrence and get swabbed?

tlvd7b,"Best things/worst things to say when disclosing? I have told a lot of my male friends and they have all been totally unphased. But I've yet to tell a serious potential sexual partner that I have GHSV-1 (contracted November). I actually feel way more confident in myself than I did pre-herps after the journey it put me through, and honestly thought I was past fearing rejection. But I am starting to feel a little interested in someone - and yeah, it's holding me back. Have considered just mentioning it conversationally sometime. I'm not ashamed of it and would like to reduce the stigma and increase awareness. But - I also don't want anyone to pity me, or to become a fixture for gossip. Sometimes when I've talked about it more with friends I've disclosed to, I get the sense that I might overwhelming with stats/info that *I* think they should know, but that they didn't ask for.

What have you said that's generally gotten better/worse reactions?",4,2022-03-23 22:23:58-04:00,"I grew up with it. 50 years old now.  It only scared away two guys. They were only interested in a wham bam but were presenting themselves as relationship material.  I have both types below the belt.  It’s only a big deal if you let them make it a big deal. Fyi-I always told them early on.   For me it became a way to filter out the jerks.  Growing up when-we still didn’t know much about how HIV/AiDs was contracted and who was at risk, made herpes seem inconvenient since it wasn’t deadly.  

Volunteering at elementary schools, I saw at least two kids in each classroom had sores on their lips. 

I love that your out there educating people.  I hope my story helps. ### I’m so scared for this! It’s easy for me to say to my friends. I kind of feel comforted in a way to know they don’t find me disgusting. But I’m scared of telling sexual partners because of the stigma and my name going around. I’m so terrified of it. I just don’t think I can get to that point for possibly years :/ ### I actually find it way harder to disclose to friends/family than to potential partners.

Download the herpes handbook from westover heights clinic website (it's a free pdf). They have a whole section on disclosure and how to do it, with examples. ### Ahhh I might get some practice in soon! Screw it, right? Will update with how things go... hopefully folks have some good tips!

But yeah, it's definitely made it harder to just be totally up front if I'm into someone. I'm glad it's stopped me from being too impulsive since I haven't *really* liked someone in a while, but when I do, I like to be direct and 'myself' and throw caution to the wind and now I kind of feel like that has to include me owning the herps.

They will see passed that. ### Same. For the last 16 years. Being a part of this group which I recently joined is rapidly changing my perspective. Took me too long to find this pearl ### I am gray for this group because…in my small town the ppl here judge mercilessly. I am in the process of trying to move because even though this group has helped me get to a better place about my diagnosis…my home is killing me. I attempted to “UNALIVE” myself and thank God I failed. This group helps me cope but the shame is inescapable. I’m shame for my family and friends. Because ppl tend to generalize everyone around you that accepts you. I’m nasty and gross and neither are my family and friends. And I don’t want anyone judged because of my mistakes. I just want to climb in a dark hole and go to sleep forever. ### Counselling and talking through these feelings with a therapist would be beneficial, I think. They would help to put things in perspective and drill down into why you think the way you do. Often we are harshest on ourselves, when we wouldn't even think of treating others in the way we treat ourselves. ### Just to bring it to light. Kids grow up with cold sores to adults. Some even died of old age with them. Some of which never knew cold sores are actually HSV 1. It’s nothing to be ashamed about. You can even get HSV 2 from oral with someone that has a cold sore. 1/3 of the population has HSV. I’m saying this, because HSV isn’t a “dirty” disease. It’s so easy to spread by just mere skin contact. I’m not even going to classify it as a STI because it’s not a dirty disease. Of course we still need to disclose it to partners but we need to get rid of the stigma surrounding HSV. It’s not chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis or even HIV. (No shaming on any of them! I hope they get the treatment they need!) Those are typically what most would consider “dirty STI’s” Don’t be ashamed. Live one day at a time. Be happy for who you are. :) ### Not necessarily shame like I did something wrong. But like I feel judged/less than because of this. ### That’s ohsv1 tho not ghsv2. There is a huge difference in stigma. ### Thanks. Appreciate that. ### Completely understand. But do you personally feel less because of it? I personally think I’m a catch and this does not change any of that. I can still do all the things I did before and can still offer all that I could before. If anything this was a wake up call for me and allowed me to focus on myself and really connect with with my inner self. 
I talk to myself in the mirror and compliment my self. It’s something I did in the past whenever I struggled with how I felt and it’s something that I started again and it has helped. ### This group helps cuz I judge myself harder then I judge others. So when we’re in the same condition I can’t help but be a lot nicer to me ### [deleted] ### Yeah I do because it’s heavily stigmatized and society looks down on ppl with it. Ppl will reject you for it because they don’t want to catch it. So yeah I definitely think it impacts my worth %100. ### I agree. Still sucks tho. ### Everyone has baggage and I know you’ve seen it on here plenty of times but if someone really likes you and really wants to spend time with you and be around you they won’t care. They will accept it because they want you for you as a person. They want A L L of you. They will not see you as any less than 100% just because you have hsv. you don’t want somebody that only wants part of you… nobody wants that. ### I hope you are able to get past this phase and accept your new self (I am still working on this - just confirm hsv on feb28). It’s okay to feel what you are feeling but do not allow yourself to feel like that forever. We have one life and you can still do everything you wanted to do previously. I’m extremely grateful that this is all I am dealing with. It could be soooooo much worse. This has showed me I need to 1. Educate myself on fucking LIFE and 2. Be kind to my body and treat it as a temple. We are expensiveeeeee - not everyone gets access and if I consider them worthy well you best believe we will be having the std conversation and exchanging results.

If you tested less than 12 weeks after possibly exposure , test again with igg , or get tested with western blot. The low positive doesn’t mean it’s a false positive , but that it has a greater chance of being that. ### If you tested positive on igg but negative on swab should you retest? ### Depends.  If you had an OB and had it swabbed late it could produce a false neg. So positive swabs accurate , negatives one you may have tested too late. 

Igg taken at same time as swab or very soon after that comes back positive already would likely mean it not a new infection. May have been a first OB but likely and infection that you  have had a while ( while unfortunately can mean weeks , months or even years ). 

So if your igg is a solid positive especially for hsv2 but you are swabbing negative then you could retest but probability is you are a true positive.  If a low positive and no OB or swabbed but unsure if was hsv then I would retest at 12 weeks post last exposure with Igg or get a western blot.

Your “blisters” don’t appear to have fluid in it. As a seasoned mom, it looks like ringworm— a fungal infection. 

Go to an urgent care and debate it with a medical professional. ### I mean if you call that a circle, then every herpes outbreak is technically in an abnormally shaped circle. ### Herpes blisters do not always have fluid in them.  Especially mild cases. ### If you have seen ring worm before it has a circular shape like that. ### 👍🏽 ### I mean it’s all over Google and this looks nothing like ringworm.

There’s a reason it’s called ringworm. It creates an actual “ring”.

tlkhjs,"Support for Friend/My Anxiety About Herpes I have a close friend who has recently disclosed to me that their partner for about a year has herpes. I didn’t ask any details about strain etc as I just wanted to just be supportive of their decision to stay with this person since they knew it was serious and was willing to take the risk. This person is notorious for not using protection and I have made comments about this with other partners but ultimately it’s not up to me to change their behavior. However I do think there’s a self esteem issue at work here. 

A few months have gone by and I have felt a growing anxiety about my exposure to the virus as this friend continually asks to share drinks, vapes and chapstick. We are very close and I feel like putting up this boundary with them will alienate them further and I’m not even sure if they have it! But I’ve been wiping off my vape after I share and making more excuses for sharing drinks etc because I really don’t want to expose myself and not sure if this friend will share the info with me if they find out they too have herpes. 

I’m married and I shared this information with my partner to get some insight and they are very adamant that I stop sharing saliva with this friend no matter how difficult the conversation.

I want to be supportive and caring because I love this friend but I historically am not great at putting up boundaries and am struggling to even imagine the words coming out of my mouth without sounding judgmental. This friend is sensitive and has since ended their relationship with this person and has had another sexual partner since then and hasn’t been tested as far as I know. So I know I can’t really trust her decision-making on this matter. 

While I have so much to say about their choices I know I can only control what I do and say and for me that is telling a friend that for my own comfort I would prefer not to share vapes etc in order to limit the risk for myself and my partner. 

I’ve done a good amount of research and I’d like to avoid flat out asking if this friend has contracted the virus as that is up to them to find out and share with me if they wish. I also know that the likelihood of getting it from them is minimal but still possible when we’re both slobbering over the same vape pen and chapstick. 

Help. I want to be the best friend I can be but still protect myself and my partner.",30,2022-03-23 19:18:20-04:00,"Listen, you might already have hsv1. Your husband might. Several of your other friends do, statistically. 

67% of people under 50 globally do. But you know, continue to act like your friend is diseased. That's cool and all. 🙄

Instead of worrying about an extremely common virus that so many of you have, don't share drinks, utensils, ChapStick and lip balms (!!), because of things like covid, flus, colds, strep, rhinovirus, norovirus, adenovirus and the like. 

When your whose partner has herpes - which she told you in confidence and not to judge her or share with your husband - asks to share a drink or lip balm, just say that because of covid, flus and colds, you've made the decision to not share those things anymore. Hold that true for all your friends, please. Spare this friend some dignity, please. 

And the others that posted are correct - sharing these things are an extremely inefficient way of transmitting herpes. ### Why are you so invested in this? Your post has so many judgmental comments towards your friend that go beyond just you being concerned about contracting herpes yourself. You’re an adult and don’t have to share things with anyone you don’t wish to, it’s really that simple and you don’t need any of us to tell you that. Maybe you should put this energy into your own life and quit worrying about what your friend is doing. ### You should umm learn more about how herpes is spread ### Herpes is transmitted skin to skin contact. Sharing drinks surfaces like toilet seats things like that don’t matter! I wouldn’t go around sharing drinks and stuff like that anyway but it’s skin to skin contact ### You should be more concerned about the health impacts of vaping rather than herpes. And the chances of you catching it from your friend are so slim especially because you don’t even know if she has it let alone if it’s even oral herpes (which is the only way you would get it from her unless you have sex/oral sex with her?). My advice is relax and enjoy your life, stop sweating the small stuff ✌🏼 ### Clearly you haven’t done enough research because it needs skin to skin contact to transmit. Maybe focus on actually SUPPORTING your friend ### You’re so weird ### This is so dumb and you are seriously misinformed. Just say “I don’t share” when they ask for a drink, a lipgloss, food etc etc. I have literally always said and done this since before I got hsv. If they ask why just say you don’t like sharing germs. Simple! You’re also super judgmental you probably have been exposed tons of times by someone Asymptomatic. Like wtf, be a grown up 🙄 ### Well I don’t think it’s dumb or I wouldn’t be on here risking ridicule in hopes of answers. Regardless of age this is new territory for me and I’m looking for feedback. 

You’re right. I should have better boundaries for myself given the anxiety I’m feeling now that I have not held them.

And you’re also right about the judgements I have made about my friends choices because I do disagree with some of them. But I know it doesn’t make them a lesser person and I want to encourage them to be better informed for the future without passing judgement and pushing them away. 

Thank you for your time. ### You’re right there is a chance I’ve already been exposed. I’m just trying to make the best choice with the information I have. And the truth is I have changed my behavior toward my friend and hearing more from people is very helpful in fixing that because I don’t want our relationship to change.

I have put myself in a bad spot by having poor boundaries about sharing personal items and it’s a difficult thing to go back on once you’ve shared so many times before. So my main goal is to try to put up a boundary with this friend without making them feel rejected. 

I do disagree about sharing the information with my partner. When it’s something that could affect your life long sexual partner, I believe it’s important to share that. But to you’re point, my friend likely will feel betrayed either way.

I appreciate your response. ### I read that this is a supportive community for those with and with questions about herpes…so I asked.

It’s not a crime to be invested in a friendship or to reach out for help with one. 

It’s also not a crime to have judgements about someone else’s choices. Which I admitted to having in my post. The difference is that I decided to share them anonymously to give others my point of view so I could get input on ways to communicate my feelings to my friend without judgement. 

Please don’t pass judgement on me for what I think is important. ### Based on what I have read sharing any kind of saliva is risking you to exposure including a Mayo Clinic article that says “stop sharing chapstick” in direct regard to herpes simplex virus. 

My mother has outbreaks and when she does she avoids sharing drinks etc with me. 

So If I’m really that far off, please enlighten me. 

That’s why I’m here. ### THANKYOU!!!!!!! ### Roger that. I appreciate your perspective. Thank you. ### I hoped to gain more information from the community than from medical websites and I thought this was the best way to gain personal insight into how to be more supportive. If you could offer any advice on how you feel you would want to be supported in this situation, I’d love to hear as maybe you have some personal experience? Should I be encouraging my friend to get tested or do you think that will that make them feel worse? ### We’re all weird! That’s what’s so great about the world! ### >I do disagree about sharing the information with my partner. When it’s something that could affect your life long sexual partner, I believe it’s important to share that. 

This is *such* a stretch.  You could have said one of your friends mentioned this without naming her. You've not only violated her confidentiality, but that of her partner's. 

Did you tell your partner about your mom's oral herpes before kissing him? Your mom is infectious even when she doesn't have outbreaks. If your parents are still married, there's a great chance your dad has it, too. Your grandparents, aunts, uncles - most of them probably have it. There's a good chance you do, and you don't even know. 

This is what bothers a lot of us that live with herpes. Others are very quick to judge and worry - and you did both - without having any idea of what their own status is. 

I understand that you came to a herpes support sub looking for support for your beliefs about herpes, and we're being a bit hard on you, but we live this every day. 

Have either you or your husband scheduled tests yet to find out if you have it? ### Your post about ur “friend” was more judgmental than concerning. ### But with that being said it is a good idea to stop sharing drinks and chapstick with people but HSV doesn't ever spread through saliva it spreads only through skin to skin contact with an infected person who is virally shedding which doesn't happen often. ### Herpes or not, I’ve never liked sharing drinks, chapstick, etc. I don’t think it’s weird to set this kind of boundary with a friend regardless of their status. Especially now with COVID, people shouldn’t be shocked that you don’t want to be swapping saliva with people. If you really feel uncomfortable bringing this up you can continue wiping everything down after. I do the same when people insist on crossing my boundaries mother, sister, cousin, bestie, everybody gets the wipe down and has come to expect this from me. ### Your mother has oral herpes? How long has she had it? If she had oral herpes since you were born/child then she probably kissed you before and exposed you to the virus. That's the most common way the virus ohsv1 is spread among the population during childhood. Although she may have avoided kissing during an outbreak it can still spread,  there's a chance. Majority of folks don't even know they've had cold sores in their life time and don't think they carry the virus. But since it's life long you may have had a cold sore earlier in life. Maybe not though but the possibility is there. Have you or your husband ever requested the blood test for herpes? Neither is included in a standard sti testing unless specifically requested. For all you know you or your husband are asymptomatic carries of the virus. Testing could help then you'd know what you're dealing with. ### Well there's genital and oral herpes. You never said what type but it's heavily implied your friend's ex had genital herpes. There is no way to get genital herpes orally unless you put your mouth on someone with herpes genitals. It's really just common sense maybe I'm being sensitive but your post is kind of ignorant ### That’s ok, all the best 😊 ### You’re right. I have allowed my anxiety to get the best of me and I’ve made it more about me than anything else. Thank you for this perspective. ### I appreciate your input. This makes me feel a bit better and you’re right if the conversation is difficult I can continue with the wipe downs and I shouldn’t feel bad about it. Thank you. ### I only remember my mother having cold sores when I was younger. She’s never been really open about it and I don’t expect her to be if she doesn’t want to. Since that’s been my experience I’m trying to offer my friend the same courtesy of allowing them to share what they want when they want. I’m trying to limit the additional shame I might cause with judgey questions that might push them away while trying to make informed choices for myself.

You’re right there’s a good chance one of us has already been exposed and since this is mostly about my own anxiety getting tested will ease my mind and gain me more knowledge. Thank you for your feedback. ### It’s a sensitive topic. You’re allowed to be. ### Your mother has herpes, you most likely do but not 100% of course. Get tested, both you and your partner can learn your statues and go from there. Best of luck. ### But I think you should focus more on actually being a better friend than deluding yourself into thinking your a great friend for not dropping someone with a very common virus that there is a good chance you already have. ### Yeah but going to a forum where people are dealign with their own depression and stigma to ask very judgy and somewhat stupid common sense questions that perpetuate it is very insensitive and feels very close to trolling ### ",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tlkhjs/support_for_friendmy_anxiety_about_herpes/
tly5mn,"Girl I like has HSV1 - should I be concerned? Been talking to a girl online for a while and had plans to meet her. She casually mentioned she had HSV1 (face/lips), and when I started to ask more about it she said she hadn't had an outbreak since she was in high school. Is this something I should be concerned about? She was apparently under the impression that it can't spread unless she has an outbreak but I started to research more into herpes and realized it can spread without an outbreak occurring and it can also spread from oral to genitals. She started getting upset when I was telling her about that.

I'd just like to know if I'm in the wrong for being concerned.",7,2022-03-24 01:00:22-04:00,"Definitely not wrong for being concerned. You did rightfully research. It’s your health so you have to make a educated decision based upon this info. 
You are correct. You don’t have to have a visible outbreak to pass it and yes it can spread to your genitals if you receive oral sex. ### Over 50% of the US population has it. You might even already have it and just be asymptomatic. If you deny her over it, the next person you date will likely have it and not feel the need to disclose or not know they have it. I think it shouldn’t matter, but to each their own. I dated a girl for 7 years who got a cold sore one day and I didn’t realize that meant she had herpes. I never got it, and I got a blood test for HSV2 years after we broke up and I tested negative for HSV1 so I apparently never got it from her ### Not wrong to be interested & concerned. Great that she disclosed , not great that she is misinformed about transmitting & got upset when you started to correct her. This information is readily available if person takes the time to look. 

And what other poster said is true , you could already have it and not know it.  A lot of us are asymptomatic and assume we are negative due to never having an OB.  Have you been tested, if positive then can assume it’s right , if negative then possible it’s wrong as there is a 30 % false neg rate with hsv1 igg. Generally most people won’t tell you they have hsv1 because they just don’t know themselves. ### No you shouldn’t be concerned I’m honestly surprised she disclosed. Most people have ohsv1 and symptoms stop some time before adulthood. It would be safe to say every second person you have / will kiss will have ohsv1.
While asymptomatic transmission is possible, it is very rare ### She told ya she gets cold sores. She also got irritated with the facts (most people do) . She will dump you at the sight of your first ob. (Assuming you're - )

Edit: didn't elaborate. Most people with ohsv1 will get irritated with these facts because they truly do not want to know and don't want to be schooled ### That’s so awesome she told you!! Most of us didn’t get that and end up with it on our genitals because people don’t tell us… people who know their status are way safer then people who DON’t and it’s highly respectable she educated herself on the matter. ### Not true regarding asymptomatic transmission being rare. Most of us have gotten it that way. 

In general you are not going to kiss or have sex with someone who is having. an OB so most transmission is happening when there are no visual symptoms. ### ",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tly5mn/girl_i_like_has_hsv1_should_i_be_concerned/

tkx32j,"update 34 yo female HSV2+ Valtrex anyone? Last week I wrote about my diagnosis from a bitter and angry mental place. I've since done a lot of reading in this forum, spoken with a friend who has had HSV-2 for 12 years, my friend and ex boyfriend who is a molecular biologist analyzed STD panels for his job and my sister. I'm very lucky to have such a knowledgeable and supportive group of people around me! My friend talked to me about her outbreaks and what it's been like dating with it. She told me to always be upfront with men before any sexual contact and to give them a day to think on it and do their own research before moving forward. She is also a mother of a healthy beautiful girl, which gives me hope for the future.

My ex very patiently listed the statistics around HSV and told me I shouldn't dwell on who gave it to me. He recently contracted HSV1 from his current girlfriend and we laughed a little about the irony. This is a bit controversial and something I need to do more research on, but he told me he didn't want me to take the antiviral every day and only to take it when I felt the tingly of an outbreak. He said it's less effective later in life and I could experience bad side effects from taking it every day. Some context: we broke up years ago, but are still close friends and share a love of hiking, backpacking and caving.

My sister said, what's the big deal? I got HSV1 from the kindergartens kids I work with! More reason to make men respect you and wear protection! 

Lucky me for my support group! ♥️ Not a word about the fact that I used to be a sex worker. Nothing about how I haven't been married or in a relationship longer than six years. They all told me they loved me at the end of our conversation. I'm happy crying! I know I won't get this positive of a reaction from everyone. That's fine and the people who will look down on me aren't the kind of people I want in my life. I can use this as a filter for people who want to be with me for the person I am and keep people out of my life who look for excuses to judge and look down on others. 

Anyone who takes Valtrex daily, please share your thoughts and experience. Thank you for reading. ♥️🙏🤗",1,2022-03-23 11:51:13-04:00,"I’m glad you have such a great support group! 

In terms of Valtrex, I have heard claims that it’s not great to take long term but doctors prescribe it for daily usage and I take it daily. It really depends on your preference. Before my current relationship, I took it before/during an outbreak( I get them 4-5 times a year), but now I take it daily. My boyfriend asked me to so it would lower his risk of transmitting and because he sees that my outbreaks are painful and emotional for me, so he wants me to do it for myself as well. I’ve noticed that in my experience I really have to take it everyday (preferably at the same time) for it to be effective. If I skip a dose or two, I might break out. The only side effect I’ve really noticed is I tend to get a little dehydrated when taking it so I make sure to drink a lot of water. I also think that staying healthy in general has helped reduce my outbreaks- not drinking, no marijuana ( this triggered outbreaks for me), limit stress, etc. and more exercise, healthy eating, taking daily vitamins. I haven’t seen any legitimate studies saying long term valtrex use is bad so maybe look into that. ### ",9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tkx32j/update_34_yo_female_hsv2_valtrex_anyone/

Usually symptoms subside completely after a year or two. You might find that they’re already not as bad as they were at first. 

Stress is a trigger, so do what you can to get your mind off of it. Hobbies, regular exercise, a relatively clean diet, can all help reduce the chance of recurring symptoms. Some people have different triggers, like peanut butter, chocolate, coffee, maybe gluten? Try cutting some of these out for a few weeks each to see if it helps at all. ### Is that where your outbreak was? ### Yes ### I think the skin can stay very sensitive for a while after an outbreak.

tljpqi,"Just a little rant So, a week and a half ago I started getting painful sores, a fever, and many other awful symptoms. Anyways, I decided to go get tested. After the most painful pelvic exam because I was so inflammed and had so many open sores, all the doctor said was it looks like herpes and sent me to go get blood tested for other stds.

Later that day I got a notification from my pharmacy that I had medication to pick up and so I went and got it, it was Valacyclovir so I started taking that based on the pharmasists instructions.

A few days later, I get my results back. Turns out they put my swab in an expired container so they could not perform the test. I got a bunch of negatives on my blood test though. The clinic said I could come back and get a new test with no charge. However, they were out of swabs so I'd have to wait but I couldn't because I was home on spring break from uni.

Anyways, today I went to another clinic to get tested again. I called yesterday and they said they'd just perform a blood test since I'm on medication and my sores are almost all healed. I get in and talk to the doctor. She says that they don't do blood tests for hsv and exained why. She said I'll just have to wait until my next ob and then I'd come in to get a swab done.

I'm so upset because I just want an answer! Right now I'm just assuming I have herpes based on what the first doctor said. And I'm mad at her because all she said to me was ""looks like herpes but we'll see with this swab for sure"" and then sent me to get blood drawn! It's so frustrating.",2,2022-03-23 19:02:09-04:00,"Hey there! Totally understand your frustration! I’ll never forget when I asked my doc “so when will I not be in pain anymore?” He goes “well IF the swab determines it is herpes the medication should work very quickly” so if you responded well to the Valtrex - I’d go with the assumption you have HSV. I got my diagnosis in January my first OB - since then I get “episodes” where I’m fluish, or feel nerve pain in my thigh down to my foot and that’s how I know to double up on the Valtrex.

tlif3c,"Besides shortenings outbreaks, what is the benefit to taking Valcyclovir or other antivirals? Hello all,

Recently diagnosed with gHSV-1 via swab. Had my first outbreak about 3ish weeks ago.  Because I was diagnosed about a week into the outbreak, I was prescribed Valcryclovir but didn’t end up taking it because the doctor said it wouldn’t help at that point.  I also read that some people say it’s good to not take antivirals for the first outbreak.

My question is:
Besides helping outbreaks clear faster, is there any benefit to taking antivirals? I understand that if you take it daily it can help eliminate outbreaks all together, but is there a benefit if you’re only taking them during an OB?  Does it help you not have another OB for a longer amount of time?  Just need a rundown on it I guess.  

Super new to all of this, sorry if these are dumb questions.  This sub has helped me a lot.  Thank you all in advance",1,2022-03-23 18:14:15-04:00,Halfs the transmission rate I think ### ,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tlif3c/besides_shortenings_outbreaks_what_is_the_benefit/

Similarly some people take daily supplements of l-lysine and red marine algae and swear by them to fend off outbreaks, but others find they are of little benefit. In a similar vein some people avoid certain foods, such as chocolate or nuts which contain arganine as these can be triggers for them. Others can eat whatever they like. Everyone is different.

The herpes handbook from westover heights lists a few supplements but points out that there are few rigorous, academic studies (often not peer reviewed) to back up the claims that these supplements are effective.

I suspect part of the issue is that these are natural treatments which cannot easily be patented and marketed by pharmaceutical companies, so there is not the funding/interest for more studies.

Looking at that study you linked, there's limited info on how the tests were actually conducted but it sounds like they were injecting herpes viruses/infected cells with essential oils - this is not the same as applying them topically to an already infected patient... so I'm not sure how valid it is to generalise this study to your average person with hsv1/2.

I think the best approach is to try some supplements out (provided it's done safely - ask your dr if unsure) and see what works best for you. At the moment the most effective treatment, with the most research backing it up, would be antiviral medications. ### ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tlepqs/i_need_someone_smart/

Recently I asked her what would have happened if I didnt tell her.   She said she'd be pissed, she wouldn't trust me and would likely leave me ### Treat others how you’d like to be treated. My first outbreak was the worst pain of my life. It’s not like that for everyone, but it was for me. I was completely alone and lost and the person who transmitted did not admit to doing so until a while later on. If they had told me, I still would’ve stayed. If I love someone it doesn’t matter. But having that happen out of the blue and feeling so frightened and losing trust with that person was really hard on me. ### I can see where you’re coming from. I feel like that too. Why do I have to disclose, when they don’t get tested and always are trying to talk me out of using condoms? 
But on the other hand; every time you’re with someone it has potential to become something more. A friendship, a romantic relationship. Maybe not. But I would hate to ruin the chances of having a good relationship with someone because they lose trust in me.
There would also be the risk that people that’s been with me at some point will realize I either gave them herpes or that I have it, hearing it from someone else. Then they would be mad and I would be known as a person that just go around and give people herpes without caring. 
I heard that one of my co workers gave one of the others herpes. When she confronted him he said “so, I can’t do anything about it, live with it”. I don’t think she knew. I thought it was disgusting (I didn’t have it myself then). Not because of the herpes itself, but because he didn’t care. 
So idk. I think it’s unfair that we have to disclose a sti that’s not harmful and that most people haves but I also think it’s a sign of character. ### Reading this comments idk man lmao i tell regardless not worth getting killed beat shot etc etc ### I mean fair point imo ### if its just a hook up and you're okay with being a bad person, i can see it. ### Same, I didn't use condoms with random hook ups and 10 years later I'm paying the price. ### The person who did this to me was asked point blank beforehand and chose not to disclose.

I got it from someone who didn’t disclose. We used condoms and did everything right. Had he told me beforehand, I probably wouldn’t have done it, because it was just a hookup. My first OB was extremely painful and I wouldn’t wish it upon anyone, so I plan to get comfortable with disclosing ### That's a crappy attempt to justify shitty ass behavior. ### Amd this is why we keep getting fucking infected ### I think you should disclose but also ask them for their status I think that would be the fair thing for both of you. You knowing your status doesn’t mean it’s okay for them to not know theirs. ### I honestly agree. And Herpes is so common and undiagnosed that it’s really easy to just act like you didn’t know you had it ### No, the person knew they had oral herpes but was not educated about disclosing or the fact that it could be transmitted to the genitals.

I've said this before in a different post. We assumed that people a truly took their sexual health seriously and responsibly like most of us did but the reality is that the majority just don't.

I tested myself every 6 months. I had the STD conversation with everyone I played with. Which leads me to understand now most people lie or uneducated. Though, I have educated the person who gave me their HSV, he still doesn't see any reason to disclose to future partners.

It is irresponsible for people to not know their STD status. Yes the tests are inaccurate but that is why you should still test because when it is accurate, it's accurate and you fucking know this. ### Uhm no. You literally know you have this- disclose it. End of story. ### really tired of seeing this viewpoint from ppl in this subreddit. no one should be discriminated against for a medical condition they cannot control; however, that doesn’t mean you get to ignore its existence. ppl w this mindset need to grow up and stop being so incredibly selfish ### I had protected sex and still somehow got it. If he would have told me. I still would’ve had sex with them, I wasn’t opposed by sex with someone who has been diagnosed. He didn’t tell me and I still got it and denies it to this day. It would’ve been better if they’d disclose so i wasn’t completely blindsided by it ### 100% you should disclose every time. You’ve gotta put yourself in the other person’s shoes and like someone else said.. Wouldn’t you want to be disclosed to and not have this randomly pop up in your life? Everyone’s mindsets and coping mechanisms are different and everyone’s OBs are different. Some OBs are mild while some are on the complete opposite spectrum and are extremely painful. Whether you truly care for the person you’re with or it’s just a hook up, they deserve to at least know what could happen. 

My situation was an asymptomatic situation and it was given without anyone knowing that they had it. It has completely ruined the relationship and the other person’s mindset. They’ve fallen deep into depression and I feel awful about the situation. Wish I would’ve known so I could have disclosed in all honesty. ### I feel like that too. if someone asks sure ill tell them but if not then Im not going to bring it up ### That’s totally fine! And if they get it hopefully they’ll castrate you for it to! - In reality you’re a shitty person if this is your attempt to justify being a low life pos. ### I have oral & ghsv-1 I “think”. All PCR swabs of inital “OB” came back negative. However now I just ask if ppl have had cold sores, if they say yes then I feel safe since they wouldn’t be able to get it twice. I’m unsure how I would go about it with confirmed hsv-2 though, probably state it the different type since it would be much easier to catch if they do not have it. ### I strongly believe and understand this post. But I found a guy I really like and he’s amazing so far and I wouldn’t want to enter into a relationship without telling him because it would put a huge trust gap within our relationship. 

I suppose this could apply to any random hookups. They didn’t bother to ask just like I didn’t so it takes two to tango right. 

But if contracting GHSV1/2 has made you more cautious of who you let in ….or …. Go in…… haha..  then the disclosure becomes more important if you’re looking for a forever human. 💛 ### I got it from my gf, kinda pissed about it. I thought cold sore was a broad term to explain canker sore since I've always had them. Well I wish she would of elaborated the seriousness before we tongue wrangled.

&#x200B;

My fault, in reality, but I just wish she would've elaborated more. ### Education about hsv is dire, pretty much universally. There are a great many people here who had no idea what hsv was before they contracted it, hence they were unable to ask the right questions and take full precautions before they had sex. 

There are so many posts here ""If I had only known"" ""I didnt know it wasn't tested for when I asked about their sti testing"".

If you know you have it, you have the opportunity to discuss this with your partner by opening the conversation. You may even be sat there thinking ""well they asked about an STI panel and I know hsv isn't on there so I'm technically not lying when I say my panel came back clean"". That to me is wrong and I would feel pretty shitty omitting hsv in that conversation.

It is not our fault or the fault of our partner that our society is not better educated about hsv. Once we get that knowledge, I believe it is a moral obligation to make sure we are on the same page and use the opportunity to educate. 

If a partner said to me ""I've only been tested for chlamydia"" and I slept with them, and I caught another sti, well that's on me for accepting.

Personally I could never justify sleeping with someone, unprotected, when I knowingly had I an sti. Its just wrong and shows very little consideration or compassion towards the human you are sleeping with. ### I literally don't know who gave it to me and I don't careeeee. This is a lame ass virus lmao ### I sometimes agree with the “don’t ask don’t tell” bit. But also agree that you can’t fully consent without disclosing all the known information. It’s a battle sometimes because I don’t think some people would tell me if roles were reversed.  sometimes I don’t want to disclose in a casual situation but like another poster said, you’re in a pickle if you date….but what’s add to me disclosing regularly is that someone said I could be sued if I gave someone hsv due to knowing and not disclosing…not sure that’s common in the slightest though. And crazy hard to prove. But I figure if someone reacts poorly toy hsv status, they wouldn’t deal well with actual major stressors so wouldn’t want to date them anyhow. ### This is terrible and never gonna stop because people don’t take other peoples feelings/body’s into consideration I was recently giving ghsv-1 from someone with oral -hsv1 who never disclosed to me… and it’s ruined me. I cry everyday multiple times a day and hope I don’t wake up… it would be the best part of my life if I didn’t wake up tomorrow.. do you really wanna do that to someone ? I was so happy and had a great life before this. ### Bam. ### Yup just went through this last year completely ruined my life and we have a kid together smh! I just feel so much Shame behind it idk how to disclose to people, especially because i have to follow it up with my rape story 11 years later i still cry about it. ### that happened with my boyfriend he said, “And? everyone gets herpes its super common, at least its something you can live relatively healthy. are you coming or not lol we’re still having sex.” ### I would like to talk. This happened to me. Losing love and have this happen is a double whammy. ### Many people have hsv1. Not so many have hsv2. 

If you don't talk about it, you don't know what they have. I made it to my 30s having neither. If 67% of people under 50 globally have hsv1, that's still 33% who don't. 

If they won't get tested and don't want to use condoms, they don't sound like good sex partners to me. How do you know they don't have something they can transmit to you? Sounds like a great time to say next... You deserve way better. :) ### Happened to me. I loved him. He didn’t care. 4 years in I still struggle with the latter. Any help appreciated… ### Okay with being a bad person? Dont think thats fair. There's a lot more to it ### Personally, I think it shows a lot about a person's character. It's not easy to disclose in the moment, especially in the beginning, but it shows substance of character and for conscientious people is far easier than having to live with the fact you've lied (or lied by omission) and given someone you care about a disease that could have been avoided. ### You sound like a decent person. Once you get comfortable with disclosing it's so much less of a big deal ### You used and got infected
Did u see any rash or sth on his genital area? 
So even if u disclose how you're gonna protect people
I heard it's very rare wuth condoms ### I understand what you’re saying. But if someone has HIV and is transmittable (early stages of treatment), is holding that back “okay” to? To give someone a potentially deadly disease that there is no cure for? ### Did she even understand it? ### Agreed. I dont how ever agree that it ""gets better"". I personally don't feel like I should just go on normally knowing I got it. Or think its fair giving it to someone else willing or unknowingly. Feel like I'm missing out in life. I didn't want to bring negativity but its just how I feel. ### I promise you it does get better. The fact you have ghsv1 means that you have a very low liklihood of transmitting the virus and statistically you are way less likely to have outbreaks once you've passed the 1 year mark. ### Lmao that's cute ### Feel free to message me or anything you’d like! Sorry this happened to you ### About 25% of the population have HSV2, I would say that’s a lot. And if people actually got tested that would be a lot higher. Either strain is still herpes so 🤷🏼‍♀️

Oh, I know. But people often don’t know they have it because they just assume they don’t or that it’s included in the tests they do get. When I say “don’t get tested” I mean for herpes. 

Well, I don’t - that’s why I always use condoms. I don’t have sex with people that won’t use them, but that doesn’t mean a lot of (potential) sex partners haven’t tried to get out of it - which means I won’t have sex with them ;) 
I think you’ve misunderstood my comment. ### It's been 4 years. Don't give him one more day. It's his loss, not yours. 

Take your power back and shine like the prize you are. :) ### I agree with you, but i dont see mainstream society agreeing with us. maybe i should word this idea better. i dont think being labelled a ""bad person"" in a society obsessed with ""doing the right thing"" hypothetically, while ignoring the actual material consequences of those morals, is that bad of a thing. people have risky sex. we, unfortunately, are not ignorant of our status so we will be labelled bad while others go out and infect others but they are ignorant so they are ""good."" ### I appreciate that! Haven’t needed to yet (not interested in sex with anyone at all right now), but hopefully it’ll get easier later on ### I didn’t see anything :( Could’ve had something on his testicles due to where I got my first outbreak :/ There is no 100% way to protect someone, but it seems to me that disclosing helps protect others more (along with other safe sex practices/medication) because then it gives the other person a choice if they wanna risk it. That way you did your part ### I think this is what eldr is saying... no it's not fair to discriminate against someone with a (usually) mild, non dangerous viral infection but it's also not okay for people to go around saying ""oh it's mild, it's not dangerous, I don't care and you shouldn't care either so I'm not going to disclose"". HIV should absolutely be disclosed too. ### ?? I didn't understand it. ### I think how you are feeling is normal for a lot of people. How long have you had hsv? I had this mentality in the early days but realised that, really, it's not such a big deal and most of the burden we put on ourselves with our own judgements. It's not up to us to decide if a person is willing to sleep with someone with hsv. If you take all the necessary precautions it's totally possible to have a fulfilling sex life and not miss out. Hell, it's possible even if you don't take precautions, so long as you are honest with your partners about it. At a certain point it's best to accept that others have autonomy over their own body and sex life and you can work through your own anxieties about it with them. Many people really don't have much of an issue with hsv, even though they may be negative. ### I’ve already had two 😭 ### ""Good"" until they get caught out and a partner tells them they've just been diagnosed and asks why they now have hsv. Then they become the asshole that didn't bother to get checked. Not my personal belief, just what I've seen on this subreddit i.e the posts you see from people who cannot believe they now have hsv and blame their partner entirely, without any thought about their own role in contracting hsv. ### It took me a while to get back into it, you'll get there don't worry and you'll be a stronger person for it once you're fully comfortable with it ### My example is definitely exaggerated but it does bring up the question that if you HSV and feel like you shouldn’t disclose because it’s “mild” when would “you” disclose that you have a STI/transferable illness? - HSV is thankfully usually mild and honestly most people have some strain of it. (Cold sores for example are a strain of HSV-1) However, regardless if it’s transmittable it’s best to be honest. You don’t want that on your conscience that you knowingly gave someone a permanent disease. ### I mean, did she have the same misconceptions? A lot of people who get cold sores don’t know it’s herpes and how it spreads. ### I've been living with it for years now. Problem is at first I was able to deal with it. Hsv1 dormant in your system. Out if sight out of mind. Even then I didn't attempt anything with a woman. Just doesn't seem fair to me and the rejection I fear worse. But recently in the past year I've had out breaks and I'm not adjusting well. ### In how many months? Are you on valtrex? ### yep. if you never talked about testing you cant expect someone else to protect you. people have different morals AKA some people are ""assholes"" ### Yes and I don't believe Eldr is arguing against that. Their comment is talking about the importance of disclosing ### No, she has proudly had herpes since she was a child since her mom had it (just through general contact over years with her mom since you know, family). ### Sorry to hear that. Is is ghsv1 or oral? ### Yes almost 3 ### I see ### Ghsv1 ### Then you're still very much in the early days. There's lots of posts on westover heights clinic forum to support that it takes a few months for the body to get used to the virus, but after 1 year ghsv1 tends to be much less severe or frequent in terms of outbreaks and shedding. Don't worry ### Have you done research into it? Having hsv1 would mean that there is a huge chance that a lot of the women you sleep with already have hsv1 in their system (cold sores) and are at no risk of contracting it from you. Secondly, ghsv1 tends to have much milder outbreaks and less frequent than ghsv2. Transmission of ghsv1 to the genitals of a partner is also extremely unlikely- Terri Warren has never seen such a transmission in 35 years. The vast majority of ghsv1 is caused by someone with a cold sore performing oral sex. Shedding is also amongst the lowest, so risk of transmission is also lower. If you combine all that with antivirals and condom use, you really have no reason to avoid sex out of fear of transmitting to a partner. ### A year of this 😭 ### No not a a full year, the first months are usually the worst.

No you won’t get ob’s on your mouth dude ### Oral sex, condoms are rarely used during oral sex if we're honest here and one of those two or if not both people had ohsv1 and passed it onto you gentially and now you have ghsv1, they don't need have a visible cold sore to pass on the virus. . .

tl8v50,"Balanthis and HSV2 I tested positive but literally have no other symptoms but balanthis  (swollen head) anyone else have this?

The only other people that had this seemed to think it was fungal on top of HSV2",29,2022-03-23 15:17:09-04:00,"How are you diagnosed ### Yep this has been my issue since November.  Including the ass crack being on fire.  Patiently waiting for shit to calm down.  First year is always the worst.  Do antivirals help? ### I believe its fairly common for outbreaks to end up triggering balanitis. So you could develop a sore caused by hsv, which then leads to fungal/bacterial growth. If you do have balanitis, you may well have fungal infection across the boxer area. Hsv typically should resolve in a week to 2 weeks. Occasionally a severe outbreak may take a month. An untreated fungal infection however could persist for months. ### Swollen head? Nothing else? ### Wtf dude similar here
I don’t get any sores/lesions
The head of my penis hurts so much around the edges constantly. I’m cut and hygienic so struggle to see how it could be fungal.
My balls are red and the skin is scaly! 
Anti virals do not do anything to stop this. Tried taking them and tried not taking them has zero difference. 
Wtfff ### IGG test.. 2.2 reading ### The balanthis? ### Well its been a month and anti fungals dont help.... maybe antivirals and anti fungals? I just started anti virals ### Virus in the skin can't  cause the cracks and swelling on the head of the penis? ### Cracked skin too and pain in my ass dick and balls ### Yep im cut too... maybe auto immune? ### Did you ever test positive for herpes? ### Seems pretty low. 
Could be a false positive. Especially if you haven’t had any other symptoms. ### Similar pain, burning, and redness on penis tip. I am 10 weeks following possible exposure from an inanimate object (yes, maybe a first) and tested negative IGG at 6 weeks. testing again tomorrow, 10 weeks. 

  
At what point did you test 2.2? Do you have a potential exposure date known? ### Yes since that’s your only symptom. I’m curious if the antivirals had any effect on it.  

A lot of us guys that are dealing with this penis head problem aren’t clear whether it’s the herpes, an immune inflammatory reaction, or fungal overgrowth. 

But none of the treatments seem to make any difference for any of us. And Valtrex made no difference for me with this one issue. ### Which antifungal? Balanitis can be either bacterial or fungal. If bacterial antifungal won't work, if fungal you need to be applying OTC cream twice a day. Don't use soap. If otc antifungal cream doesn't work you'll need stronger stuff from the doctor. Fungal infections can take over a month to clear in some cases. What did the Dr say? ### Herpes can cause sores on the penis but cracked skin isn't typically a symptom ### No, have never got bloods done just a negative swab on the only lesion I had on my shaft ### My ass and dick and testicles always  feel like they are on fire.. and it hurts to pee ### Ive been banging randos for years.. look at this

Quest Diagnostics, is 1.1. A 2005 study published in the journal BioMed Central Infectious Disease found that index values above 3.5 yielded over 90 percent accuracy — but scores between 1.1 and 3.5 had around a 50 percent chance of being wrong.

My whole head is swollen though especially the edges ### Well i got aclyovir cream so im gonna try to put it on directly. I just started the anti virals.. ill give it a shot but not too hopeful.

I think its an issue with your penis head microbiome. I swear its these doctors because it started right when i took anti biotics and steroids (lowers  your immune system)+ stressing also lowers it... and either let the fungus run wild or the HSV2 run wild or both. The doctor said my HSV 2 was under the surface under control for years... this technically would be my first breakout. ### I mean ive used the nystatin for a month... they said theres no way to check unless you get a biospy of the penis. Should i just try putting an anti bacterial cream on it? Also i was on doxy cipro azithro and cefamine so should have killed the bacteria. ### I'm so sorry. That really sucks :( I hope you get an answer soon and treatment that works for you. ### Aw, I’m sorry. 
I hope you find some answers soon. ### I don’t know. Mine did not happen in the presence of antibiotics I don’t think.  

To be completely honest, I am leaning more towards the theory that the body is just having an immune inflammatory reaction to a new virus that is agitating the genital region. 

This is why it frustrates me so much when people in this sub tell people that it “can’t possibly be herpes“ if you’ve got weeks and weeks of itching or redness. 

Many people report this. Especially during primary outbreak months.  The assertion that you’re supposed to be 100% normal - get blisters for 7 to 10 days - and then back to 100% normal, just doesn’t match reality. ### Hmmm I was under the impression that you could get a swab but I could have got that wrong. Fungal infection after antibiotics is common, since they can upset your flora in your gut and on your skin. ### Hope so bro... that means we just got hit the HSV 2 and the rest will fade away 🙏🙏🙏.

tkuze3,Does anyone want to chat on the phone about recent diagnosis? I'm feeling really sad and have been kind of depressed the past week. My doctor is going to put me on suppressive therapy for a year because I was getting constant outbreaks the past week and a half. Message me please if you want to get on the phone and chat about things!,3,2022-03-23 10:19:18-04:00,"I know exactly how you feel, I feel like my life is over and I’m grieving it.. ### I like that you’re reaching out like this. There’s literally nothing worse than the several weeks after diagnosis. Where you’re completely fucking alone. 

Literally there’s nothing worse. You can’t go anywhere with your thoughts that gives you relief. And you can’t tell anyone.  I advise that you don’t, even if you think they’re safe to tell. 

Find people who have it and talk to them. So I hope somebody does call you. In fact I hope several people reach out to you and offer to call. Because talking to people is the only thing that helps. Other people that know what it’s like. 

I had one friend who I knew got it several years ago and I called her. She was my angel even though she hates discussing the topic, and wants to never think about it again because she doesn’t really get outbreaks anymore. 

Keep trying to find people to talk to you on the phone. It will help. ### I'm at work right now, but I'd be happy to chat later tonight.

tl3vs7,"HSV-1 on my chin? Hi,

So it was a confusing time. I have a history of perioral dermatitis (POD, dermatitis around the mouth, nasolabial folds and chin) and my chin was super red and burning. I assumed it was POD and used my typical creams and antibiotics for it. It got worse, spread, and started to harden. I went to the dermatologist who said it was HSV-1 that got on my chin. Which I thought was weird. I assumed I had HSV-1 since I used to get cold sores all the time but it was on my chin, not on my mouth. It turned into painful blisters, the whole thing.

After a Valtrex prescription, SuperLysine+, tea tree oil, zinc, hypercolloid bandages, it was gone in two weeks. A week after the initial clearing, my chin is red again. I'm so paranoid it's HSV-1 again. Or it could be POD? I'm back to taking Valtrex 1mg 3x a day and Lysine for prevention. Has anyone ever had it on their face like I did? Just so weird. And awful.",1,2022-03-23 13:54:12-04:00,"Sorry - Valtrex is 1gram, not mg ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tl3vs7/hsv1_on_my_chin/
tkunnj,"OHSV1 transmission never occurred with ex So I've been getting more educated about OHSV1 in the last year. I've had it my whole life but started getting pretty bad outbreaks in 2011 due to stress and lack of sleep. I started dating someone during this time and I was always resistant to them kissing me or doing anything when I had an outbreak. They had never cared and always kissed me and got physical despite me having an outbreak. 

I am still in touch with them and they've told me they have never tested positive for HSV. Could this be a situation where it's dormant or is there another reason? The only person I know I've transmitted it to is my last partner but they have never had an outbreak either, they just tested positive.",0,2022-03-23 10:04:27-04:00,,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tkunnj/ohsv1_transmission_never_occurred_with_ex/
tku4lc,"Nerve Issues I (30F) will preface this by saying I have had HSV for 11 years. Contracted at 19 in a traumatic way. Never was tested for what type it was since the doctor told me it didn’t matter. My husband contracted it from me and he goes years in between outbreaks. I have had outbreaks on my genitals, tailbone, in my nose, and cold sores. I have figured out triggers over the years. Stress, masturbating, and it used to be monthly when I was on birth control. 

While my outbreaks have became less frequent over the years they have not become less severe. I have a week of bad nerve pain prior to an outbreak. Most recently I had extreme sharp back pain that was quite brutal and then a cold sore appeared and it went away. I hadn’t thought the back pain was related until it magically disappeared after a week of suffering when this facial growth showed up.  


Looking to know if other people experience HSV at this level and if anyone takes the daily meds that keep it at bay, if they find that to be successful.

tktw3g,"I think my partner gave me herpes My partner and I started dating 9 months ago. We both got tested via blood and urine for full panels including herpes 1 and 2. Both of us came back negative. I also got myself tested again two months into the relationship, because I slept with someone a month and a half before we started dating and I wanted to be sure. This also came back negative. 
A few weeks ago I noticed bumps on my privates, 3 total. It doesn't hurt to pee and they only tingle on occasion. They haven't gone away and don't seem to have burst. But I've never had bumps like this and I am worried it is herpes. I sent off an hpv test and I also have an appointment tomorrow for a swab for herpes. 

Can I get opinions on this timeline, is it likely he cheated or could it be the test he took when we first dated was too soon to when he slept with others (unsure of when he slept with others)? 

I do think it's odd that it's taken til now for me to have an outbreak if he didn't cheat.. 9 months in..

For some context, before the one time I had sex with another guy (1.5 months before dating this one) I did not have sex for three years and got screened multiple times during this period of no sex, to be safe and also because I do have a fear of stds.

Only ever had one sore during my first outbreak,4,2022-03-23 10:47:17-04:00,"The itching can be because HSV can cause nerve damage/ post herpetic neuralgia, and the itching can be a part of this.

Herpes doesn’t cause nonstop itchiness. ### skin itches as it heals unfortunately, due to skin cell turnover and histamine release. i also agree with the comment earlier regarding post-herpetic neuralgia (zapping, the crawlies, tingling/tickling, or any other nerve related sensation). the damaged and/or affected nerves as a result of the infection will take several months to regenerate and heal. until then, have you tried over the counter claritin or zyrtec for the itching? i also found A&D cream and Desitin ointment to be helpful for the skin as well. ### Thanks so much for sharing.

tksc14,"Casual Contact Activities… Am I Fine or At Risk? Good Morning Everyone!

I hope you’re all doing well. Thank you for the sheer amount of information, love and support that you all provide to strangers that you do not even know.

[updated w/ additional info: my friend left on Tuesday. On Wednesday morning, I woke up with a sore throat that persisted the entire day. On Thursday morning, I woke up with a slightly better sore throat and a slightly more prominent cough and mid/upper back aches. Besides rubbing her back twice and possibly touching the red spots that did not look like blisters, I am confident that I didn’t have any other exposure to her skin long-term that I would categorize as more than you’d get from a coworker.]

In January, my friend was diagnosed with GHSV. I’m not exactly sure if she has Type I or Type II down there, but I’m assuming it’s Type II. Anyway, she is here to visit and she is on her period, something that I know can trigger or cause OBs, or at least asymptomatic shedding, according to what I’ve read here. She takes daily antivirals (not sure exactly which ones, her prescribed dosage or how consistently, but I believe she does take them daily). I just wanted to know how likely transmission is in the below three scenarios. I would never want to make her feel uncomfortable or like our friendship has changed, because honestly, it hasn’t, so I don’t want to ask her and possibly offend her but I would still like to be knowledgeable about things that have stuck out to me and hasn’t left my mind. Considering that it has been less than the 3-4 full months needed for her to form sufficient antibodies and auto-inoculation is higher before this time AND she was on her period so maybe she had increased symptomatic shedding?????):

1. [updated to include] we shared food, and that’s something we’ve always done and I don’t want to say no just because….., but not utensils, so same plate, different forks and spoons. Is this a risk? Could she have somehow passed OHSV2 to me (she’s never mentioned oral symptoms) through this way? She complained of allergies, so maybe her immune system was already low.

2. Earlier in the day, my back was facing her and so I couldn’t see what she was about to do but she adjusted my (low cut, to the point where I had to go without undies) bottom by pulling it up quickly and slightly. To do this, her hand had to go behind the hem of my bottoms and of course, only my skin was there. This area is best describe as the top of my buttcrack/butt. She had used the bathroom earlier/recently and while I trust her to wash her hands thoroughly with soap each time, it’s not like I physically saw it to assume that. How likely would transmission be to this area of my body/me at all from this encounter? I know that the virus can live on hands/fingers if not properly washed and transferred and to healthy skin, it can do no harm but the top of my buttcrack is a different area I’m assuming since it would be considered the start of one of my private areas.


3. I offered to rub cream on my friend’s upper back because she couldn’t reach. She had, in anybody else what I would consider maybe 1-2 small back pimples or non-herpetic red, small spots, but because she has not passed the 3-4 month mark after her initial OB and self (or auto?)- inoculation could happen during this time and I do not know if it did….. How likely is it that those could’ve been herpetic lesions and I could get herpetic whitlow from them? I have INTENSE peeling of my hands from over washing (pandemic + OCD caused). Additionally, how likely would it be for someone else to get it from any virus leftover on my hands if I was holding and caressing this other person’s hand for a good amount of time? This person has new, pink skin over recent cuts and scrapes, but the cuts and scrapes themselves are not new. The scabs have formed and in most, if not all cases, already fallen off and the skin underneath is pink (on it’s way to being fully healed).

I really hope not to offend anybody but like I said, these stuck out to me over the time that she was/is here. Especially now that I have a sore throat, couch and (what really is making me nervous, mid-back aches!!). Thank you for your responses!

TL;DR: Can I get OHSV2 from my friend if we shared food (same plate, different utensils)? She was sick (thought it was allergies but maybe not….) and now my throat is sore and I have a slight cough. She didn’t have any blisters or sores orally.


TL;DR#2: How likely is it for genital herpes to spread from (leftover virus that may be on) one person’s hands to another person if the first person adjusted the waist of the second person’s pants? 

TL;DR #3: How likely is it for genital herpes to cause herpetic whitlow or any other type of infection if Person B rubs Person A’s (with genital herpes) back where there are (could be pimples) small, red spots and has dry, peeling skin from over washing hands in general? How likely is it to cause herpetic whitlow of any other type of infection if Person B holds hands with Person C who has new skin over cuts and scrapes on hand but it is not technically open or fresh?

Again, thank you for your time and if it may seem a little weird, please read the full length of the post for more detail.

Thank you!",16,2022-03-23 08:00:48-04:00,"What what you have described pretty much zero chance of hsv, but sever ocd anxiety. 

Transmission if she is shedding (which you don’t know) or OB which is not apparent from your post is skin to skin. Ie her skin where the infection is present , you said genitals to your skin. Her genitals need to make contact with your genitals or oral area or if it’s your hands likely where you have some open cut / abrasion. Not her back that you rubbed. Even if she had some viral load on her hands it’s a fragile viral that doesn’t live long off of infected area. And she would have to have a sufficient viral load to spread from an area where she is not infected.

Ghsv can easily be 1 or 2.  Ghsv1 has become more common due to ohsv1 positive people performing oral sex on hsv1 negative people. ### I completely understand your concerns because for the longest time, my OCD was absolutely debilitating and I was constantly stressed about catching anything that anyone else has. However, it is important to note that unless you had sex with, kissed, or shared drinks or food while she was having an OB, you’re very unlikely to contract herpes. I understand how stressful your situation may be to you right now, but take a deep breath and remind yourself how herpes is transmitted. You’ll be completely fine :). But if you start getting a rash that you think could be herpes, go see your provider and they can give you professional help. From my standpoint though, you are just very stressed out and you should be absolutely fine :). ### No risk. Stop worrying. ### If you check out expert Terri Warrens herpes handbook , she will reiterate the skin to skin transmission.  So things like sharing food , drinks and almost all inanimate objects or indirect contact ie she touches something then touches you are just not the way you will get hsv. Only item of concern lipstick / chapstick. 

And a person isn’t contagious 24/7. Only during OB and viral shedding & you need a minimum viral load to get infected. 

Sore throats and coughs are rampant right now , omicron still making the rounds ### Hi!

Thank you for your reply. I definitely did not have any contact with her genitals, but I think that because she is on daily antivirals and ‘hasn’t had any issues since the first time’ (her words) that she might not be as careful. For example, I saw her removing her tampon because she had the door open and then she closed it with her bare hands.

I do have OCD, and I do have anxiety. And I’m trying to balance that without being disrespectful or offensive, so thank you.

I’m also worried about the sore throat and cough because of posts/anecdotes like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/gbzo4e/so_im_really_worried_about_my_throat/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) (referring to the comments). ### Hi!

Thank you for understanding. I do have anxiety/OCD and the last thing I want is to come off offensive or disrespectful. We did share food (she used her fork to taste my food a few times here and there) but her outbreak was genital and not oral, but I can’t be sure that I didn’t catch anything from her that way.

I’m also worried about the sore throat/coughing systems because of anecdotes (the comments) like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/gbzo4e/so_im_really_worried_about_my_throat/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf). I’m not exactly sure if she performed oral and possibly got OHSV2 and I now am unsure if I could’ve gotten that from sharing food (albeit, different forks) this past week.

Thank you for your reply! ### Thank you! ### Thank you! I COVID in mid/late January, so I doubt I could get it again so soon, but I’ll test. ### You know how many people you could have shook hands with or partied with that had HSV2? 

Unless you had sex with her, you're fine. ### Of course! It’s completely reasonable to be stressed about it, especially after sharing food. But if she did not have an active outbreak in her mouth I am almost 100% positive that you’ll be completely fine. Take a deep breath and monitor yourself for any symptoms like sores in your mouth mainly. It’s highly unlikely that you caught it so I think the best thing for you right now would be to reach out to any therapist/counselor/support system you have and just take some self care time to help yourself calm down a bit. I know things like this can be scary but you’re most likely completely fine. I hope you feel better soon and let me know if you need to talk about anything related to this! 

Have a great rest of your day! :) ### I didn’t mean to push you down the covid test route , just wanted to say lots of people ill wiht lots of things ### Thank you! I guess the sore throat, cough and mid/upper back aches have me extra concerned. I keep seeing back aches are almost only flu/flu-like but none of my other symptoms seem to be flu like. ### Thank you so much and please have an amazing, amazing day yourself! ### No, you didn’t because I definitely was going to check regardless. Thankfully, it’s negative! My upper back and neck are sort of aching, but I can’t really remember if that’s normal with regular colds at this point. Thank you for your reply! ### I know what you mean , a little cold & test positive and we are freaking out. Pain , fever & verge of death and negative and we are like phew all good .  Take care and don’t worry as much. ### Thank you! Have an awesome day! ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tksc14/casual_contact_activities_am_i_fine_or_at_risk/

tl0iuo,"Herpes :( My girlfriend gave me oral herpes. I am just shocked and I have no idea what should I do.

She became sick and this shit appeared on her face. It was already a scab/scar. I asked what is that and she told me that nothing important, just some cold sore (I have never heared this word before), and it is already healed - so nothing to be worried about. I had some common sense and didn't kiss her for the next week . of course I got herpies one month after, I didn't kiss her, maybe we should have waited a bit longer, maybe I get them even earlier, maybe she gave me a cup that she used before dunno

she has naver told me before that she has herpies. When I became infected, she told me that she had cold sores once in primary/secondary school and she was young back then and had no idea what was that. Her mother has this shit regullary so I guess she knows :/

We are together for 5 months, and she has never mentioned and she has oral herpes

I don't know what to think, for me it just sounds ridiculous. She said it is not that is not a big deal and I don't have to worry about it. It seems for me so selfish or extreamly irresposible and stupid to spread fucking herpes on someone's face

I am worried as fuck. I cannot get rid of this virus and also cannot break up, I am not going to find another girl with this shit on my mouth and I don't want to spread this shit on someone else

I don't know what to do, she is a nice girl who do really care, maybe I am just overreacting? But from my point of view it was completely irresponsible

Give me some advice, what would you do if you were in my place?",37,2022-03-23 12:45:38-04:00,"She did tell you . Cold sores are herpes ### She didn’t know she had herpes, it’s not exactly on her. You’re still deciding to stay with her. Chill the fuck out. #respectfully 
If it’s really that unbearable, end things with her and go get tested. Like Damn. ### Most people have herpes, if you had cold sores before thats herpes. I wish people would learn that and it was less stigmatized, you’d probably would feel a hell of a lot better. I don’t think she knew honestly, I don’t know her but based on her response it seems like a shock to her too. I think you’re not overreacting, any reaction is valid, but I think you overall need to do research and breathe. Doctors don’t even tell people what cold sores are. She told you what she knew. Talk to her, calmly and like an adult. Also chill out with saying people are just “willingly spreading it” especially here. We do nothing but try to build a understanding community. We want to help. So don’t be rude to us. We want the best for you. ### I think she's used to having herpes and we all will get used to it eventually, but she should have let you know. Not even doctors will alert you if you have hsv type one, My friends have experienced this several times. They consider it a widespread non-issue. 

But you are right that she should have told you before kissing. Consent includes knowing status. ### I contracted oral herpes a few years ago. Like you, I was really angry and hopeless. I thought my life was over and I’d never find love or be able to have sex. I literally wanted to kill myself.

Now, I forget I have it. Most people with oral herpes get very few outbreaks. Nobody I’ve dated has ever cared and I am in a very happy relationship. From the sounds of it, you and your gf weren’t educated enough on cold sores. This sucks, but I don’t know that your girlfriend meant any harm. Just always remember to stay educated about stuff. ### When I was diagnosed with oral herpes, my doctor told me most people do have it. They may not have sores often or even ever. I was told it was a strain of the same virus that causes chicken pox. I was also told I wasn’t contagious unless had an open sore. That isn’t true. Since I hadn’t been kissing anyone for months, I didn’t know how I got it. I was the girl teased for being a prude. I felt my life was over. I’d never date, marry…. All not true. Your girlfriend may not have all of the facts.  It may not be that she was hiding it from you. ### Most people don't know that cold sores are HSV 1 and/or 2. You are a whole human being worth all the love and time. You'll be okay. This is a good support group. If you do break up it's okay, it's possible to still find someone (though it doesn't feel like that right now). You can take anti virals and up your water intake. Figure out your stressors or cues that induce an outbreak and try to avoid them as best as possible. You are loved and cherished for you. ### I remember all sorts of kids in school getting cold
sores when we were kids. We all thought it was just like a canker sore, from too much acidic food, or opening their mouth too wide to try to fit their fist in it. NEVER was the word “herpes” used. I don’t think I figured out that’s what cold sores are until I was 40. I truly don’t think your gf was trying to deceive you. And you’re going to be OK. I promise. ### I understand why he’s upset tbh guys ### Not the end of the world, you’ll be fine! There are much much worse illnesses in the world. ### Honestly she told you, she could have disclosed better and maybe that will be a lesson for her, to be more educated and cautious about spreading to people in the future. You mentioned you abstained from kissing her for a week but still contracted, so you knew it was contagious but after you learned the correct medical term you are really throwing it out of proportion. In all honesty, you kind of seem like you resent her a lot for it, I understand your frustration, and spiraling is totally normal  but if that's the case, then you should move on and let her find someone else who is less condensending. I don't think you'll move on happily with this person if you resent them so much and are angry at them. I know I couldn't be with the person I contracted it from, only it was Ghsv2 and so much more stigmatized then Ohsv1. ### Not everyone does. You don't get them if you don't have herpes. Just because it's so common doesn't mean everyone has it or will get it. ### At least you didn’t get genital herpes from her ### To be honest, I understand her. I contracted GHSV1 recently and that's how I came to look up this page. Before that I had always assumed it had oral hsv1 cause I vaguely recall having what I thought was a cold sore when I was a child, but I guess wasn't one. 

I never thought about it. It's been so long and herpes just slipped my mind completely. Even if I had remembered, I think I wouldn't have thought much of it cause it's more common to have oral herpes than isn't.

If I had been diagnosed with OHSV1 I don't think I would have ended up here. I think I would have thought oh yeah that thing everyone has, and moved on.

Since getting ghsv1, I've told some people I know, and a lot have been like oh that's not a big deal though, I have Ohsv1 and legit never think about it. It's just incredibly normal.

I'm sorry that you're dealing with it and that you are upset she didn't tell you. I'm sorry that you're finding this difficult. I don't think she failed to tell you out of a desire to be dishonest or hide something she thought you should know. ### Everyone gets cold sores. Don’t flip. If you like the girl, stay with her. If this is the last straw, move on. But you’ll find that a lot of people have the virus and it’s no biggie. Carry on :) ### yes after 5months of realtionship, awesome ### perhaps, but somehow I am feeling betrayed, maybe I am still just a kid ### I feel the same way, exactly the same. I'm completely tired of this shit, I hope it will get a little better soon

she didn't want to harm me, but maybe if she had some basic knowledge about this shit I would have avoid this situation. I am not a doctor to be able to recognize every disease ### I had absolutely no idea. All my life is stress and studying till late hours. I only needed herpes on my face. ehhhh I hate life ### yes, but i read that hsv1 can spread to other parts of my body. I don't what to have this shit on my genitals or eyes. now I have to be careful until the end of my life ### None of my friends have them so it doesn't seem so common. Even if you mention herpes everyone feels disgusted, so it is definitely not normal

she should have dated a doctor then ### She told you and you still chose to be with her . But honestly relax it’s not that deep . It’s not a death sentence. Also get on valtrex it helps . I get you’re upset but …yes your overreacting. ### I'm honestly so sorry about this. But it is totally OK to be scared, sad. ### Yeah, I still hate the person who gave it to me — though she was more malicious as a person in general, and definitely knew enough about herpes and cold sores to have used some common fucking sense.

But in the grand scheme of things, you will likely be fine <3 After a while, you probably won’t really care about herpes or really think about it when you don’t actively have one. I’m sorry it is making you feel so awful, though. ### Lol Im in professional school and lol I hear you. These next two weeks are killing me. But we make due, ya know? ### That's not true. Once you get it one area, its rare to get it in another. After you build antibodies from having it for a while it's not even possible I believe. Just be careful during your initial outbreak not to touch the sores and then other areas without washing your hands. 

Those who have one type in multiple areas usually will have contracted them at the same time. ### It is in fact more common to have it than not, people just don't get tested for it so they don't know. You seem really hostile about this, and while I understand it's annoying it could end up not being a big deal in your life. Outbreaks can be a pain but you might have to deal with few if any at all.

It doesn't have to be what you are making it. ### she told me after 5 months of relationship and one month after I got them. i didn't make any decison.  she told me that there is nothing to be worry about so I stayed completely chill because I was not expecting that it is contagious.

I am overreacting? so are you just another girl spreading herpes? ### This is wrong . Regardless of how we feel about HSV people still have the right to chose what they want for their health. Herpes affects everyone differently so just because it’s not a “big deal “ in your life doesn’t mean it can’t take a toll on someone else’s . Just because she had 1 outbreak her whole life doesn’t me he’s gonna get only one. It was very manipulative of her to wait 5months into the relationship before disclosing and ontop of that to misinform her partner and say “it’s no big deal” when having an active outbreak…. Not fair . I’mHSV+ to btw ### thx for some kind words, stay strong ### seems logical, I hope it is true ### Kmsl wow . Again calm down .Yes you are overreacting definitely. Cold sores are nothing to worry about . What do you want from us? To be upset and cry with you because you have herpes ? Newsflash WE ALL HAVE IT and it’s not a big deal.  Now if you feel betrayed and heartbroken okay i understand . But no I’m not going to tell you herpes is the worst because it’s not . And also no i dont go around spreading herpes i tell my partner and it’s not a big deal . ### Him being upset over her lying is fine . But herpes is not a big deal . Why would i tell him . Your life is over ! This pain will be unbearable? You should do this or that ?! No ..I’m not . He does need to calm down . I never got the whole” let’s make them feel worse and make them scared” thing . I gave him advice on taking meds and to calm down . It’s not a lot to say right now but frankly the best thing he needs to do is to get on meds and not freak out . ### Same! ### I understand where you're coming from, but not everyone has this, and I'd definitely prefer to not have gotten this. I've had some gnarly outbreaks and not had access to medication, and it sucks. ### None of us woke up and said “ yes id like a side of herpes with a extra side of outbreak “ . But we have it and it’s here permanently. Anything technically can be a big deal but my advice is to not let this ruin you . Take your medicine. Valtrex on Rx is 15 bucks . Once you take your medicine your outbreak will stop . After you do that i would suggest counseling. But you need to calm down . Being upset and hurt won’t solve anything . Doing something for your outbreak and pain will . ### ",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tl0iuo/herpes/
tkqchr,"Advice needed desperately A few years ago I (25f) was seeing this really amazing woman (34f) who lives in a different city to me. We would travel to each other every few weeks and spend the weekend. I liked her a lot, but I was young and couldn’t offer her the commitment she wanted back then. So she got into a relationship with someone else and we fell out of contact for a few years. During this time is when I got herpes (gHSV1).

Anyway, her and her ex broke up recently and she slid in my DM’s again, asking if I want to come visit her. I cant think of anything I want more, but I haven’t replied yet because I know I need to disclose now and I don’t even know how to begin doing it. This will be my very first disclosure, and while I’m not someone who’s been extremely devastated by my diagnosis, I can still understand that someone may not want to expose themselves to that and reject me. Also I haven’t yet had to consider disclosing to someone I actually really like.

If you check out the ""Herpes Research Cure"" subreddit, you'll see that there are currently many big companies in the process of creating a therapeutic vaccine.

By encouraging people to donate to these companies, we will get a cure faster. By pretending that herpes is just a ""skin rash"", we're essentially saying, we're okay without a cure.

I have a relative who's been waiting on a cure (and donating tons of personal finances) for over a decade, and hasn't reached a good place with their status at all. I might talk about it at some point but I'm also not as versed in the science/tech, and think there are more science-minded advocates out there who could probably do more. Again though, because it could take years, \*and\* does rest on the notion that herpes is really serious and debilitating, I don't want to overfocus on that. While I 100% think they need to develop a treatment and am totally behind it, I'm not going to paint a picture of herpes the stigma already has, you know? Just my personal stance. Not saying that won't change. ### Thank you so much! Appreciate you <3 ### I understand where you're coming from. However,  in 2022, a cure is a definite possibility if not a guarantee.

Learn how to take care of yourself. There are all kinds of ways - there are counselors who help with that, classes, etc. Ask your doctor for referrals. Look for a life skills center near you. Is there an aunt or something you can ask them to help? 

You can do this. 💖 ### Deep breaths love, you'll be ok! I felt the exact same way, I self isolated myself and became depressed because I thought I would be alone forever. I got my diagnosis after I got back in the dating game from my divorce. So I was a divorced, single mom to a small child with behavior issues and now THIS!?! I hit rock bottom, hard! I pushed everyone away, I rejected all date invitations because it's easier to play hard to get than having to be really vulnerable with someone again.  After a while, I started to focus on learning to love myself again and discovering who I was and what made me happy. I realized I am MORE than my diagnosis and deserving of love. I'm also a Christian so I relied on my faith a lot during this time. I know that God has a plan for me and nothing, NOTHING will derail that. Fast forward two years and I am in the healthiest relationship of my life! I spent time getting to know my partner before we got physical, we fell in love with each others personality before our bodies ever touched. He knew about my relationship issues in the past and I was honest with him about how I contracted the disease (I was given it on purpose out of revenge) and he was understanding. He asked questions and did his own research and because we had taken the time to get to know each other first, he knew who I REALLY was and didn't see me as just a disease. He saw how common it was and knew I was the person he wanted to be with, so he made the conscious decision on his own to be ""all in"". 

I know that everyone has their own story when it comes to this type of thing, but just know that you are NOT ALONE in your feelings. Focus on yourself and eventually you will bump into the right person and they will fit into your life so easily you won't have to try at all. ### You have two relationships under your belt post-diagnosis, what’s stopping you from having another?

I get it, it’s hard to get out of the negative feedback loop. But you are only defeating yourself here. Might you get rejected? Sure, but you could also get rejected even without having herpes. It doesn’t make rejection any easier or harder. It’s all about your relationship with yourself. Love yourself, and other people will love you regardless of herpes. Plain and simple. ### Thank you for your response. I appreciate it and I am going to try to take care of myself physically & mentally. ### Thank you for your response.

tkeblf,"Just diagnosed: In shock and feeling guilty My fiancé and i were having threesomes with this woman for about a month. When she left town, she called us and expressed that she was having the worst pain in her genitals, with blisters, along with a sore throat and fever (I later learned this would be considered her first OB). I immediately got a blood panel, and while waiting for results thought back to if I could potentially have it and not have known. For years I have had ""recurring UTIs"" After reading up on how an OB can be mistaken for UTI symptoms, I knew that the test would come back positive, as it did. 

&#x200B;

My fiancé has accepted it, but I am having the hardest time, and can't get over the ""who, what, when and how's"". At the age of 25, I think I've had it since my sophomore or junior year of college. I will never know if I passed it along to anyone, or who passed it to me. I feel guilty for passing it to the young woman. I'm relieved that I know what is, but a bit envious of those who will probably never get blood work, and will never know they have it. ignorance is absolute bliss. The envy is only there, because I feel really alone right now. I want someone to feel what I am feeling.

&#x200B;

This is absolute ramblings of my initial shock, but I hope I can move forward soon. Wallowing in my sadness will probably elevate my symptoms. I guess the first stage is acceptance, and the next stage is figuring out what triggers an OB for me. If I thought it was recurring UTIs all this time, I'm sure my sores are in my Urethra.

tkmrvj,"Is it important to disclose your status as an HSV1+ person? So I have oral herpes type 1. I have a question about when I should disclose and Ill give some background before asking.

I got it as a kid. I don’t even remember how. Probably shared a water cup with an adult who had it. I had some outbreaks back then but I haven’t had an outbreak since, in maybe 15 years, not even when I was extremely stressed or in very harsh and dry weather. Yet my blood test still and forever will come back positive.

Ever since I got diagnosed at age 18 or 19 (before I didn’t know cold sores were herpes), I’ve disclosed it to every person I’ve dated. They’ve always been okay with it or even told me I didn’t have to tell them. And actually none of them have gotten it, and they’ve been multiple year long relationships. So I think the chances I give it to someone are extremely low, I mean despite kissing these girls for years, they never contracted it.

Should I disclose my status to hookups (like one time things)? Should I even disclose it to potential long term partners before kissing for the first time? I think with the latter I should, but I don’t know if I should with the former. I feel like disclosing it would kill any chance of something happening. And oral herpes is SOOO normal and common that it almost feels stupid… but I don’t want to be an ass, or even worst, infect them…

PD: I know I’m lucky. I got it as a kid, and orally, which means I’m very unlikely to get the genital one. I know some of you go through a lot more and my question might feel stupid or even insulting. I’m sorry if that’s the case.

But anyways....I think the whole expectation on people who know they have herpes is very unfair and doesn't do much besides make us less fuckable. It's also the fact that no one else is doing it but we are expected to because we happen to be educated. I've had 10+ sex partners of both genders and I know for a fact at least one of them had herpes but I was never disclosed to and honestly I don't think I should've been. I never asked if they had herpes so they weren't being dishonest to me even if they knew. Also statistically speaking 80-90% of people with genital herpes have no idea they have it so they are definitey not disclosing that they have it. The CDC doesn't even think it should be disclosed to the vast majority of people with herpes because they do not recommend testing for it unless there is an outbreak. Also nobody asks me ""hey have you ever had any STDs?"" I am the one who has to make that conversation and freak someone out who was seconds ago blissfully unaware that they could get an STD. And then I have to spend time correcting their ignorance. Someone thought I exposed them because we were cuddling with pants on. It's exhausting sometimes.

tkhuhe,"Is Western Blot ineffective if someone hasn't seroconverted enough antibodies yet? I've seen posts about people testing positive 5, 6, 7 months later. I understand it is rare for someone to seroconvert later than 12 weeks for an IgG test with it having 92% HSV2 accuracy and 70% HSV1 accuracy. I understand it's also rare for the Western Blot to miss infections past 12 weeks 99%/95%. I have, however, found a few posts on here where individuals have eventually tested positive months later (past the 12 week mark), rarely even after a Western Blot.

I have some questions that I hope to try and figure out some important distinctions.

**My questions are:**

1. Is the reasoning for these false negative tests (IgG or WB) at the 12 week mark, which later end up positive, the resulf of them just taking longer than the usual individual to seroconvert?
2. Would the Western Blot's main purpose be the following:
   1. Proving false-positive IGG's
   2. Catching HSV2 & HSV1 infections missed by the IgG 8%/30%.
3. Would the Western Blot be ineffective at picking up infections if someone has not yet seroconverted? From what I understand it is still a type of IgG test that looks for antibodies, it's just done manually and looks for a specific number of ""bands"".",6,2022-03-22 20:47:37-04:00,"I have read those same accounts stating they tested positive 6,8,10 months later. I am currently at 2 weeks and already bought my western blot to take at twelve weeks. This is a great question as I was hoping a negative 12 week blot would be definitive and I could feel safe not to transmit to loved ones.

 I am curious if maybe these people who say they tested positive 6-12 months later maybe had more another encounter in that time frame? These are great questions and hope to get to read some good answers. ### 1. i have read terri warren say on her site that in like 0.1% or people it can take a year to test positive on the western blot (can’t remember the exact % but i think it was something like that)
2. yes just a “better” test than the igg.
3. if someone has not seroconverted yet, i do not believe it would pick it up ### Yes I think it shouldn’t be dismissed if a patient has symptoms (albeit atypical even), is immunocompromised, and has a positive IgM. I think common sense comes into play vs “ignore the IgM” when there are other factors at play. ### 0.1% for a year, but I wonder what the percentage is for 3 months. There is a lot of talk of ""If you test negative after 12 weeks it won't change. The tests won't pick it up"". But that doesn't seem to be the case.

I guess I'm trying to figure out: Does the 92%/70% and the 99%/95% accuracy take into consideration slow seroconversion, or just infections that never get detected. I'm sure that's hard or near impossible to distinguish between because these are studies that are done within a specific time period. ### oh i see what you’re saying! i think that is really hard to test but in my opinion i would say it’s both. i would assume there are rare cases where some people will never test positive on the western blot but i assume it’s extremely rare

I get cold sores on my mouth and take acyclovir pills to stop the cold sore from progressing. This usually stops the cold sore completely so the skin remains normal or significantly minimizes it so the skin heals in less than a week.

I would imagine that between the stress of the pandemic, getting COVID and/or getting a vaccine (which let's be honest, the possible majority of adults haven't had any sort of vaccine since they were kids), a lot of people's immune function decreased enough for their HSV that had been camping out quietly in their nerve endings to finally have an opportunity to show up.

This is a new partner of mine so we are still building trust. You have a good point, my past partners never asked and trusted me to tell them.

tkdqd0,"Does anyone know what a herpes sore looks like before it becomes a blister ? 11 days ago I was with a new partner. He fingered me and there was very brief genital contact (like seconds). Yesterday afternoon/evening I found a bump in my groin area after feeling a little bit sore in that spot and going to check it out. 

It’s on the area where my pubic hair grows.  on the side of my vagina but near the top. close to where underwear would sit in the groin. I’m now worried it’s a herpes lesion but it’s not a blister. It is a flattish hard bump (not soft like google says herpes is). I’m not sure if it’s just a bigger hair follicle bump or if herpes develops into a blister after being a hard bump?

tkh8jl,I received oral from a woman who later told me she had oral hsv2 what are chances i contracted it on my genitals from her mouth? ,6,2022-03-22 20:16:20-04:00,"Almost zero. Oral HSV-2 rarely sheds. It's the least active strain/location combo. ### We don’t have stats on that. For genital-to-genital transmission it’s 4%-10%/year with an infected partner who abstains during outbreaks. But, could you trust a partner who hid an STI from you? Most likely you’re clean, but get tested soon. ### Well that makes me feel better i have no symptoms but i heard most people never do. She didnt have a outbreak at least not from what i saw not sure if she had any inside her mouth. Wish i could test but its only been one month. ### i did get tested sadly its to soon only been 3 weeks need to wait 4 months. ### Yeah dude, definitely don't worry. But take the opportunity to educate yourself while it's on your mind -- HSV-2 is way more common than you might think and a very low proportion of people who have it actually know that they have it. You're way more likely to contract it from someone else who doesn't know their status than from her.

Same with HSV-1, which is extremely common orally and can transmit to genitals (causing GHSV-1) -- not common outside of an outbreak, but also happens all the time. Most sexually active individuals are immune to GHSV-1, though, because they already have HSV-1. I got unlucky there myself, though!

I think most people who are sexually active understand those risks on some level, but don't understand how likely it really is to contract during your lifetime because no one talks about it (partly because most don't know if they've already gotten it). If it's something you're very worried about, you can take steps to reduce or accept the risk (like seeing if you/your partners are already positive for either strain, then deciding if you want to use protection/antivirals, etc.). Transmission is always unlikely outside of an outbreak, but that does tend to be how it happens, when it does. ### You’re fine. Oral HSV2 is very inactive. Even if she’s the first person to tell you she has herpes, take the number of people youve slept with and divide by 3, that’s statistically how many times you’ve had an hsv+ partner. ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tkh8jl/i_received_oral_from_a_woman_who_later_told_me/

tjrr9n,"I don’t think it’s worth knowing. I think we should all consider why the CDC recommends not testing if you don’t have very visible symptoms. 

I personally am not entirely sure if I have it or not. And it’s been definitely destroying my state of mind. I can either find out for sure. End up having it. And risk the chance of falling into a deeper depression and taking my life if it gets that dark. 

Or I can treat live life like it was 100 years ago. and not hyper focus on every little body ailment. We live in a time where we can get on our little internet devices and hyper focus to such an unhealthy degree on potential health issues. I’ve probably spent 20+ hours in the last 2 months reading endlessly. The same damn posts over and over again. For what ?!!!   A virus that 80-90% of people are asymptomatic with. 

I barely have sex. But if I find my self really liking someone. And I end up giving it to them. Well then I guess we’re meant to be at that point. But fuck. I can’t live my life hyper focusing. I want to be more carefree. And not treat my life like I live in a fuckin plastic bubble. And share my every little health record with everyone I meet. 

A lot of you make no progress in feeling better because Reddit and the internet becomes a stupid echo chamber of self pity. Im so fucking done with it. Many of us live in a time and place where life is too fucking comfortable. And it gives us way too much opportunity to be emotionally weak. And obsessed with dumb shit like this. 

Reddit is full of people like this. I’m so tired of it.
This is what happens when a society hyper focused on safety and security. People go fucking crazy. And the biggest threat to their safety is their own damn mind.  And this is why the cdc says to just not even test for it. It does more harm than good. 

I want nothing to do with it. I’m going to learn to have fun again. 


So I’d rather not know. I’m taking the CDCs guidelines. They are the authority on this.",109,2022-03-21 21:39:08-04:00,"I agree with you.  I would rather not know.  And if i go the next 30 years with nothing of note, then perfect.  

If I end up with monthly outbreaks, it’ll be pretty obvious that I have it without a test.  

But do I want to dive into a pool of despair and self-hatred at the 3 month mark from a bunch of nonspecific symptoms?  

No. ### I think what’s interesting about your thoughts regarding herpes is that society generally agrees with this notion. Hear me out for a sec.. 
let’s think about what it truly takes to avoid getting herpes (any type). 

You have to be lucky enough to be born to loving parents who don’t have herpes themselves. As you grow up you have to be lucky enough no one you interact with physically in your family/friends circle has herpes. If this works out, you get to your teen years without herpes exposure. 

Now you’re starting to get interested in sex so you are looking to date. You were fortunate that your parents or family circle have educated you so you know to request a full panel STD test at the start of talking to a romantic interest and do a follow up 12-16 weeks after to give you a high probability your romantic interest doesn’t have any STDs. During the 12-16 week wait between tests, you avoid any physical contact or kissing and you keep tabs on your romantic interest to ensure they haven’t been involved with anyone else physically or intimately. 

Once you verified they are “safe”, you feel confident and the relationship expands to include physical intimacy. You possibly use condoms for birth control but enjoy an STD free sex life. 

But in order to remain STD free, you keep tabs on your romantic interest in the hopes there is no cheating or physical contact (herpes gladiatorum/herpetic whitlow anyone?) with others during the relationship. 

As with any relationship, it may or may not work out long term. If it works out.. great you marry your high school or college sweetheart (depending on when you decide to get into a sexual relationship) and stay together forever only having sex and physical contact with each other. If not.. you remain diligent and you repeat the testing criteria and precautions you implemented earlier as well as the “continuous tracking” of romantic interests in order to avoid herpes as well as other STDs. 

Does this sound like anything that occurs in modern dating? 

Exactly, it’s so mechanical, no spontaneity, no trust, persistent paranoia and possible anxiety. 

Sure there are reasonable precautions you can take to avoid STDs in general but herpes is a tougher one to avoid. Given all the ways it can transmit besides intimate contact, how free-spirited and spontaneous modern dating is, condoms not being as effective against the skin to skin  nature of spread vs. the fluid based STIs, many ppl not getting tested and herpes ability to transmit asymptotically.  

Society needs to just accept herpes is a reasonable risk in finding love, sex, relationships and stop vilifying it. Without that change, then ppl are inadvertently agreeing with your stance of “it’s better not knowing” based on the current stigma. ### The thing is we don't deliberate this way over oral herpes, but as soon as it's genital it's a different story — the double standard is frustrating. No one's testing themselves to see if they carry HSV1 or 2 in reference to oral flareups (""coldsores"") and rarely disclose if they do. Yet we have this dark, depressing cloud over it being genital or anywhere else. We should have the same mentality for both, whether it's having the same level of care and due diligence for both, or shrugging both off. ### # CORRECT ### It all boils down to really loving yourself regardless of your condition. I still think everyone should get a full panel testing , just to be safe. Most ppl don’t have safe sex , so it’s for your benefit and others. ### You’re so right. I’m praying I can get to that mindset too ### It’s personally destroyed my life with 2-3 week breakouts all over that hurt SO bad. I can barely function. Then I’m good for maybe a week and it happens again…. Over and over…. I wouldn’t wish this on anyone. And I certainly wouldn’t want to pass this on. Especially since I got it through someone cheating on me. I have a brain tumors, ovarian tumors, cervical cancer, epilepsy, icu with covid and double lung pneumonia, and for me, herpes takes the cake. It’s hard to wake up anymore. ### It's worth knowing so you can take steps to prevent spreading it to others. ### I would have loved to not know… until I accidentally passed it to someone I couldn’t live with myself after that ### I 100% think it's worth knowing. I gave it to someone and was completely asymptomatic for however long I've had it and it has truly caused quite a huge pain for the both of us. If I would have known when I've been tested in the past I could help spread education, do everything in my power to not spread the virus with the daily suppressant and other supplements. You don't know how the other person is going to deal or react. They could be okay with it or they can go into a total breakdown. Knowledge is 100% power and doing anything and everything to try your best to make sure your partner doesn't spontaneously get this can be HUGE for the other person.   


I think a good number of you are thinking, "" I don't get it badly so who cares it's no big deal. "" Some people get this several times a month while others get it once or twice a year. So yeah it can be a no big deal for many but be a little selfless and put yourself in other people's shoes because others might not be as lucky as you and might get really bad/painful OBs. ### I think it's worth knowing. I think people take comfort in not knowing so maybe they feel like they don't have to disclose. I think even though for myself it's just a minor skin problem at this point, it's always best to disclose. ### Come on lets be honest.  CDC is there to sell treatment.  there is no money in cures.  We are just a captive growing population.  100's of thousands of dollars for a lifetime of treatment Vs.  Our suffering and loneliness.  guess who wins.  You got it Big Pharma.  You are depressed we got a pill for that too.  I have never taken medication.  After 5 years I became A Symptomatic .  It has been the better part of 17 years that I have had an outbreak.  Makes you question the meds. ### If you do get symptoms I hope you do get tested and take precautions not to pass it on ### Deleted because while I disagree who am I to rain on your parade. I simply hope myself and no one I care about crosses your path ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ### I get that. I tried to get tested and 2 doctors refused. A third doctor also advised  me to not test but I just wanted to find out so bad cause my ex did get oral cold sores. A part of me realizes now why the doc didn’t want me to know. I hear so many people call people with herpes dirty and I’ve been rejected a lot for something I would have never known I had if I didn’t seek a test. It’s def changed my life. But at the same time, I’m more educated on herpes so that’s the plus that came out of this. 3 years later still no outbreak. But I still just morally disclose to everyone but I hate it! ### I would have appreciated the opportunity to know. Having a breakout has uprooted my life and one of the reasons my partner is leaving. 

Sexual health is an important topic. We can’t come to grips with something we’re not able to measure and understand.

Not a single person has ever disclosed to me. 4 people that I’ve been with did after I had my outbreak. 

It sucks. I get tested every 3 months, on prep, condoms always. Didn’t matter. ### Everybody really needs to give their self a break. Damn near everyone has this shit. Who cares ### 23 years of loneliness, thanks CDC. ### It’s worth knowing.  There are some cases and instances where it can cause major health complications and if you don’t know it’s herpes related you can waste time identifying what the cause is.  Viral encephalitis caused by herpes isn’t common but, it can be life threatening.

So knowing is good.

But honestly knowing is what helps you keep others and yourself as safe as possible.  I don’t have sex when I’m feeling extremely tired because that’s a pre drome symptom I experience. ### ❤️ ### Do you feel that people who have had an outbreak act that way also? Genuinely curious because I had a crazy severe outbreak 2 years ago and nothing since. And my doctor told me I’m most likely never going to have another since that one was so bad. ### That's pretty selfish. If you give it to someone, you don't know how this is going to affect their lives. ### ""I think we should all consider why the CDC recommends not testing if you don’t have very visible symptoms.""

They don't say that surely? They don't say ""very"" visible, they say if you don't have ANY symptoms. It's the same here in the UK.

But if you DO have symptoms then the advice is go and get tested, not bury your head in the sand.

There is a massive difference between advising against asymptomatic testing and advising against testing fullstop.

What if you don't have hsv? What if you have syphilis or gonorrhoea or chancroid or any number of other far worse, dangerous infections that can and will do irreversible damage if left untreated. Are you going to avoid going to a clinic because you don't want to be swabbed specifically for hsv? If your previous partners were not aware of their hsv status, what makes you so sure they are aware of any of their other STI statuses?

Symptoms should never, ever be ignored. Burying your head in the sand and saying you don't wish to know does not change the fact that you may have something going on down there and if you are positive nothing will change that fact.

There are plenty of people in this community who are not into the pity party, who are not living celebate lives. There are large number of people here who dont actually find disclosure an issue and people who have a very upbeat and realistic outlook on their future.

Regardless, anyone experiencing unusual changes on their genitals should 100% be going and seeing a doctor. There are things far worse than hsv out there. ### We don’t have the technology because the disease is that shitty. ### Yeah I’m with you there. I’ve had the most minor shit. That I cant fully attribute to hsv. A negative test at 9 weeks after unprotected sex. And 5 weeks negative after protected and unprotected oral. 

I’ve spent the last two months on a roller coaster of completely bugging out. But in reality the hsv is not a big deal. It’s the stupid fucking life long stigma of if that is. All I could think was. It can’t be that it can’t be that. 
But just the fact that 80% of people don’t know they have it. So be it. If that’s the case and I have it. I’ll be one of the 80% ### Exactly. Very good point. It sounds so ridiculous to do that. There is a girl on here who said she did do just that. And requested a full panel every single time. And she still got it. So it just goes to show it’s not really in anyones control. 

This is exactly why the CDC operates like this. And why in some other countries they barely make a fuss over it. ### I definitely think the way some talk about herpes on here creates even more of an issue for people mentally. 

I spent the last month here and it’s just nothing but a echo chamber of fear regret and self loathing. 

So of course anyone that spends a bit of time here will start to develop that same feeling about herpes after reading all of it. ### I think this is a case of clashing things. A seemingly advanced human society sterilized from all things natural. While we still hold our animalistic biological need to procreate and have a sex ### In fairness I think the reason is because of the location of the sore and what else they could possibly be caused by.

Most people know what a cold sore looks like - the majority are fairly typical in appearance and especially if someone has had them since childhood they likely have a parent or elder telling them at some point what exactly that thing is on their face, that they cannot hide, and how to deal with it.

But genital sores are a bit different - because there are many diseases and infections that can cause sores and genital hsv does not necessarily resemble cold sores. So yes, it could be hsv and you might be confident enough to say ""yeah that's probably herpes, meh"", but you could also very wrong - it could be syphilis or gonorrhoea or hpv or chancroid or balanitis or auto imminue disease and so on and so forth, and there's the risk of something quite serious. Equally if you get diagnosed with hsv and your partner has not disclosed, what else have they not told you about? What if you are now positive for an easily treatable bacterial chlamydia infection which you now will not deal with.

That is why we have sexual health specialists who are there waiting to check us over. ### You can. Put your phone down and live life like you would before all this stupid technology.  

This goes for other health issues too. Like if I thought i may have cancer. Id probably die quicker from the stress over worrying about every little symptom. For now on I’m going to just not bother checking. Unless I’m in serious fuckin pain.  

I’ll do what I can to remain healthy. But that’s where I draw the line. ### I’m sorry to hear this :( you mention your other health conditions, do you think maybe your compromised immunity or any medications your on are triggering these frequent outbreaks? ### Their reasoning is that people finding out don’t change their sexual habits. And the harm it was doing to people and relationships was worse than it spreading. 

Suicide domestic abuse and divorce. A lot of the time because people didn’t understand that herpes can be dormant for many years. 

I mean antivirals are pretty cheap arent they? So it’s hard to believe it’s just to sell a drug ### Agreed. That’s why I’m putting it behind me. If I have it or don’t. I don’t care anymore. 

This whole debacle really showed me how weak my sense of self was. ### The CDC recommends not testing.   Why thanks to them? ### Did you take any antivirals for your first severe outbreak? ### I’m not sure what they may think ### The CDC doesn't recommend testing without symptoms and most doctors refuse too. Life is filled with risks.  If sometime doesn't want to be exposed to herpes then they should refrain from sex, oral, kissing, sharing drinks etc etc . ### I say very visible symptoms. Because hsv can show up in so many damn ways. 

You’re telling me if a guy has some lower back pain he should go get tested for hsv.  If a girl has a headache. She should go tested for hsv.  Maybe so. Idk. 

I’m saying these are some not so clear symptoms. 

And no. I never said people shouldn’t get tested for other more threatening stds. These are all included in std panels. Hsv is often not.  

Ultimately I agree though. I’m new to this and am coping how I see possible in the moment. ### I’m sure it’s not far off honestly. ### Negative test at 9 weeks is pretty convincing. ### So much easier said than done. I’m an anxious and paranoid person. I truly wish I could just snap my fingers and not worry any more, but it’s just not who I am ### Nope. The person who passed it to me is healthy as an ox and suffering the same as well as many others that I know with no health conditions. ### Not on any medications. ### Yes I was on valtrex for almost 2 years and haven’t been on them since November and still haven’t had another outbreak. ### You are who I was asking. Who is “they”? ### And what do you say to people who are stuck with this disease because they were taken advantage of/sexually abused/raped?

The CDC are so wrong for not recommending testing for this. It ruins people's lives. I suffer alot from this disease that was given to me without my consent. ### Forgive me if I come across as rude or too direct, but it reads like you're clutching at straws a bit here - I am not suggesting that a person with back pain or headaches needs to get tested for hsv and neither is the CDC/NHS.

It's the classic, physical symptoms of hsv that call for testing. Pure back pain or a headache is unlikely a cause for concern in terms of hsv; yes, these may well present themselves during the flu like stages of infection but often they will be accompanied by other more physical and alarming changes. Of course a person can be forgiven for not getting their genitals swabbed if they develop only a headache (although if they've recently had sexual contact with someone/regularly have sex, a regular sexual health check should be carried out ideally before/after a new partner). But the advice is clear - if you have symptoms of hsv, go and get tested. E.g. itching, blisters, sores, noticeable skin changes, painful urination and so on. Diagnosis should be by a professional, not by looking up symptoms on Google and going ""oh yeah I probably have herpes"", because as I say there could be any number of possible causes and these should be investigated and ruled out.

I don't know what your symptoms are but your original post reads along the lines of ""I have symptoms which match herpes, but I don't want to get tested because I don't want to know"". All I am saying is I think that that is a poor choice for you to make (but it's your choice and your body). You are assuming you may have herpes, but realistically there could be many other explanations and I presume you are not medically qualified to make that diagnosis. You also appear to start your post with advice from CDC that doesn't exist, in an effort to back up your viewpoint and I'm just pointing out that medical bodies never encourage people to just ignore symptoms.

You have authority and autonomy of your body and how you choose to use it. If hsv is indeed not a big deal for you, then better to get tested (if you are experiencing obvious symptoms) to find out if you have it/what else is causing the symptoms and then go from there. Worst case scenario you get complete clarity that you do in fact have hsv, with no more doubt about any other nasties, and you can go back to living your life continuing to believe that hsv is not a big a deal and not worth disclosing. I mentioned the other STIs because your post made it sound like you have not been tested for other infections since you developed symptoms, apologies if I misread. ### There’s no way to cure something there’s way to prevent things but for the most part no way to cure something that changes your DNA. If you find out before me let me know. ### That’s exactly what I said too. I generally am someone who obsessed about things. I need to research every little bit. And I have been compulsively anxious all my life. But now I’m at a cross roads. Either I continue being a ball of anxiety about this shit. And let it consume me and kill me.  Or I adapt like other people do. And live life more carefree. Life isn’t meant to be in control all the time. That’s what I’m learning from this experience. ### Hm, that’s strange to have such severe outbreaks. Again, sorry to hear that and hope they clear up in time. I’m not sure what makes it harder on some than others, aside from things like immunity/triggers. ### I’m saying I’m not sure how people who have had an outbreak feel. You’d know how they feel more than I. ### They just started using rna technology because of Covid. RNA technology was originally  developed to cure cancer and make people stop smoking cigarettes or what ever else. 

So I’m pretty sure medical science is going to get a lot weirder and more precise within the near future. ### That attitude is awesome and I commend you for it. But I just don’t think it’s something that the average anxious/paranoid person can do, at least not right away ### Not really strange at all actually extremely common and I made so many friends on here that go through the exact same thing I don’t mean this disrespectfully but your experience is not what everyone experiences and the people you have asked is not necessarily in the majority. ### It just sucks either way. And has ruined me. ### I just want to know if your stance of “live your life and don’t disclose” still stands for someone like me? Or are you only saying to not disclose if you’ve never had an outbreak? ### MRNA technology is completely toxic. No thank you ### Also a vaccine is not going to prevent it from somebody that already has it lol ### By the way if you think MRNA technology was only developed for Covid that’s probably the most insane thing I’ve heard in a while…. It was originally developed for herpes, HIV and Ebola and was deemed not safe enough to pass the trials over 30 years ago. Maybe do some research.. ### Trust me. I don’t know if this mindset will last. But I will try my hardest to keep it this way. I simply have no other option. I’m fucking exhausted by the constant fuckin worrying. Like it’s pathetic. And unrealistic. And a giant waste of time. Like if only we could see our selves from a higher perspective. All the time we’re wasting worrying about this shit. 

Add on top of that the amount of time us humans spend on these stupid fucking phones. I’m so done with it. Time to actually have a life. ### Didn’t mean it to come across that way, just that I think having such frequent outbreaks and ones that are so severe could point at something underlying. Maybe there are some triggers that you aren’t aware of when it comes to your own body. And it’s definitely a perspective thing, but most of the research I’ve read points to people commonly having a few outbreaks a year, if that, that generally taper off with time. Again, maybe that’s not the case, just what I’ve read. In my own case, when I was suffering from illness I had frequent outbreaks, but after changing some health behaviors I was able to go back to mild/infrequent outbreaks. I only express concern because I feel like maybe this doesn’t have to be your reality, or the reality of these other people you know. Wishing you luck! ### The data out there is clear that the vast majority of people don’t have outbreaks, let alone severe ones every two weeks. 

And yes…..

*Your other health conditions and medications are absolutely playing a role in the severity and frequency of your outbreaks.*

You literally have a brain tumor and multiple forms of cancer. 

How can you say there’s no correlation?

This is exactly what the OP was talking about when he mentioned the cesspool that is Reddit. 

I’m really sorry for what you’re going through, but the things coming out of your mouth are completely illogical and destructive to onlookers because of their utter falseness. ### You’re wrong about that. Of course you’ll find a large amount of people going through serious symptoms on here. That’s what happens on the internet. The Majority of people who have it. Either don’t know. Or barely have an issue with it.  And thus they’d feel less compelled to go on the internet to talk about the issues. ### Honestly. I don’t know. I’m just coping for my confusion of being in limbo of not having a direct answer of what I have. 

If you know for sure you have it it’s alittle different I guess. But going by what the cdc says.  If you have no direct reason to think you have it. (Very visible blisters. Or a positive test). To avoid getting tested ### Oh lord 🤦🏻‍♂️ ### I saw news about how they cured it in mice. Have hope… ### You can see in a previous comment that I said to was developed for other reasons. 

You’re annoying to talk to. Good day ### No don’t worry, I’m not offended. I think some people get it severe and some don’t it just depends and for some people it’s shocking if they have a different experience but many many many people have it as severe as me without anything underlying. My health issues are in the past. I’m a professional athlete again. I’m just not made for this life ruining shit. ### That was all in the past. Like 12 years ago. I’m not on any medication and I don’t have any current health conditions but thanks lol. My partner who gave it to me has never had a health condition in his life besides this and he has the same amount of breakouts. Oh lord 🤦🏻‍♀️ ### Has nothing to do with making me wrong about it lol…. Just because they aren’t on this thread doesn’t mean anything but nice try ### Best of luck with that hope lol ### I think she/he is a troll or works for Valtrex. Total fear mongering ### Yes, that definitely might be the case. Seems there is a lot we don’t know about the virus and maybe it does just unfairly target people. I do hope relief comes for you down the road. ### It does because the statistics literally say only 15-10% of people know they have it. So clearly it’s not effecting the majority in a terrible way. All I’m saying is people who usually have an issue with something are going to be more likely to join together on an Internet forum and make it seem like the issues are extremely common. When they’re not. Reddit has millions and millions of users. And you’re sampling like a few hundred or thousand people at most who share your same issues. ### Yeah hope is as hollow as fear 

I’ll just accept fate.  If I have it. ### I would love to see the government statistics on that. Anyway I went 33 years without it no problem until somebody cheated with a nasty whore that’s known around the town. I had no problem avoiding it until then. Would love to see research. ### Lol ok. ### I have no hope but thanks. Best of luck to you if you made the same mistake! ### Often, though, people don’t recognize their first genital herpes outbreak or later recurrences. A study by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that more than 80% of people with HSV-2 infections have not been diagnosed with the disease. ### https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2010/11/herpes-hiding

Ive seen people say it on here constantly. 80% of People don’t know they have it ### This was a really gross thing to say - ""nasty whore"", about someone else who you don't know well. I can tell you're feeling a lot of resentment from how you got it & who from, I myself was cheated on, but let's not perpetuate the notion that it comes from ""nasty whores"" please, thank you. ### These stats are what I know to be true too. No one's trying to disregard a severe experience but statistically it isn't the norm, and having that many health traumas in one's history would absolutely play a role. I know a TBI survivor (traumatic brain injury) who has frequent and intense flareups for a decade after. They still experience other side effects from that trauma, including depression & anxiety. ### Certainly lists how shitty the symptoms are at the end. I went 33 years without it until I got cheated on. Too bad I did everything right until then. ### Every single partner my whole life I made them get fully STD tested. ### I understand that feeling. I’m know it really sucks. But I share this information to help you realize you could have just as easily gotten it from someone you were committed with. 

I see you said you had everyone test before hand. Definitely harder to catch it that way. But sex always has its risks. And so many tests now don’t include hsv. 

I’m seeing it so much on this forum. That peoples doctors are extremely hesitant about testing people. ### Except ahead health issues my whole life and I’m hypochondriac so I got tested for a full panel of STDs every month I was always negative for any form of HSV but thank you. ### I never had it because I’m not dirty. I’m not going to sleep with somebody I don’t share drinks with people I don’t share make up the time I’m not dirty like that. ### Now and when I have to sleep with I have to worry if they will be the person that gets an outbreak? 
Extremely fucked up!! I want you to close to people any person in their same mind does not want that! ### Well clearly that didn’t stop you from getting it.  It just proves my post correct I think. We try to control our entire lives in every possible way but it’s ultimately not up to us. 

And we will die from the stressing over this shit sooner than we will anything else. Best of luck to you. I hope your symptoms end up very minor soon ### It’s silly to think someone’s dirty because they have it. 1 and 4 women have it. Are we gonna be misogynistic and say 1 and 4 women are dirty whores ### Yeah because the person fucked a prostitute. 
Doesn’t prove your point at all! Lol! ### I can’t personally respect somebody that will have unprotected sex without a full STD panel. ### I would never sleep with somebody unprotected without a full panel. Sounds so stupid to me. ### Risks with everything. You tried love and were cheated on. It was out of your control. ### It is stupid. But speaking as a man. My biological lust sometimes overrides that. as does for many other men.  We make stupid decisions. 

You played it safe though. And we’re EXTREMELY careful.  Yet ya still got it. 

Just goes to show the nature of this shit. Can’t control everything in life. The sooner you accept it. The sooner your nervous system will stop short circuiting from being so tense about it. 

It sucks. But so much in life does. And I’m trying to prepare my self for many worse struggles down the line ### Yeah with the horrifically dirty person and that’s not common. ### There’s a reason that there’s only two STDs in the world that are uncurable. ### Coming from a woman I don’t have lust I have respect. I’ve never had a one night stand. I’ve never slept with somebody until at least three months through the relationship when they could provide a valid STD report. I think people are too easy. Apparently I got in a relationship with a narcissist I know better now but it doesn’t help me much going forward my life is ruined. ### Sorry it’s still a disgusting disease. I think I knew deep down I was dealing with a shitty person which brings me to that level meaning that and my opinion people that get it are dirty. ### The reason is we don’t have the technology yet to cure them I guess. 

Or it’s just not made available. ### I agree. People have no self control. Christianity used to be the moral frame work for society. For all it’s flaws it did create structure for many people. And now like Nietzsche said. “God is dead. And man killed him” 

With out this Christian framework we have nothing so people are failing out of marriages. Having promiscuous sex. Etc. it’s the fall of society. Just like rome. The family structure is weakening and it’s only going to get worse it seems. 

But as a women who doesn’t have lust. You should probably just have avoided sex all together. Or married a priest. ### I understand. 

But I can say confidently seeing it that way is only going to hurt you for longer and longer. 

The resentment you have towards that man is justified. But it’s only burning you. Not him. And with this hsv shit. You’re only going to suffer more with it the more you associate it with scum and dirt ### That’s a very silly comment lust has no respect. However somebody respecting you and having love and agreeing to that does have some respect so it’s pretty clear to me why are on this thread lol ### Has nothing to do with how my body handles it. I dealt with it mentally, but thanks☺️ ### I’m just an honest human that can admit I’ve fallen to lust. 
It doesn’t mean I am pure lust. I would have far rather been married by now. In a committed relationship. But a lot of the women I’d come across had no interest in that. They wanted to live their best life. And have fun. Just the type of time we’re in these days. ### Cool. Have a good night ### 👌🏻 ### ",41,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tjrr9n/i_dont_think_its_worth_knowing/

tk8b1j,"Just wondering if this at all sounds like herpes (20M)… I had protected sex with a new partner a little over 2 months ago and 19 days after I started having some symptoms. I had a pretty bad tingling for around a week and a half, I was incessantly checking the spot and noticed some white dots on my penis, no pain just noticed them. I was icing and putting warm packs over my penis area during this as well. Around 2 weeks later I went to the doctor and they said I have a yeast infection and gave me clotrimazole to treat it. 

I still had some doubt but I would treat it as such, the white dots are still there over a month later with no change, however I started to have another tingling in my groin a couple weeks ago (7 weeks after sex) and started to put the clotrimazole on this area, the tingling quickly turned into a burning but still no sores or any blisters. Went to another doctor and they said I had jock itch but the spot where it burned wasn’t super red but I still put the clotrimazole for another week and the burning was on and off. I was still worried so I got a full std panel and came up negative for everything (including igg and igm even though it was only 8 weeks since potential exposure).

I am now having another tingling feeling on my inner thigh but haven’t seen any blisters or anything to suggest an outbreak. Could this be a reaction to the clotrimazole? (the doctor recommended I stopped using it yesterday). Is it possible to have all these symptoms without any sores? My symptoms are on and off, could it also be anxiety related? I’ve never really been super focused on the feelings down there before now so it may be nothing. Just any change in feeling or look down there and I get anxiety about it.

tkb9w7,"Herpes sore vs Ingrown hair Hey y’all

I was diagnosed with GHSV-1 in August of last year, got it from my ex partner who has OHSV-1. I had a pretty nasty initial OB because I got covid right after and since then I have had 2 more (what I think were) OBs. When I say I think they were OBs, I mean I felt some nerve pain in my leg/groin area and immediately took antivirals to prevent any other symptoms so I have never had an OB with sores present except for my initial one.

A couple days ago I had a singular bump appear on my pubic area and I am having a tough time determining whether it’s a sore or just an ingrown hair.

He took off the condom, we cuddled naked, my first outbreak was on my thigh. Probably rare. But yeah. Happens. ### What are your symptoms?

If you haven't been swabbed yet, go and get swabbed ASAP. It may not even be herpes. But its important to swab as it can tell you exactly what type it is whereas a blood test cannot. You may already have hsv1 orally and be asymptomatic, in which case a blood test could come back positive leading you to believe you have it genitally because of your symptoms when in reality you have no genital hsv infection.

The likelihood is, IF it is herpes you have genitally, that you got it via oral sex and not from her hand. ### This is how I got it. Though it was infected male to me (female). ### I see.

I did get tested three times. This last time was 9 weeks after unprotected sex. And 5 weeks since a protected encounter but unprotected oral. 

The symptoms were honestly all over.  I also just got off amoxicillin so I wasn’t sure if it was part fungal infection. Just felt itching in different places. Minor burning at different points. And a very small red areas on the shaft with what looked like the tiniest bump in the middle. These popped up in different locations over the past 3 weeks. And go away within like 2 or 3 days. 

Also had a head ache a few separate days and slight bit of leg restlessness. ### He touched him self. Then touched you? ### I believe I’ve read the same thing not too long ago. Or similar. Somewhat possible yes. I assume you got tested? ### Sorry I’m not sure what you’re asking can you explain more?
Who is the one with Hsv and where is it? What were the sex acts performed? ### Haha ugh. Thigh, labia, in my vagina, on my anus, inside and just below my nose, lower lip (that's from hsv I caught when I was 11, though,) and on my forearm. ### When you say you got tested was this blood tests or swabs? Have you had the bumps swabbed? ### Yes. ### I did. 5 weeks after. It was negative. But now am waiting for longer period ### So I got a blow Job. The girl was taking a shower before hand and had her period. For all I know she could have been touching a sore with her hand. 

5-10 minutes later she gives a blow job. There is a spot where I suspect could be a very tiny sore. But her mouth did not reach this point. But her hand was touching it.  

What I’m also asking is. Can an hsv 1 transmission from the mouth cause sores to pop up in an area that the mouth did not touch ### Wow ### Blood tests. 

They never swabbed the bumps. One doctor looked at it and said it looked like herpes. But he was also railing on me about being safe with condoms for oral. So I can tell if he was jumping to conclusions. To scare me. 

But at the same time I’ve looked at so many other possible things. And nothing else really can explain what it would be.  It’s on the shaft. It’s a small red irritated area. And a small bump in the middle. No hair involved. 

I made a post of it ### Do you know if she’s ever had a cold sore ### So if she has ohsv1 & gave you a bj , if you became infected with hsv , the OB can be anywhere in the genital area.  Anywhere in the boxer short area.  Likely it was transferred from her mouth , not her hand. ### Yes but typically your first outbreak will be very close to the area of initial exposure. But hsv 1 on the genitals is not as bad as genital herpes type 2. With hsv1 down there recurrent outbreaks aren’t as common ### After reading this though 5-10 mins is along time. I assumed it was right before or during bj ### To be fair, I consider myself a special case. The medications make it worse - THAT is just weird. I simply have unusual medical reactions with so much stuff.

I mean, I also picked my nose without washing my freaking hands lmfao

At least Abreva works!!! Very grateful for that. ### Really the absolute best bet is to get a swab ### Yes she did say she’s had cold sores before. But not at that time.  

I’m just confused why the sore may show up further down in an area her mouth didn’t touch ### Yes I’ve heard that. I’m just trying to foresee if I may have gotten hsv 1 or 2. ### I honestly don’t know if she did or not. I can only assume she was touching her self to get a tampon out or something. Probably like 2 or 3 minutes at least ### How long does it take for the abreva to work if you don’t mind me asking? ### Antiviral made my nerve pain worse but kept lesions away so I kinda know what you mean ### I will if I ever get another bump ### Did this girl tell you she had ghsv? Or does she have a history of ohsv? Cos it sounds like to me you got it through oral sex, the cause of 50% of new ghsv cases.

Or you could have gotten herpes months/years ago and are just happening to get your first outbreak now which coincided with a recent hook up.

Your hypothetical of this girl touching herself and giving it to you with her hands isn’t very logical. Especially if she was touching herself in the shower where water would wash off her hands. But it doesn’t even sound like she had an active outbreak? ### Because it does not have to be at the EXACT location of contact. If it did transfer to you in the genital region it can show up anywhere in the “boxer brief” area. 
Example…. Exact point of contact was left thigh - it could show up on your butt cheek ### Depends on how quick I get it on ### Yes she said she gets cold sores orally. 

She said she’s clean elsewhere but isn’t even sure if hsv is included on her tests.

Definitely not possible for that second bit though. I got tested three times around this period. And they have all been negative. But have had symptoms. 

I hadn’t slept with anyone for a while before her too 

Can’t know for sure If she had an outbreak. 

Afterwards she said she had a tear on her labia. But is it possible a condom and water makes that easier to happen? ### Got ya. That’s good to know thank you. ### If you have herpes, you got genital herpes through oral sex. 

If your sore wasn’t swabbed and your tests came back negative then there is a possibility it was something else.

She did not give you herpes by touching herself and then touching you. ### If she gets cold sores orally, she can def transmit it to you genitally if she performed oral sex on you. ### That’s good to know 🙏 ### Exactly, thank you for saying this! ### I know and I’m hoping that is what happened here. Vs genital transmission. ### Why you hoping that's the case? 🤔 Either way you'd get genital herpes. Doesn't matter how you got it. If she passed on oral herpes to your genitals chances are she probably did to you orally TOO in that case if you made out when she was shedding potentially. ### True. I’m hoping that because hsv 1 sheds less than hsv2. 

Overall I’m hoping I have nothing ### What symptoms have you had? Only genital symptoms? You had both hsv1 and hsv2 come back negative?? Also it is possible to have hsv2 orally so that's also a chance. More rare occurance orally but happens. 

Also yes it sheds less on average but my ex had like 3 outbreaks in like 7 years of having this and I've had over that in 3 month. Both type 2 soooo you just gotta hope you're lucky I guess ### It seems like women have them more in general. I could be wrong though. 

My symptoms were just tiny red irritated areas with a minuscule bump that would go away in a couple of days. 

 Subtle burning or irritated. And itchiness in different locations. But I also suspected a fungal infection since I just came off amoxicillin. 

Also very minor head aches on and off and restless leg feeling. Or subtle aches. 

Hard to say how much of this is due to the intense stress my body went through with anxiety. ### I totally agree about how it's hard to say exactly. See if you get any actual sores. And yes women are a lot more likely to get it. This is thanks to nature nothing we've done :) ### ",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tkfz06/girl_touched_her_self_then_touched_my_penis_and/
tk7t9m,"Birth control hormonal outbreaks Hi guys!

tk7b3l,"How to prevent Hsv-1 oral from spreading to genitals? Hi all! I (F) Just got my official HSV-1 diagnosis after a really bad primary infection. Aka, I just got it for the first time. I really do not mind, my only concern is spreading it genitally, because I already have problems with dryness and low sex drive. I’m seeing 2 people, one man one woman, both of which I’m like 90% sure also have HSV-1. My question is, how do we all prevent spreading it to each other when doing oral on the genitals? I know we should definitely not do anything when we have coldsores, but what about when we don’t? Should we wait to build up more immunity, because I believe two of us just went through our first primary infection? What are the chances of spreading it without active sores (especially because they are new infections?)

tjsdqd,"Why did this have to happen I just don't understand how my life is over this fast. I'm only 24 and fresh out of uni. I started having symptoms about a week and a day ago and I was just seen tonight by a doctor. She explained to me that with my list of symptoms and after her evaluation that she was fairly certain it was herpes. The swab had to be sent off to be checked but she asked if I wanted her to call in a prescription beforehand to get the treatment started.

I thought I had my whole life in front of me and now everythings been derailed. Once the doctor was so confident, all my hope was gone. I wanted to have a life where I could have what I wanted. Like everyone else, I've dated in the past unsuccessfully but I eventually wanted to find someone who I felt truly happy with. This will be impossible now. Every person who I'll meet and things will go well with I'll have to have this conversation just to change their minds about me. How does anyone deal with this",39,2022-03-21 22:10:52-04:00,"If you truly believe you are poisoned & unlovable then that will be a self fulfilling prophecy. A HUGE portion of the world has HSV & there are quite a few amongst that population that have found love & happiness. 

Your feelings are understandable at this time but if they persist to this extent I think seeking help would be beneficial.

In the meantime here are a couple support groups & a Ted Talk

 [Group Name is Love Profound](https://www.meetup.com/Love-Profound/)

[Group Name is Virtual Herpes Support](https://www.meetup.com/NYC-Herpes-Support-Meetup/)

[Ella Dawson’s Blog](https://elladawson.com/author/ellacydawson/)

[Ella’s Ted Talk](https://youtu.be/YcIl-hclrLI) ### My girlfriend has HSV-2 and I(32M) love her more than anything, your diagnosis doesn't define you. It was tough and frightening when she disclosed her status to me, but after I educated myself and got past the stigma that is herpes, it really doesn't create many obstacles for us. All it takes is finding the right partner. ### Your life isn’t over ### Ummm. No. 

I'm 40. Been rejected once in 10 years. Slept with several women within a relationship without protection and never transmitted it. 

Calm down, take a breath. I get that it's hard news to take in but don't be dramatic. ### It's early. It's going to take time to cope. I was diagnosed at 22.  Life goes on. It gets better. It just feels like crap right now. 

For me, I've started to view it as a way to filter out people. If you dont think I'm worth the risk of a skin rash, maybe we're not meant to be. 

I've been in two very long term relationships since I was diagnosed and they did not have it and never got it from me. I just started dating a new person, and while disclosure is uncomfortable, we are having a good, healthy, and rewarding relationship now. ### It will be hard, but it will be manageable. Many people forget they have it. Things become much less frequent/severe. Take antivirals. Keep your immunity strong. You will have uncomfortable conversations and maybe some rejections, but it is part of the territory. It sucks and it’s not fair, but it’s your reality now (as is mine). Your mentality effects this greatly. Don’t roll over and die, persevere. ### Lol grow some balls man. ""My life is over"" lool okay bro.

Ive had it since 23 and im 26 now. Ive had a normal sex life before and still do now. They have medication that controls the symptoms which is the only shitty part about it. Its literally just a small portion of skin.

You realize someone today got diagnosed with cancer, Huntingtons disease, or became paralyzed from the neck down... And you have a generic skin disease that most people walking on this planet have in some shape or form. ### I’m 24 and newly diagnosed as well. It’s been almost 4 months and I can honestly say I feel much better than I did that first month. Get a support system and try to focus your attention elsewhere. You’ll have your moments and that’s to be expected. Just try not to dwell. Take some time to mourn and grieve but know it’s not the end of the world and things could always be worse. Take it one day at a time ### I’ve had herpes for almost two years and my life feels pretty much back to what it felt like before I was diagnosed! I realize I could have easily had herpes long before my first symptoms and never known because I was never tested until I did have symptoms. 

I’ve had plenty of sex, casual or otherwise, and I’ve learned the best ways to disclose. Most people didn’t make it a big deal if I didn’t get emotional about it. 

I promise you’ll be ok. A lot of people get herpes younger than 24. I know people who were diagnosed at 18. Statistically, there’s pretty close to a 50/50 chance that’s you’d get it at some point anyways. 

If you have any questions or just want to vent, we’re here for you! ### I've had it six months now and I still feel like my life is cut short ### Did you have a recent exposure(sex)? Or did this come out of nowhere? ### I truly appreciate you sending these resources because they may be beneficial to some but I would like to ask; what good would seeking help be besides attempting to cover up the facts of the matter? I can tell myself there is support for me out there but the barebones situation for me is that I am poisoned with an unenviable condition. After having many relationships fail before I had this happened to me, what is my hope? ### How is it not? I'm poisoned with something I can't control. ### This isn't being dramatic this is just the facts of the situation. This isn't a ""calm down"" type of ordeal. I was drunk when I made this so I should've explained myself a lot better originally but it is what it is. ### I appreciate your input more than you'll ever know. I'm sure that you initially telling them was difficult but did you find that their reactions in those long term relations were difficult to manage? Were they maybe more understanding than you initially thought? I also understand if you don't want to share this. ### I'm worried to take the antivirals over the side effects. That is a part of the problem. I just don't want to experience the inevitable rejections as well. I just want it all to end and wish it was a dream but I know everyone in my position feels that way. ### ""Grow some balls?"" Try to understand that this possible diagnosis of  a ""generic skin disease"" isn't the only thing going on currently. ### Why bother commenting if you’re not actually going to offer any help? ### I appreciate you sharing this. In my case I don't want to find a support group. With my mindset it won't help. I can't not dwell on this. Last night I was an idiot and got drunk and that's the only thing that got my mind off of the situation for even a second. Waking up this morning I just feel like I can't function. I can't focus on my work because none of this stupid shit I'm doing seems to matter now. ### The purpose of the groups is to meaningfully change your perspective - the hopelessness and poison and all that.

You used a great word here - “unenviable.”  Having herpes is certainly unenviable, but it’s also _not_ the end of life as you know it, it’s _not_ a nail in the coffin for finding love or happiness or any of that.  Not by any stretch.  Right now in your current (understandable) state of mind, you probably think I’m just being irrationally positive or brushing aside the harsh truth of the facts at hand.

But I’m not.  It’s really not as dire as you currently feel it is.  Again, your current perspective is quite understandable. I think it’s safe to say _everyone_ goes through that initial stage upon contracting.  But you should waste as little time as possible in that mindset.  It will be a self fulfilling prophecy as long as you remain there.

You’ve been presented with a new challenge.  Start working on adapting to the challenge.

You’ll still date.  You’ll still find love.  You won’t have to compromise.  This virus is both very common and it also seems like a much bigger deal than it is.

Some people benefit greatly from the support groups.  But your intuition is likely right - it’s a group therapy session that’s probably mostly encouragement and positivity and “you’re not alone” type of messaging.  I wouldn’t know because I’ve never participated in one and would never feel a need to.

My low-resolution read on you just from your post and comment here is that you’re probably more like me.  You want to engage with reality on a rational and factual basis.

My recommendation is hop on Google Scholar and start researching HSV.  Read the clinical papers about it.  Come to grasp the dispassionate truths of what it is and what it is not. Research how the virus operates in your nervous system, the family of viruses that HSV is in, research transmission variables and rates, recurrence variables and rates, the therapies that work and don’t work, etc.  

If you’re anything like me, you’ll quickly start to feel relief from that existential anxiety by doing so.  We’re also seriously close to vaccines and cures.  Like <5 years.  There’s no better time in history to become part of the 20-30% of the global population with genital HSV.

You’re going to be fine chief.  Keep your head up and that rational mind of yours engaged in productive digestion of the ultimately mostly harmless pathogen you now carry alongside a billion+ other humans currently alive. ### Again, if you are convinced there is no hope for you then that will be your truth. 

It’s up to you. Good luck. ### There’s multiple ways to look at things, if that’s how you see it and receive then yes, your life is over before it started or I would suggest learn as much as you can about this virus that floats around this planet and set yourself on a new course, it’s frustrating yes, bc who would sign up for this? Just part of this incredible eco system we’re in roll with it don’t let it define u ### It is exactly a ""calm down type of ordeal"". You're going to work yourself up into a nervous breakdown over a completely manageable situation. 

It sucks. But it is NOT the end of your life. It's just another challenge you have to go through. What's done is done, you can't change it, you just have to live with it. There are a lot of things in the world worse than this. ### The disclosure is uncomfortable. And yes, I've  had some rejections. But in my 5 year then later my 6 year relationship, both partners (M) an I (F) had normal sex lives. My current 3 month relationship has a normal sex life. None of them had HSV (that they knew of) before or after.

Long term responses... Honestly it just felt normal like relationship stuff. Sometimes I'd say ""hey I'm out of commission for a couple weeks"" or ""no sex right now"" or ""it's not a good time"" and they'd understand. When I was healthy again, I'd let them know we were ""all good."" ### I take them with no side effects that I can notice! I think in the beginning my stomach hurt a couple days, but it quickly subsided. It’s a personal choice, but they helped me greatly. L-Lysine and red marine algae are supplements that can help, also! You might not have any inevitable rejections, it’s hard to say when it comes to relationships. But it’s worth trying and being honest about who you are. I have many things I’m insecure about, herpes is of course just one of the heavier ones haha. Good luck! ### Whatever dude, go back to crying. Idgaf lol ### Trust me. I understand completely. I was in the same boat. You may need to allow yourself time away from work if possible, to process everything. I know it feels like the end of the world right now. I felt those exactly feelings. I felt like everything I did and worked toward up until that point was worthless and that’s not true at all. You don’t have to join a support group but definitely find someone to talk to or vent to about what’s going on. If you don’t feel comfortable telling anyone you know try a therapist. Do it whenever you feel comfortable. I promise you, you’ll be glad you did. ### I 100% agree that we're alike in the way that you assumed. I've done plenty of research including through Google Scholar since last Saturday. It helped me none but reassured my thoughts plenty. Rational thinking or not does not change the fact that there is a point you can't come back from. ### Well then yeah I'm definitely fucked then. I can't see any possible outcome in which I have a chance at this point. I was already struggling and now this diagnosis is just all I fucking needed ### I can't handle that rejection from it. I don't want to even tell anyone about this. I was supposed to be going out with this girl coming up and now I don't even want to do that. I'm stuck ### I see. I don't want to take them over the long term effects which is what really worries me. I don't want a byproduct of this condition to affect me. ### What is your problem? ### There are also emotional states of mind that no amount of rationality can offer clarity from.  I’d know because I’ve been in plenty of them in my life.  Fortunately they’re almost always short lived - except heartbreak. Lol.  

Just give it a couple weeks bro.  I’ll check back on you.  Guarantee you you’ll be feeling calmer about the whole thing.  You’re never going to be excited to have it, but I promise it’s not the end of life in any dramatic sense.  Remember - 
 1 in 10 women (or men) in your age cohort (aka your dating pool) already have genital herpes.  You’re not doomed to a sexless life or lowering your standards to find the one.  Countless other variables play a much larger role in narrowing dating pool.  Would you be better off without this extra variable? Mathematically - yes. Of course.  But does this earth shatteringly alter your ability to find your person? Not even close. ### I’m truly sorry you see things that way. Best of luck regardless. ### I feel the same way. 22f. Decided to be alone or wait for a cure. ### RemindMe! 2 weeks ### I appreciate you wanting to check and also offering your thoughts on this.

Now that I've sobered up after yesterday I'm in an even worse place mentally. I feel disgusting and that I'm just stuck now. From as young as I can remember I've had HSV-1. I've always understood it's something I can't get rid of but it didn't change my future. I haven't had any cold sore outbreaks for a long time now anyways. This is so much different. All I've wanted was to work hard and work on myself so I can get what I want in life to be truly happy and find a good person. Since my last breakup, I've only had 2 different sexual partners but have been dating around in which none of those situations worked out. This happening to me has derailed all of my plans to eventually find a good person for me like I wanted. Cold sores are one thing but to be poisoned with something that will cause me to change my life from this point forward is unbearable to me.

Hell even having a casual hookup is impossible now because I'll have to mention some fucking condition I have that can spread to them even if using protection. What a fucking joke this is. I was planning on going out with someone coming up shortly but I don't want to even want to meet them now or anyone new. If things happen to go well with them or anyone down the road I know I can't handle them looking at me like I'm disgusting and rejecting me.

I don't feel of this as a self-fulfilling prophecy type of thing but more of a harsh reality situation. I've researched this condition all week and any comfort I would find would be in a world where humans are rational thinking and would understand that this shouldn't be a deal breaker. But sadly life isn't that way.

tjzk4q,"HSV2 transmission rate during outbreak unprotected +M to -F I understand this is an impossible thing to know exactly because how would you ethically study this lol

But has any HSV+ Men had unprotected sex during an outbreak with a HSV- Female and NOT infected them with herpes? Or is it close to 99% transmission rate? 

Or any studies/ anecdotes similar? F2M even? 

Pls help",5,2022-03-22 06:04:24-04:00,"Or if anyone has found out they had unprotected sex with a HSV+ person during and outbreak, but are still negative? ### well, over a span of A YEAR the woman has a 10% chance of contracting it without protection (sex 2-3 times a week), around 5% with antivirals and well below 1% with antivirals and condoms. keep in mind, this isn’t with every sexual act, it’s over the span of a year. i think per sexual act it’s about 0.0018%. ### If you are the male you need to be very careful while having an OB. It’s easier for you to pass it to a female, rather than a + female passing to a -male. 

Doesn’t guarantee she now has it but she should be cautious watching out for symptoms and moving forward use protection when you have an OB or think you’re getting one with anyone who is negative. ### I can say that I WAS a negative female, hooked up with an evidently positive male that did not have a visible outbreak. This happened the First time we hooked up. After him, I had my first disclosure that resulted in a relationship. He was very cool and fairly dismissive about it, I always kinda thought maybe he already had it or something because we definitely had unprotected sex during my many outbreaks. Mine are mild and I can’t/don’t take antivirals. I brought it up casually throughout the relationship, indirectly asking if he experienced an OB. Not together anymore but as far as I know/saw on his dick he never had an OB. Again, could be he already had it.

tk3vlw,"Should I be tested? Please give advice I dated someone with oral and genital hsv 1 for a couple of months last year. We never had penetrative sex but he did perform Oral sex on me one time. We’ve been broken up for ten months and I want to start dating again yet idk if I should get tested for herpes beforehand. I’ve never noticed any sores genitally or orally yet I’m aware I could be asymptomatic. If I get tested and it’s positive should I assume I have it genitally as well and how would I know if I had hsv 1 genitally? Also, I’m worried that he may have had hsv 2 as well because he told me he contracted it in September of 2020 and got a blood test in February of 2021 and his igg levels for hsv 1 was 57 and 0.90 for hsv 2. Does it sound like he already had  hsv 1 and contracted hsv 2 instead? Would it be negligent of me to not get tested I feel like it’s unethical but I’m not sure how serious it is to get tested for hsv 1. Should I just assume I don’t have it because I haven’t seen any physical evidence of it? I’m also curious to know why more people don’t have hsv 1 genitally if so many people have it orally? 



Sorry if it’s a lot of questions I just don’t know how I should go about this situation. Its honestly been wearing on me mentally for months because I want to do the right thing. I’ve tried to get tested three times and two of the times the wrong test was ordered and the last time the doctor wouldn’t perform the test because he said it was unnecessary.

Asymptomatic and unsure if I have it, but concerned about accidentally passing it on to someone else. You really just need to ask yourself - Would you be able to live with yourself in the off-chance that you DO asymptomatically have it and gave it to someone else who ended up experiencing symptoms from it?

If your answer is no, that you couldn’t live with yourself, then there’s really nothing to do besides get tested and check if you have it. 

On the other hand, if you could live with that scenario happening, then stop worrying until you have a reason to (like observing visible sores).

At the end of the day, it all comes down to who you are. I have friends with HSV who got tested and diagnosed, always disclose, and have wonderful sex lives still. But I also know people who don’t always disclose (like the person I may have contracted it from) and as long as they can live with that, then I’m sure their life will be just great as well. ### This is just an opinion do with it as you wish! I would not get tested with a regular IgG or a IGM test. Only get tested if have an active sore that can be swabbed or you are willing to pay for a western blot test! Lots of people have herpes and don’t even know! They don’t put the test on a standard panel of STD test for a reason! Save yourself the trouble unless you’re willing to pay for the right test or again can swab a sore. That’s just my opinion! I myself personally, got tested without any physical symptoms or anything and was given a false positive, wasted a lot of money, A lot of unnecessary pain and worry ### No. Absolutely not. The CDC says not to test without symptoms.  I agree. ### Not you again 
No do not get tested without symptoms you probably don’t have it ### And what is that supposed to mean? I’m asking legitimate questions I’m not looking for anybody to be rude or smart mouthed. Thanks ### I’m not getting tested for it and I don’t think that makes me a bad person. Hsv 1 is extremely common and most people contract it as a child so why should I get a test when I have no symptoms just to see if I have it. I could’ve kissed or been intimate with people who had antibodies for hsv 1 prior to even meeting my ex and still never caught it. And most people don’t even know their hsv status I just think it’s a waste of time to get this worked up over cold sores especially with no symptoms and a negative igg and igM test after we broke up. ### Just curious, how did you find out it was a false positive?

I’m just saying if not knowing is wrecking your mind this much than it’s probably better to just get the test and know for sure. ### No I don’t think it makes you a bad person. But if you’re not the type of person that can live with the thought of possibly transmitting it, then what else are you going to do besides get tested, ya know? I think the main thing to focus on is doing whatever you need to do (testing or not testing) to gain peace of mind. ###  Yes I had a false positive index the first IgG test was 1.17 tested again with IGG 2.02 and then was western blot negative! So I will never get tested again unless I have an active sore! ### I was just looking for advice on how to handle the situation. I don’t feel like going through the mental distress if I’ve never had symptoms or an outbreak yet I’m not sure if I’m entirely wrong for not getting tested because I know I was exposed. Sometimes when I read up here people make hsv 1 seem like a big deal but every doctor I’ve talked to about this situation has told me it’s very common and I shouldn’t bother to be tested. I just wanna be responsible I guess ### Wow that’s crazy! Thanks for sharing! ### I think the responsible thing to do is to get the test. Even if it is common there’s still people that don’t have it and it can be very painful for someone who contracts it and has the misfortune of having symptoms and frequent outbreaks. ### You’re welcome. You seem like a nice person and it’s good to be concerned for others. My advice going through an experience like this, is regardless it’s not a death sentence it’s only a skin condition. People make it bigger than it needs to be, I would actually date and be with someone with this no problem, I would just protect myself the best way I can. Anytime you have sex with anyone there’s a risk, so make sure The person is worth the risk. If people would just educate themselves I think we would all understand this is not really a big deal ### Okay but the person I’m dating probably has the virus anyways… idk if it’s necessary I’ve never had symptoms or an outbreak.

Why not both get tested for everything? ### He was tested for everything and I was as well. When did I say he wasn’t? Where are you getting that information for? ### To be honest, from a third party perspective, it sounds like you’re getting pretty defensive by someone giving you an answer you don’t like to a question that you seem to already know the answer to. I’ve done the same thing where I worry incessantly about something and ask for an outside opinion, and when they don’t give me the reassurance I am directly looking for, I get defensive and come up with every reason to go against them. Bottom line is, if you’re that worried about it, go get a test for some peace of mind. Even if a doctor says “I don’t think that’s necessary” you have every right to be like “but I would like to be sure, please have the test done”. Even if you’re pretty sure you don’t have it, there’s nothing wrong with getting it done just to solidify that fact and get rid of any anxiety towards giving it to someone else. ### You said the person you’re dating “probably has the virus anyways” I assumed that meant he hasn’t been tested for everything since you don’t know if he has the virus or not. ### As I just stated. I am not concerned about asking people to get tested for herpes. It is not recommended for a reason. I am more concerned about accidentally passing it on. I have literally stated that twice ### I’ve already answered that question. The only way to prevent accidentally spreading it is to get tested and know your status for sure. ### Okay thanks for your perspective I would like to talk to somebody else who has actually read through my post and answered my questions tho. ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tk3vlw/should_i_be_tested_please_give_advice/
tk2zep,"First oral HSV outbreak treatment advice Further to my last post, thus far I have developed no sign of genital herpes, though I have contracted it orally. Noticed coldsores on the inside of my lip this morning. I've been horribly ill the last few days with fever, muscle weakness, light-headedness, incredibly sore and swollen gums to the point eating and drinking is really hard, bleeding gums, a really sore throat, and a near constant headache. The doctor thought it was an infection in my wisdom teeth so I've been on metronidazole, but I now know all these symptoms align with an oral outbreak.

Now that I know I'm hsv positive I have some questions:

1. How can I treat my symptoms, other than with painkillers?
2. Is it worth getting the sores swabbed to find out if it's type 1 or 2?
3. Does the fact I contracted it orally mean that I'm unlikely to develop it on my genitals too from the same exposure?
4. Going forward, are there antivirals or any other meds I can take to prevent shedding, and can I get these free from the clinic? (UK based)

Any and all other advice welcome",2,2022-03-22 09:26:29-04:00,"2. Get tested. Type 2 usually doesn’t occur as often orally. 
3. You can still transfer it to genitals but chances are low.

tjw3g2,Lysine I know lysine hasn’t been scientifically proven but I started taking it about two weeks ago and it has made a huge difference in how I feel. I previously had nonstop prodromal symptoms with no outbreaks and now they’ve settled down. I’m also on valtrex. However I heard your body can start to rely on lysine? So should I take breaks from it? Anyone have experience/knowledge about this?,7,2022-03-22 01:52:22-04:00,"Nice, I wonder if what other people are taking to reduce outbreaks. Lysine sounds interesting, but I don't know anything of it.. ### Yep it works amazingly well.  People are just odd in their militant avoidance of anything not in a published study.  🤷🏻‍♂️

How much are you taking?   You can always mini-cycle it.  Like take it M-F and off on weekends.  Kidney concerns at high doses for long periods. ### I got my first OB back at the start of the month. Immediately started to take L-Lysine, Red Marine Algae and Zinc all to help boost the immune system. So far only had the one OB. I have heard of people's bodies relying on it as well and as soon as they stop taking it they begin to have OBs. Obviously everyone's bodies work and function differently, some people have amazing immune systems and others don't so who knows. Probably the best thing you can do it just test it out yourself if you're really that curious, if you start to get prodromal symptoms again I would say it is helping you and you probably shouldn't stop. Also the types of food you eat can be a huge factor in the fact that there's many foods that are high in Arginine which from what I've read is a big helper in cultivating and allowing viruses to grow in the body.

&#x200B;

Some evidence suggests that high levels of arginine can make symptoms of herpes worse, potentially leading to outbreaks or cold sores. This is because the herpes virus needs arginine to multiply. Also, absorbing more arginine may indirectly cause cold sores by disrupting the body’s balance of arginine and another amino acid called lysine

Found this info here \~ [https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323259](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323259)

I also recently found a pretty awesome food chart for foods that are high/low in both arginine and lysine. [https://healingcycles.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/lysine\_arginine\_foods.pdf](https://healingcycles.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/lysine_arginine_foods.pdf)  
From what I've gathered from the chart you want to be eating the foods that are all 1.0+ or if you do eat some of the foods that fall under that category take a 500mg lysine pill afterwards to help negate and counter that. ### I’m only doing 1,000 mg which is the dosage on the bottle as a supplement ### If that’s working then great.  You can add an egg for another 700-800mg not in supplement form too. ### Is lysine in eggs . I need Google that. ### A lot. ### ",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tjw3g2/lysine/

Eventually I was injured at work. she left me for greener grass.  As she said no future. 23 years later I am alone.  I refuse to be the monster my ex was.  I disclose every time.  Always before the first date.  People deserve the choice without emotional manipulation. Always rejected.  Even by someone that was known to have the same HVS 2 I have.  Even sites that are there to create connections for people like us are all catfish sites.  12 connections.  12 catfish.  I never give money.  Though I give one of them points for being somewhat honest.  As she told me she was sorry.  That I was a great guy before she ghosted me. I read so many success stories.  I call BS.  My shrink told me to go out each day and say hello to someone new.  This was 17 years ago.  People will keep encouraging me.  Tell me don't give up.   I as would they go out with someone like me.  they often side step the question.  Or they might as well live on the moon.  statistics show we are many?  so where are we?

I think there should be a Reddit group for people to meet and date with hsv. Maybe you can make one. ### For men it's a lot harder.

Herpes absolutely sucks & it sucks even more to be lied to but none of this is worth it. Hell, if by some miracle this would ever go to court, the chances even your judge & attorney have HSV are fairly high. Do yourself a favor & go live your life. ### You would need written or verbal proof of them admitting that they knew, you’d probably need a copy of their test results. You’d also need your printed negative test results from before you contracted it to prove that it wasn’t dormant in your system. 

If this is a money issue, I can understand why you’d want to sue. If this is for revenge or to teach someone a lesson, just remember that, unfortunately, it won’t change your status, or your symptoms (which will likely subside with time if you’re like most people), you’ll still have to find a way to live without letting the mental weight consume you (which you can, because I know many people who have and have myself), and you’ll still have to learn to disclose (which you also can do).

Suing this person might get you money, but it won’t force them to disclose in the future, and it won’t make your herpes go away. Most people who take legal action against their gifter decide that it’s more of a headache and even more emotionally draining. If you can’t prove that this person gave you herpes, you could even lose money to them. 

Best of luck moving forward.

Gahd I really hate seeing when people think disclosure isn't important. 

I'm so sorry :( I have no answers, just sympathy for you and anger towards idiots. ### Sue for what? You chose to have sex. There are inherent risks in that unfortunately. ### Same thing happened to me! He definitely knew and lied about it. I had an ER bill of 3 THOUSAND and spend nearly 6 weeks in the worst pain of my life. Long story short, he was in the military and I tried to reach out to his branch to ask about the possibility of pressing charges (for knowingly exposing me). They said that that has been decriminalized meaning there would be no case. I think It would be extremely hard to sue but I hope for your sake you can get some closure. I never felt like I got justice for what he put me through and it sucks so much! ### You can sue for anything. Your chances of winning are zero. You would have to prove you didn't already have it. You would have to probe he knew he had it. You would have to prove he didn't disclose.
Impossible.  Unless this was non consensual I say take responsibility for your own choices. ### It is just a skin condition, you’re the type who fuels the stigma!! You make me upset as you seem to thrive in making it out to be so terrible! ### [deleted] ### This guy is also in the military and disabled. 
I hoped that would allow for maybe a record of his diagnosis. ### It's not, it's a nervous system disease and this was said by a researcher. I suffer from this disease and it's affecting my nerves everyday. ### Thousands of dollars is NOT just a skin condition. 

My life was COMPLETELY derailed. It worked out for ME, but that's not everyone.  

It can get in the eyes, it can mess up new borns, it CAN break through the blood brain barrier. 

If you're the type that doesn't disclose,  YOU'RE a bigger problem than herpes itself. I sure hope my assumption is wrong cause less narcissistic shit heads like that, the better. 

If you can prevent the spread of literally anything, even a common cold, then do so. ### You would have to prove that:

a: they knew
b: the deliberately withheld that

Good luck with that. Do you know how many people have it and have no idea? ### I don’t know entirely if they test for hsv but I thought the same thing! It’s honestly disgusting and infuriating that it happens so often. ### First of all if someone has such issue with catching Herpes then they shouldn’t sleep with someone without a Herpes test first. There are millions of people who don’t know, ok it’s up for debate whether he knew or not but if he didn’t then it’s awful he could be dragged to court over being innocent. Takes two to tango and both have their responsibilities.

Yes it can do all those things you’ve stated but there’s many other chronic illnesses out there that are way worse. People like you need to put things into perspective.

Don’t try insinuating whether I disclose or not as that’s not what I was commenting on at all.

Herpes can be managed, yea it can be intrusive, it can cause pain, but it’s also blown way out of proportion, by people like you. I know I won’t change your mind, it’s only worth a reply because I like to try and give people perspective and hope on here, not type negativity and fear, as you do.

Honestly if you can’t offer positively then why don’t you stay away, also my 8 upvotes against your 2 kinda says it all. ### Tbh it’s your fault you had a $1,000 bill. You chose to go to the ER (or whatever) for “the flu”. It cost me $0 to figure I had herpes & receive my diagnosis. Yes I had flu like symptoms. Stories like this are exactly why sexual education & general health education are so important. Save yourself a whole lot of money by recognizing your symptoms & abstaining from hypochondria. ### [deleted] ### Point blank, DISCLOSE. 

Everything else you say isn't all that off, but REALITY sucks, and everything I stated are facts. If it's just a skin condition, why tf can you sue over it??? Hm? Why tf are people going into serious debt over it? 

Let's just end this discussion here. Pointless af. ### I'm not accusing anyone. Just stating facts. A lawsuit would be difficult if not impossible to win. ### >If it's just a skin condition, why tf can you sue over it??? Hm?

So I had the talk and he was so accepting. He asked good questions and seemed concerned for my well-being overall. I guess I was getting all worked up talking about it, he takes my hand, says “Stay calm. Everything’s going to be ok. I’d be too devastated to lose you now over this. This is no big deal and we’ll work on it. “ 

Our sex life so far has been straight fire. 

So it’s possible. I’m telling you all. It’s possible with the right person. I was skeptical too. And scared. But I think once you have that first good experience, you know it’s possible and you can have a little faith that things are going to work out. I wanted to share. This isn’t a brag, just a tiny win.",29,2022-03-21 09:49:27-04:00,"This is a perfect example of being upfront, not just about hsv, but in general. Op your on a good path.

The only sex was with the person that gave me no choice on contracting HVS 2.  She overdosed 4.5 years ago.  Even Sites devoted to us.  for a chance of connection. Have become Catfish sites.  12 connections all catfish.  If it wasn't for my need to be honest.  I would become a monster and never disclose.  23 years and still alone.  What is the use?  Yes I get people all over they world trying to give me hope.  They don't live within 200 miles from me.  Women complain about not finding quality men.  How about going after all catfish first.  protect us from the damage they cause. ### Another female with a great disclosure story.   Never a dude. ### Can I ask how long you waited or were seeing eachother to tell him? Just for personal reference as I just started seeing someone a month ago and am not sure how to proceed 😅 ### Awsome congrats ### Not disclosing before having sex can be considered Felon Assault,  Battery even Sexual Assault. ### When will there be a cure ### I'm happy for you. Glad he's not one of those f$ck and run guys. ### Sounds like he's an amazing person! Glad to hear you found someone like this! <3 Hope it continues to go amazing and I wish your relationship the absolute best of luck! :) ### So I have herpes type 2 infection just found out and my girl know she’s so sad because of it and I am too when I’m alone but we go walking on the beach and park I used to be a jerk like wanting to argue or push her away and I told I told her I cheated like a year ago I been seeing stuff but I thought it was a rash. So like I love her a lot her test results come back this week if it’s negative I’m going to love her from a distant and I want to see her happy.

I can see us together for a long time. ### A dude disclosure story 👆🏼 ### Just stop disclosing man. ### It’s only been about 3 weeks but we’ve been out 5 or six times.

I can see a potential future with him. ### Ok punctuation is your friend. Please use it!  Keep the lines of communication open. Always. This is the key. Don’t make rash decisions. Talk talk and more talk. If being this open and talking to someone is uncomfortable, you shouldn’t be having sex. ### So what you are saying is to sexually assault  Women?  That would be the charge... ### Ok so like I think I had it for a year I have herpes type 2 infection and I think I gave it to my girl I told her I cheated in the passed she still with me is it a 50/50 chance she could come back negative I want her to live her life ### In my state it is not illegal to not disclose herpes. Otherwise the chick that gave it to me would be in jail. ### You might want to look up Felonious Assault... because it hasn't been used this way.  Doesn't  mean it will not in the future.  You should have pressed charges. ### It says felony assault is with a weapon. Do you man I was just giving you another option.

Felony assault is about threat and fraud here. ### AIDS. Not herpes. ### It is about harm.  Not the illness. I think you should talk to someone. ### That’s not true at all.

tjehjy,"Disclosed to my partner and now we’re broken up he wants to use it against me I was with my ex for two years. Before we had sex I disclosed to him I had HSV-2 he said he didn’t care he loved me and I was the one and that he didn’t care if he got it. I was on the medication for a little bit but then stopped because he kept saying he didn’t care. He contracted it and didn’t care but now that we’re broken up he’s trying to use it against me saying how I’m the awful one for giving it to him and he has it for life now (we broke up because he was abusive and cheated on me) and threatened to sue me. I’m incredibly hurt because I thought I did all the right things and gave him my trust and now I might be getting sued. Can he even do this if he consented?

Edit:
I just want to thank everyone for the kind words 🥺 this whole situation has ruined my idea of dating again but all the support is greatly appreciated thank you ❤️",47,2022-03-21 11:32:16-04:00,"You did do the right thing. Your ex is an asshole and can't take responsibility for his actions. He's just trying to hurt you ### Screenshot any proof of you disclosing ### You did all of the right things. He knew when he got with you, it’s not your fault that he’s abusive and is using it against you. It’s his last resort I. Trying to control and abuse you. Don’t fall for it ❤️ ### No honey you 100% did all you could do. As you said, he was controlling and abusive during the relationship, it’s not gonna stop now that y’all are broken up. It’s just his character and has nothing to do with you. 100% & he wasn’t mad about herpes when…nvm. 

Don’t fall for the gimmicks. He doesn’t care about the herpes. My ex was the same, held it against me, but recently I found out he had sex with someone else & still has yet to get tested. Yet he was soooo hurt by me finding out what I got. Lol ### He can’t sue you. I wanted to sue the guy that gave it to me but you can’t because testing doesn’t determine when someone contracted it. So if he did not test immediately before having sex with you there is no way to determine the source. And he was not a virgin I assume. So boom. Pooh in him! ### No. Had you not disclosed this to him then yes he could. But he had full knowledge that you have HSV-2, he can not sue since he had prior knowledge and was fine with it. However to be candid, I do believe that you shouldn’t have stopped your medication just because he didn’t care! Absolutely no judgment :))! I hope things do work out for you. I’m sorry you went through all of that. ### He can’t sue u for giving him an std. 🤦🏾‍♀️ ### he can’t do anything if you have proof 

1 . change your number 
2 . block him on everything even email if you can’t block on email delete account . 
3. do NOT make any contact. 
 
if you have a problem with doing any of those it’s you 🤷🏽‍♂️ ### Yes that's someone you don't want to be with. They decided to take the risk and that's the way it goes. If he cheated he's an a hole. ### Screen shot all his other messages too. Wouldn’t speak to him only thru messages so you have a record. And once you do , then block him on everything .  If he tries to harass you more , I would threaten with police.  People like that usually go away when you become to difficult to bother. ### My goodness  darling.. im sorry you have to go through this. 

First of all  you did nothing wrong. He was abusive and is continuing to be abusive. Hanging on to the last piece he has to hurt you. It probably kills him that you're choosing to leave because I bet you he thought it tied you to him
A lot of people are scared to leave their partners to avoid disclosing again. And now the abusive little narcissistic jerk is taking it out on you.

Secondly...  he can't sue you.  In certain states he can but in Denmark or Canada (me) no he cannot. So even if you had lied and never told him.. he still can't lol  he's shit out of luck. 

Taking your clothes is a disgusting childish move for him to show you where you were before him.  And you know where you're going?  Somewhere free safe and happy.

Fuck that guy.

I wish him an outbreak in his urethra 🧚‍♀️ ### That's just sad ... stand tall and don't let him control you ... he's a scumbag...its always a douchebag ruining it for us guys trying to even get a text back lol ... karma is a b*cch and he'll get his.. ### This is all gaslighting and the right thing was done by breaking up with him. ### Actually herpes could replicate in your nerves and cause inflammation in your brain called meningitis.. Herpes could actually cause a lot of serious health issues in your brain and nerves ### Don’t feel bad you disclosed. He just wanted you to be just door mat while he is out cheating. Don’t let this discourage you from dating again. ### It’s not about if he can, it’s about if he’ll win. While he’s trying to make you feel bad for him cheating and y’all breaking up don’t let him bring down your self esteem. Block him. Let him serve you. Know the facts but don’t fret. He’d lose and irritate a judge. ### Imagine cheating when you know you have an incurable STD. Some people are really messed up ### Did you guys use meds and condems before?

Keep your head up the right one is out there... ### Fuck that guy ### Don’t worry my love stuff happens pain is temporary,you’re gonna be just fine from human to human I wanna say I love you,I too suffer and cry my own battles but we’ll be okay ❤️ ### Can you share a little bit about how he got herpes (if from you)? Did you still have unprotected sex after you disclosed to him or he just got it even though you had been using condoms? ### Sounds like he’s just a bitter asshole and trying to hurt you any way he can. You did the right thing. He can’t use it against you. He clearly wasn’t the right guy for you. ### I have screenshots and everything ### You can sue the person who gave you herpes? I'd they didn't disclose? ### Thank you I appreciate the kind words ❤️ ### Well, it’s not recommended for all to be on daily antivirals. In my country (Denmark) we only get medication for outbreaks, and if we get them often, then we get to take the daily antivirals. There’s no reason to take it if you have, like, one outbreak a year (I know it’s because of lower transmission people take them, I just wanted to point out it’s not common everywhere). ### Thank you! I know I was stupid to stop the medication and I have now learned. Again thank you for the kind words! ### Thank you! The police are already involved since he has stalked me and harassed me after I moved out ### Yes thank you for understanding. And I agree I hope he has the worst outbreak of his life so he can attempt to feel the pain he has put me through ### Thank you ❤️ yes I’m hoping karma comes through ### Ya you have nothing to worry about but obviously your feelings are valid and that’s horrible of him ### I wouldnt worried about being sued then if you have screenshors of you disclosing it. People don't usually win a law suit for getting herpes with someone unless there are other things being tried as well (mainly rape). ### You can sue anyone who knowingly has an STI/STD and does not inform you before having sex with them ### I think it would be very hard in the US but maybe not in other countries. Cause so many people are asymptomatic and don’t know they have it (at least hsv-1) that it’s almost impossible to prove things. Also my doctor told me i don’t have to disclose for kissing people but I still chose to disclose ### Ahh I see! I actually didn’t know this! I appreciate you educating on me this! 🥰🥰 ### Oh you’re fine! The important thing is that you did the right thing and disclosed your HSV-2 before anything! It sounds like he’s being childish.. for what reason? Unsure but he knew so it’s a little head scratching… ### Don't even waste your time on that... seriously.  Just keep your head up high. ### How can I do that if they won't ever admit to knowingly giving it? ### I honestly think he just wants revenge. He was very controlling for the whole relationship and the fact I decided to leave is killing him. He has also said he was going to sue me for all the money he spent on me in the relationship. Which by the way he threw out a could chunk of my clothes. But yes he’s definitely childish. He did a lot of damage to me and still thinks he is the victim because I left him ### Honestly I’m not the best person to ask for advice because I genuinely don’t know much, maybe research? I’m sorry I couldn’t be of more help ### The attorneys are within their right to lodge an inquiry into the defendant's medical record if judges and attorneys believe they have to do so. ### I’m so sorry about all this! Yeah, it definitely seems like he’s just trying to find an upper hand. You did the right thing by leaving and you’re so strong for leaving honestly. Idk you but I’m so proud of you ❤️. ### Thank you so much. I greatly appreciate the support because it was so hard for me ❤️❤️❤️ ### No, no - you aren't stupid. Medication is a personal decision, and for females to males, with just avoiding sex during outbreaks, it's a 4% chance of transmission per year. 

If you add daily suppressives, it's a 2% chance per year. Statistically, that's not that significant of a difference. 

Your ex is an ass who doesn't deserve you, and don't spend a minute blaming yourself. He took his chances, you were honest, and now he's being a big jerk. 

Hang in there. 💖 ### Thank you so much 😭❤️ I appreciate the support ### ",33,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tjehjy/disclosed_to_my_partner_and_now_were_broken_up_he/

However, I'm an avid cyclist and also swim and struggling with not being able to do the things I enjoy without pain/ discomfort. Had anyone found ways to relieve pain while cycling? Also, does anyone know if exposure to chlorine while swimming will make my sores take longer to heal?

Hearing ""herpes"" puts people off, no matter what. And doing it in person puts them on the spot and their initial reaction might be super confusing to you. ### I prefer in person because I can show people how little it effects me. 

I start with “hey this isn’t really a big deal in my life but before we have sex I have to let you know I have herpes. Do you know anything about it?” And then I have a conversation from there ### I don’t like using that word either. I use HSV2, ask if they know what coldsores are and explain from there. 

I don’t like doing it over messages because of screenshots these days but that’s just me. If sex is on the sex, the sooner the better. They aren’t interested, easy to move onto the next instead of dragging it out and hurting anyone. Yourself included. 

It’s good to do research for yourself so you’re able to provide educated answers to people. You can explain in a less “intimidating(scary)” way. Let them ask questions and time to think about it.

tjvl7t,"Confused about igg vs. Igm testing Hi all,

I’m a bit confused about these testings for antibodies. Can they only tell if you have herpes/ what strain… but neither can tell if it’s oral or genital? Is the swab test different? I got diagnosed with genital hsv1 but I’m a bit confused how they even determined this. They took a swab of my outbreak (about 3-4 days after getting symptoms)… does the swab do both igg and igm testing or is this only from blood and the swab test is different?

It’s stressful at first but herpes really isn’t all that bad at all in my experience. For some, yes, but consider that millions and millions of people have HSV and only about 25k come to this sub. This is not an accurate depiction of what it’s like to live with herpes especially because most people who post here are newly diagnosed and are panicking because they’re now exploring unknown territory. The vast majority of people living with herpes either 1) are blissfully unaware that they have it or 2) are still living happy healthy lives despite the fact that they are aware of their status. 

Keep your chin up! It gets better. Always down to talk if you need. ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tjwd4z/25_female_diagnosed_with_hsv1_and_2_in_february/
tjs444,"Confusing IgG parameter after testing. Decided to have a full panel done after my last boyfriend. I [31F] did not know his status, but we used condoms every single time. We dated less than a month, but I know that doesn’t matter.  The last time we had sex was February 21st, and I just got my results back this morning after testing last week. 

I’m aware that the blood test is often unreliable, but after seeing a bump on my labia last week, I wanted to get some labs done. My screening was done by Labcorp and read:

HSV1 Negative > .91
HSV2 Negative > .91

Index was .90 for each strain.

Their equivocal range starts at 0.91, so I’m riiight on that grey area border. The little sore on my labia has since disappeared, but being so close to the equivocal range still makes me believe that I’ve been exposed and it may have been too early for antigens to build. 

I have an appointment with my gyno on April 26th, so I plan to retest then, but based off the info above, am I reading things right? 

Thanks!",9,2022-03-21 21:57:18-04:00,"You are less than .90. They didn't give you an exact number, just said that you fell below that number. 

Did you do this through your doctor or a website? See if you can get an exact index value. ### This is nowhere near positive. You should not read into anything ### I’m sorry, I need to edit, but my index number IS .90, for both strains. ### Thank you for your input. I was just curious as to if I may have tested too early, and if I was reading my first set of results correctly. ### You need to be greater than 91 to be equivocal.  

You’re not in the gray area border.   Technically the whole equivocal range is the gray area border.  

This is a confirmed negative test.  Congrats. ### I’m not suggesting you tested too early. I’m suggesting you’re assuming a lot from almost no evidence ### Interesting. As stated above, I know the blood screening is notorious for pumping out false positives/negatives, but even if I tested too early, if that little sore I had was indeed an outbreak, surely I’d be in the equivocal range? 

I unfortunately wasn’t able to get to a clinic fast enough to get a swab. This virus is a tricky little fucker  to try and identify in time. ### You tested at 1 month.  A decent time frame.  

I think the pitfall here is you’re thinking that you’re just borderline equivocal because of the 0.90. 

But every person I know that definitely doesn’t have herpes has the exact same results that you got. 

For some reason they always print it out as being the 1 notch under 0.91. 

0.90. ### Thank you for your input. While I will definitely test again next month, I just wanted to make sure I was interpreting my results correctly. ### ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tjs444/confusing_igg_parameter_after_testing/
tjvbxr,"Is herpes more complex than HIV? Hi all, 
I just watched a commercial for a daily medication for HIV that causes patients to have undetectable levels of the virus. Why haven’t we gotten there (functional cure) with HSV? Is there something in particular about the virus that makes this exorbitantly difficult or is it the fact that people and researchers view HSV as less than malignant? The effects of HSV on patients causes/can cause a serious decline in quality of life in a multitude of ways. I, like almost every single one of you, would do just about anything to get this to go away - even if that meant keeping H and having peace of mind that I cannot be transmissible to others. Thoughts?

While herpes sucks and can lead to some really awful consequences, it in no way possible to compare it to HIV in terms of threat.

tjnw23,"Another is it HSV thread? I read tons in this community! Lots of helpful people here! I'm going to go by the rules guidelines. In asking my questions

 

* **What part of the body is involved? Mouth area, genital area, or some other area?**

Lip Line

* Where are your symptoms located *within* the above area?

Yup! 

* **What do your symptoms** ***look like?*** **Eg blisters, bumps, pimples, cuts, ulcers/lesions, a rash, chafing, etc? If blisters/bumps, how many are there? How big are they? If a rash, how big an area does it cover?**

It was ..weird, I came home from work and talking with my roommates, and then proceeded to adjust my mustache as all beard people do! Then felt something kinda bumpy. I check the mirror and It was a MASSIVE White head it seemed, alongside another tiny white head next to it. I SHOULD have taken a picture , I'm annoyed I didn't, I panicked and popped them but got distracted by someone calling my name I didn't even see what came out, I know, I got NOTHING for you guys to work on.

* **Do bumps appear to be solid or have liquid inside? If any liquid has come out, what color is it and what consistency does it have?**

I actually didn't get to see what came out, but I barely touched it and they popped. They left 2 tiny holes and scabbed within hours.

* **Are any physical sensations associated with your symptoms? Do they hurt or itch? Do they have any sensation when you are not touching them? What about when they are touched or rubbed?**

No sensations , no itching, no burning, nada. If I touch them I feel something, but nothing you wouldn't already experience messing with a pimple.

* **How long have your symptoms been there?**

I guess I've been monitoring it for 3 days?

* **Have they changed at all since they first appeared? If so, how?**

Scab, then fell off in the shower, this was roughly 2-3 days total.

* **Are you experiencing any other symptoms in addition to the visible ones on your mouth/genitals? Eg headache, fever, body aches, tingling sensation on the skin, etc? Do** ***not*** **just say that you have ""flu symptoms"" or ""flu-like symptoms"". Tell us the** ***specific symptoms*** **you mean by that.**

Nah, had canker sores, but I know HSV and they aren't related .

Please include any other information you think might be relevant.

The day after where one head, (I hope is a pimple) scabbed, I went nuts and squeezed it hard, and had clear oil come out. Made the area sting for a bit , then scabbed and I left it alone. Came off in the shower last night. 

I've always been sexually active, especially orally both up and down stairs of all sexes. So the idea of having HSV1 isn't really mind blowing, but since I have a partner of 5 years , If HSV decided to show it's face in my 30's then I wanna be safe. I would have gone to the doctor to swab, but there really isn't anything to swab..which makes me think it isn't HSV. 

TLDR Giraffe!

Got 2 BIG heads, they looked white/yellow . Didn't see what came out, because I was panicked. They scabbed after a day, I squeezed and pissed off one, oil came out it seems. No Tingling burning etc. Been checking pretty much every couple hours to see if there is any changes. Just seems like it's two normal pimples healing, but again I COULD BE WRONG! HSV 1 or 2, pictures are so frustrating to google! 

Are there any CLEAR ""yeah this is HSV"" or ""Yeah thats a pimple""

I’ve heard people say that if you stop taking it the OB’s come back with a vengeance. Will it help if I just wean myself off? I’ve only been taking it for a little over a month. Also I’ve only had GHSV for about 4 months. I’m hoping my body can handle it on its own.,2,2022-03-21 19:59:20-04:00,"Do you know which type you have - ghsv1 or ghsv2? 

At 4 months, it's still a new infection, and hard to predict. If you stop the lysine, and get an outbreak, it doesn't mean it's the lysine, it could just be your infection. 

Also, you have antibodies now. Your body has done all it is going to do. Things will settle down, but some people get more frequent outbreaks than others. It doesn't mean your body isn't handling it. It's the very nature of the virus - it recurs. It's not a failure or something if you get recurrences. 

If you have ghsv1, you might have far fewer recurrences than with ghsv2, so that's a consideration, too. Ghsv1 averages 1 outbreak a year, ghsv2 averages 4-5 a year. ### I have GHSV1. I know outbreaks are supposed to be infrequent with that type but I’m worried because I know it’s pretty much a case by case basis. I just don’t want any tissue damage or long term effects.

tjso6j,"I think I may have herpes aka my fiancé is cheating on me I am extremely worried I have herpes. I have been in a committed, 4 year relationship with my fiancé. In the 4 years I’ve dated I have never had an issue like this. 

Last Thursday I was rushing and wanted to shave a little bit down there. I used an old electric shaver we have and quickly ran it over two specific areas. I know it was sloppy and I felt it catch a few times but I ignored it. That area is very high friction for me and because of that, I have multiple skin tags (which were tested by my gyno) down there. So I know I cut some of them. I stupidly then put on bike shorts and immediately worked out for about an hour.

A few hours later I noticed that the area where I shaved had big, fleshy, red lumps with what looked like a cut/opening in the middle. It looks like some of them are cut/irritated skin tags, and I know I accidentally shaved one off. Since then, they’ve calmed down and gotten smaller but some have formed tiny blisters and others look like open but healing sores. Like flat and white in the center. They look very similar to a lot of herpes pictures I’ve seen. 

I’m terrified that my fiancé cheated. I want to believe he hasn’t, since we both work from home and since the pandemic started we’ve been together almost the entire time since then save for small periods.

I almost want to comment cancel the doctors appointment and relax ### Doesn’t sound like herpes. You didn’t mention anything about burning, stinging, deep radiating nerve pain, etc. 

If this would have been your initial outbreak, most people who have noticeable symptoms describe it as serious pain and discomfort, not mild. Most people *know* it’s herpes because of the distinct feeling. 

That being said, some people have mild symptoms for their first outbreak, and if you’re worried about it you can get tested. Keep in mind that if you have a blood test done, that doesn’t mean that it’s a new infection. You could have contracted it before meeting your fiancé and been asymptomatic since (which isn’t uncommon). ### ",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tjso6j/i_think_i_may_have_herpes_aka_my_fiancé_is/

Fast forward two days and I’ve now begun to feel a slight stinging/irritation just under the head of my penis. There is a single circular like patch of skin that appears to be shiny at the source of the irritation. The irritation at this point is slight but consistent now that I’ve realized it. I’m hoping I’m just in my own head.

I should caveat that I had also masturbated an aggressive amount over the weekend so my hope is that I just irrated my skin and potentially rubbed a part raw.

I haven’t seen any other symptoms besides this up to this point but am very nervous if I’m experiencing a first breakout either through this altercation, if I did receive oral with out a condom and I just don’t remember it. I was also told by an ex girlfriend over a year ago she was diagnosed hsv1 positive during a time we hooked up when we were not using a condom. I took at blood test then 3 weeks after expose and was told I was negative.

Can anyone tell me if they have seen similar symptoms before their outbreak or if this sounds common? Or even like another STI…

I just moved to a new city across the country and I’m alone and very nervous with no one to seek advice from.",8,2022-03-21 21:29:53-04:00,"Sounds like it’s not herpes. 

I caught herpes while wearing a condom (which I didn’t even know was possible) and the only affected area was that around the base of my dick that wasn’t covered by the condom. 

If you’re worried get a blood test done. Ask for igg specifically. If you do test positive, that doesn’t mean it’s a new infection. You could have contracted it a while ago and just been asymptomatic. 

If you test negative, understand that a *lot* of people have HSV, either 1 or 2. Most of those people are asymptomatic, so they don’t even know they have it. So even if you ask someone “do you have herpes?” And they say “no I don’t,” the only way to really know is to ask to see their printed igg numbers. After asking a handful of people, you’ll start to realize that isn’t really a sustainable way of protecting yourself from herpes. Many people have had cold sores since childhood, so while they’ll say they don’t have herpes, they can still pass it to you orally through kissing or genitally through oral sex. 

Basically, herpes is super illusive, peoples test results flip flop, most people who have it are asymptomatic and unaware, so you can do your best to avoid it, but there’s really no telling who has it! It’s best just to use protection and get tested regularly. ### Thank you for your response, the part currently experiencing issues was covered but I did have some unprotected sex around 20 days ago so I guess that could be the route as well? But I read 2-10 days is the typical period and a large drop off. 

Nothing has really changed since yesterday and the sting isn’t unbearable just every now and again and annoying, I even showered without pain using soap so it’s weird. The part of the skin is just a tad bit whiter than the rest but that’s what makes me think it may blister. 

If you don’t mind I have a couple other questions for you if you’d have an option them? 

What do sores typically look like at early stages? I read they are usually bumps not what looks like just a white part of my skin. 
Would anything else to your knowledge potentially cause something like this? 
You think I could have cut myself even and the wound be white? 

Sorry my mind is just kinda running. ### It could be anything from skin irritation to a fungal infection. 

My first symptom was a papercut-like lesion that developed into a small cluster of blisters. I had radiating nerve pain in my groin and down my thighs. ### I’m so sorry… Does it typically cause nerve pain like that? I’ve only felt tingling and irritation so far at least. ### Don’t be sorry! It could’ve been way worse. And yes it does typically cause nerve pain as herpes attacks nerve cells. 

My symptoms lasted for about a week. It’s been two years and I haven’t had any symptoms since. It’s like I never even had herpes in the first place. Sometimes I wonder if I even really did 😂 ### What does the nerve pain feel like if you mind me asking? I hope you’re right about the irritation or fungal, I did go to a bath house and was in a very wet and steamy environment the day before. Maybe I did it to long and got irritated. ### So glad to hear you haven’t had symptoms since. ### The nerve pain felt like a sunburn essentially, or like a bee sting at times ### ",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tjrkjx/27m_who_just_moved_across_the_country_potentially/

Any advice, funny story, happy or sad story would be greatly appreciated. Just wanna know Im not the only one on this boat!",8,2022-03-21 09:55:14-04:00,"Generally I display it on my profile. My hits or lackthereof seem to be the same if i have it in the info segment or not. 

I generally disclose it upfront within the first 5 minutes of talking to somebody. Surprisingly, Tinder and OKCupid have been the most successful for dating and hook ups/FWB whilst Bumble, PS generally suck ass.

I've talked to more HSV+ peeps on Tinder than I have Positive Singles. ### I personally don’t have it on my bio. The whole world doesn’t need to know I’m hsv+. You know what I mean? I disclose if we start talking off the app if we make plans to meet up before the first meeting. If this person is a mature adult, they’ll respect you for disclosing. ### Positive singles is terrible and exploitative. 0/10 would not recommend but honestly I'd say get to know somebody on the app like normal and disclose when you feel things are about to get sexual. I did it 4 times and only got 1 rejection because of it. ### Same here! Would love to hear people's experiences ### When I was using apps more regularly, I would disclose usually by the first or second date. It would always vary. 

I suggest “practice disclosures” with people that you’re not that attracted to at first so it’s low stakes. If they reject you, it’s whatever because you’re not even that attracted to them. This gets you used to the feeling of saying it out loud, and let’s you practice how to handle different reactions. Not a waste of time at all in my opinion and I’m glad I took the time to have these practice dates. 

Just remember that there are MILLIONS of people out there, herpes or not, so don’t put so much value into what one hot/funny/smart/wealthy person thinks of you. Even if they tick all those boxes and reject you, there is someone else who will also tick those boxes and won’t give a shit or has herpes themselves. Don’t take it personally, if they reject you it’s much more about their lack of education about HSV than it is about you. 

Keep your chin up! It gets better. ### I commend you for putting It on your profile straight up! I don’t think Im comfortable doing that and have had trouble after disclosing. Seems like they are all interested up until my big scary herpes comes along. Interesting that you’ve talked to more ppl with herpes on tinder…maybe I should consider disclosing on my profile.

Tested about 2 months ago almost now and was told negative for both 1&2 on igg. Wasn’t given an index value tho. Waiting on western blot results for reassurance. ### So if it pops/opens and scabs after that’s a little more telling with the symptoms.. but my IgG Were low positive ranging from 1.2-1.5 - I am not sure what encounter this could possibly be from because the person I slept with unprotected was negative, so unless the ex boyfriend i has it and never told me I have no idea ### They don’t really pop though. Idk it’s weird. They’re barely even there. Just looks like a raised bit of skin. 

How long after that encounter did you test? ### Interesting.. so that is the same as me then. I waited only 7 days but they say you are supposed to wait 3 weeks and then test again at 12 weeks if you’re still unsure about symptoms ### I see.  I tested at 5 weeks and was negative. Hsv2 went up from .1600 to like .1800 but I think that means anything. Hopefully. ### ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tjjxlu/how_many_of_you_have_almost_unrecognizable/
tjohg3,"Gave my girlfriend an infection So I went through the whole gammut. Gammit? Gammat? Got treated for UTI ,clymidia and a fungal infection despite having tested positive for it... because balanthis isn't  usually caused by HSV2 they simple never tested it.



Well... now i tested positive.. the only wierd thing is I have no bumps... only a swollen head

AND i gave my girlfriend a yeast infection (cheesy discharge)

Which begs the question... do I have both?!

Has anyone ever  had just straight up balantitis from HSV2?

tjdt7b,"Disclosure to future partners after dating HSV2+ but no personal outbreaks I've never seen this discussed.
I've been HSV+ for 7 years, haven't had an outbreak in several years. Dated my ex for 5 years and they never had an outbreak so hopefully did not contract. But we all know that it's possible they are an asymptomatic carrier.

I'm just curious if people who have dated HSV2+ partners and never experienced outbreaks are expected to disclose that fact to future partners. I hate the idea of being ""outed"" to strangers without my knowledge. But of course I understand it may be the ethical requirement.

Edited to add: CDC does recommend testing despite not outbreaks if you have had a previous partner with positive status.

I think it’s between 50-70 %. ### Igg can differentiate between Hsv 1 & 2.  Without an OB it can not tell you the exact location. So the assumption ends up being if you test positive for hsv 1 , you likely have ohsv1.  And with hsv2 it is likely genital as ohsv2 is possible but less common / rare. 

Problem is igg antibody test may give a false neg. 30% with hsv1 and 8 with hsv2. 

Also need to watch for low positive results especially with hsv 2.  False positive with results under 3.5. 

Western Blot the best test. ### And when you pass it to a partner and they have an OB , or you pass it to many without their consent ?  Guess you feel amazing then. Selfish not to test & disclose. ### ""Although CDC does not recommend that everyone get tested for herpes, herpes testing may be useful in some situations.

tjbs2z,"Day 9 Good morning, I’m on day 9 after unprotected sex. Tingle is still here, comes and goes.

I’ve been lethargic but I think it’s due to being in my head. I urinate still pretty frequently. Lower back a bit tender, again could be due to the cocktail of drugs I’ve taken. Also have a slight itch on my thighs from time to time. 

The tingling, the tender groin (v-cut), the lower back tenderness, and slightly itchy thighs are all things I’ve read in the testimonies of hsv2 positive individuals….

Something is still off but I have had improvement. 

How about you? ### Very similar. Things have decreased a little, no visible marks still. Today is day 10. Yesterday I got tested for everything but HSV 1 and 2 and awaiting those results. I go on Monday the 28th to be tested for HSV 1 and 2. After explaining in detail the timing of events he was very optimistic and reassuring. He warned the early tests can be inaccurate both in terms of negatives and false positives so we planned to test multiple times in different intervals so I can get the answers I need. I’m a hypochondriac all the way and I have become physically I’ll from worry in the past so it makes it very hard to tell what I’m truly feeling because my body is going haywire. I have calmed a bit and with that the sensations have decreased a little but I still feel things at the head of my penis, urethra, sometimes my balls feel tense like I sat on them, and just tightness, but I’m also feeling super tight all over from muscle fatigue from how I react to anxiety so it’s hard to tell and a really tough waiting game to play. ### The tightness I can attest to as well. I think I’m in the same boat as far as the mental stress affecting my physical as well. I mentioned this before, but regardless of the outcome this has changed me for the better forever. Never felt “untouchable” per say but I am definitely going to be more cautious and responsible with my future dealings. Again, hopefully it’s just an infection.. hopefully our bodies just didn’t agree with the PH we came in contact with… we’ll see bruv. ### I feel the exact same way. Regardless of outcome this is perspective I’ll never lose. Just really hope I learn the lesson without the permanent reminder. Haven’t been doing to well mentally prior to this and partially why I’m in this mess to begin with. I feel for everyone on this sub so hard. ### Wow. Me as well. I literally was going through something and in turn did something irrational… having a hard time forgiving myself. I normally will sit with myself in difficult times and reflect … and eventually push through. This time I did something out of character… think about everyday now…. and I couldn’t agree more.

tjpoet,"I really need advice 
I dated someone with hsv 1 orally and genitally briefly for five months in 2021. I now have suspicions that he may have had hsv 2 as well. He showed me his test results when we first began dating and it said he had an index of 57 for hsv 1 and 0.90 for hsv 2. I’m aware that 0.90 is usually seen as equivocal however different labs have different standards for testing and beside the number is said negative. My only concern is that he said he contracted it in September of 2020 and tested in February 2021 and his antibodies were already at 57 for hsv 1 that’s why I believe he contracted a hsv 2 infection instead. Is it possible that his antibodies could be so high in such a short period of time? When we were together we never had penetrative sex we just kissed and he only gave me oral once. What is the possibility that I now have it? He was taking medication as well. I’ve never seen any sores or anything but I know the virus can lay dormant. I’ve tried to be tested three times and twice the test were mixed up by the doctor and the last time the doctor I seen refused to get the test done. Is it worth being tested for? I’m honestly a nervous wreck because of this situation my ex and I have been broken up for ten months now and I want to start dating but Everytime I just start thinking about what if I accidentally give someone herpes. If I get tested and it is positive for hsv 1 should I assume I have it both orally and genitally because he gave me oral sex or just assume I have an oral infection. Someone please give me honest feedback because I am incredibly stressed and worried about this situation. I don’t wanna accidentally give someone herpes but I also don’t feel like I need to put myself through the mental stress of being tested when doctors don’t even recommend it",25,2022-03-21 19:54:23-04:00,"I feel like you need to be mindful that you are asking a group of people that do have herpes. I get it's overwhelming at the beginning but you had all the time you were with him and the 10 months following to come to terms with herpes.

I was diagnosed a week ago and i was stressed in the beginning but I turned around within a couple days.

It just isn't gonna feel great to hear about someone that was with a partner but too worried to have sex with them and 10 months on is worried to have sex with anyone cause there's a chance they could have it even though they don't know at all.

I'm mostly saying this for people I know in this group are insecure about it cause I personally don't care.

But as far as what Id say to you. I got it from receiving unprotected oral from someone that was asymptomatic so it can happen. Doesn't mean it definitely did.  If you are testing negative and have no symptoms, don't assume you have it. Just test for it between partners if you want but don't stress yourself. 

Also if you're this worried do be aware most people have hsv1 and hsv2 is also pretty common and most people who have it don't know. So any future partners could have it too and if you care as much as you seem to you should make sure you know their status. That means asking about this specifically since standard STD testing doesn't check for it. ### Have you ever had a cold sore?

What if you have it to your ex?

How did you start assuming hsv2 was a factor?

Im really confused by all this & I’m not 100% sure if some of it is me missing important info because it’s a wall of text with no paragraphs that is extremely hard to read. ### >Is it possible that his antibodies could be so high in such a short period of time?

Yes, absolutely. That's 5 months. Antibodies develop within 3 months, and that's all it takes.

&#x200B;

>0.90 for hsv 2

Are you sure it said that exactly, or did it say <.90, which means less than .90, which would mean anywhere under .90, clearly negative. If he had contracted hsv2, that number would have been positive by the time he tested 5 months later. 

You can test, but you were only at risk for hsv1, both orally and genitally. If you test positive, there is no way of knowing when you acquired it - from him, or some time in your childhood or from someone else you kissed or got oral from. Since you haven't had genital symptoms, it's very unlikely that you have it genitally. 

The hsv1 IgG test misses 30% of infections. There's no way of knowing if your previous tests missed yours unless you get a Western Blot test, which is expensive, and without symptoms, kind of pointless. You'd have no idea where you have it - oral or genital - if you test positive, though statistically, it would be oral.

67% of people under 50 globally have hsv1. Hsv1 isn't really anything to freak out this much about. Let it go. ### No I’ve never had a cold sore. And I didn’t give it to my ex I was tested for herpes before we started dating and was negative for both hsv 1 and 2. He knew he had hsv because as I stated he contracted it after sleeping with somebody before meeting me. ### Why are you freaking out so much lol
Don’t even bother testing unless you have symptoms ### I’ve had herpes for almost two years now. In my personal (yet unpopular) opinion it’s not worth getting tested unless you have symptoms. 

If you test positive for HSV1, many professionals advise non-disclosure. Disclose to a handful of people, it only takes a few negative experiences to understand why. People are hypocrites. You’ll say “hey for your safety I need to let you know I have oral herpes,” they’ll say “gross no thanks,” you’ll say “well it’s just cold sores,” they’ll say “no it’s not, everyone gets cold sores. Hardly anyone has herpes.” At least this has been my experience. 

Let’s imagine you do have herpes. What’s different about your life now? You don’t have symptoms, it doesn’t sound like you’re disclosing to new partners, and until you have a positive test, why would you? If you’re worried about the morality of it, you can tell new partners “hey my last partner had herpes but we never had penetrative sex, I’ve never had symptoms and I’ve never tested positive for it since.”

Let’s imagine a scenario where you play it safe, you’re celibate until you know for a fact that you are negative for a virus that more than 50% have some type of (1 or 2). Even then, are you really stopping the spread? If you’re slowing it, it’s only marginally. People will continue to have sex, however safe, knowing their status or not, disclosing or not, and herpes will continue to do it’s thing. 

I’m the scenario that you are negative for herpes, so many people carry it asymptomatically and are unaware that the very next person you sleep with who thinks they’re “clean” could be the person who does in fact give it to you. And if not them, the next person you kiss, so on and so forth. 

Basically herpes is a phantom that’s omnipresent and there’s really only so much you can do to avoid it. You can ask to see peoples printed igg levels, but then you have to take their word that they haven’t been physical with anyone since their test. You also have to hope that they were tested after the undetectable period of 2-4 months. If they were tested immediately after their last exposure, there’s a high chance the test is inaccurate. 

I’m just some guy on the internet, speaking from my experience and the other stories I’ve heard from the sub and other people with herpes that I know in real life. Take it with a grain of salt, but my advice is don’t stress. If you end up getting herpes, it’s not the end of the world. Like at all. My heart goes out to those who deal with constant symptoms, but that likely won’t be you. ### I didn’t not have sex with my ex because I was too scared of catching herpes I didn’t have sex with him because I’m a virgin and I personally didn’t feel ready to go that far. So I don’t know where that assumption came from. I’m not up here making any one feel bad about having herpes clearly I’m not judgmental because I dated someone who had it. I’m just stressed over the fact that I don’t want to accidentally pass it to someone. ### And then your saying I had the time I was with him and the time afterwards to come to terms with herpes. Yet it’s a little harder to come to terms with the fact that I put my health at risk for someone who cheated on me and used me for months and was just all around emotionally mentally and verbally abusive and manipulative. So yes I have a right to be anxious. ### The test results stated 0.90 not less than which is why I’m so worried. What are the chances of me giving someone hsv 1 genitally if I have it orally ### I tested one month after our last encounter and was negative for both. Could that be accurate? ### Because I feel like it’s unethical not to test being that I know I was exposed to herpes I don’t want to accidentally pass it to someone I care about. ### Okay so if I do get tested and its positive should I assume I have it genitally as well? I’ve never had an outbreak or anything. Someone once told me that genital hsv 1 usually appears right after an individual contracts it and it doesn’t stay dormant for long periods of time. Is there any truth to that? Are people still able to perform oral sex on their partners if they have oral hsv 1 like should every person who’s been intimate with someone who gets cold sores assume they have it genitally? ### Ah Im sorry I read that wrong as being because of herpes and did assume. The rest of what I said stands though. If results and symptoms don't point to you having it I don't think you should worry. And sex of course can still be safe if you do and doesn't need to be avoided as for whatever else you are thinking could give it to someone you'd want to date like kissing. ### No. It's too soon, and it might have missed a previous infection. ### Okay great you should closely monitor for symptoms for the next month or two. After which you can forget about it ### There is no way to tell whether you have it orally or genitally unless you have symptoms. At least to my knowledge. 

As far as symptoms appearing soon after contraction, that might be true in some cases, but definitely not universally true. There are married people who post on the sub that say they’ve been married for years, don’t suspect cheating, and have their first symptoms seemingly out of nowhere, likely triggered by stress. Sometimes one tests positive, assumes the other is cheating, and yet the other tests negative. 

I’ve definitely received oral from people with ohsv1 because I wasn’t aware that cold sores were herpes. They didn’t have symptoms, so I didn’t contract it. 

Having sex, oral or penetrative, with someone who is herpes positive, type 1 or type 2, doesn’t guarantee transmission. There’s a higher chance during an outbreak, and still a small chance without symptoms, but sex with someone HSV+ =/= transmission. ### Do you happen to have genital hsv 1 or 2? If u don’t mind me asking.  I’m just curious because you said you had caught it from someone who had it asymptotically orally ### Okay so do you think it’s necessary to be tested for it ? How should I go about it ### Well it’s been 10 months since we’ve broken up so ### Do you think I should get tested or no ### I don't mind at all. I have ghsv1. Just getting through my first outbreak. ### I wouldn't bother unless it's part of routine testing or you get symptoms. 

Honestly, I wouldn't worry at all about this. ### Not at all in that case ### Did you Immediately start to have symptoms after you contracted it or do you think it layed dormant for awhile and just popped up? Did the person know they had a history of cold sores ### It was ONS but when I messaged them to get tested they didn't seem to be aware that they could have it. It was definitely them I was neg before and I had symptoms a week later. I slept with one other person in that time period but we used protection and it was too close to when my symptoms developed so wasn't enough time for it to be them.

There's one other person it could have been to be fair. I just feel like I know. If it was the other one then it laid dormant for a month and then symptoms were triggered by rough sex and developing a UTI potentially. ### ",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tjpoet/i_really_need_advice/
tj4iur,"This just in: HSV makes us... stronger😉🙂 Soooo, I just watched this video that discusses a study on how mice infected with HSV were better at warding off other infections. Not sure how it translates to human, buuut it did make me feel good! Keep your head up homies:)

tjk9nt,"Please help, I’m so confused… Sorry, This is extremely long but please read to fully understand.. 

So, to start, I was with my partner for 2 years and we broke up. We didn’t have sex for 3 months at least prior to the break up..after breaking up with him, I went back to my child’s father and we slept together (roughly) - fast forward 8 days, I started noticing bumps. My vagina was obviously torn from the roughness of the sex, but these bumps were not blisters and were not located in the inner area where the tears were. Plus, They never burst, never caused me any pain other than when i wiped at them and kind of palpated them to see what they were. They were around my clitoral/outer labial area and nowhere near the inner labia or vulva. I went in to get “swabbed” because I popped what looked an ingrown hair and thought maybe it could be swabbed anyway. 7 days later, I get a positive IGG for herpes 1 and 2, index 1.5 for hsv2 and 1.1 for hsv1. The swab was negative. Tell child’s dad about this because I thought he gave it to me. He tested negative for hsv1&2 a week later. So now, I’m thinking wtf?, my ex boyfriend gave it to me?? He has not been tested and won’t because he hasn’t had any symptoms, which pisses me off. 

Anyway, this “outbreak” lasted all of 5 days MAX. Like the symptoms were over before I tested positive. and never ONCE did I experience a popped blister or painful urination in the vaginal area other than the first couple days after the rough sex due to tearing. I was prescribed Valtrex and when I tell you I reacted BADLY. SEVERE Back spasms, nausea and vomiting, horrible vertigo, etc. as soon as I stopped taking them at the end of the script, I stopped reacting.

So, I go get tested again, this is about the 3 week mark since the “outbreak”. This time I asked for another swab, a second IGG, and my doctor threw in a blood PCR test which I hear is useless, but whatever. PCR and swab came back negative, but IGG came back positive for hsv2, index 1.2 and hsv1 was equivocal right at 0.9 - weird, right?? 

So NOW, fast forward to a couple days ago I was ending  my period and those bumps appeared again, with itching and yeasty discharge. So I do a telehealth visit and they prescribe me yeast infection pill and Valtrex for 6 days worth. The bumps disappeared after I started the yeast pill but I am still taking the Valtrex just to be safe. I am so sick from it, it makes me wonder wtf I am even taking it for. 

So sorry for the long post, but WHAT THE HELL is going on? My doctor is not giving me any answers except “you definitely have a herpesvirus, but not sure what type/location, and just disclose to people you might have it.” MIGHT? Is there not a damn YES OR NO? Like what do I do??? Someone please help my mental health is suffering because I just want to know what is going on, I know the stigma against the virus is ridiculous and it’s more common than we know, I’m not worried about that. I just wanna know what I should be disclosing and more importantly where the hell did I pick this up if my last sexual partner tested negative, and the one before that was 3 months ago with no outbreak until January and a low positive??? Like wtf",9,2022-03-21 15:47:54-04:00,"From the details you provided and having had had a cold sore in the past, you have hsv-1 which could be triggering a false positive hsv-2 result. There’s a lady named Terri warren (she’s a nurse practitioner I believe) who does a lot of research on hsv and she provides a western blot (golden standard test) for persons will low positives. It cost a few hundred but it would be worth it if you need confirmation. ### IgG are super low which could be a false positive…symptoms are tricky which I would suggest that once you get these bumps get them swabbed ASAP, typically between 24-48 hours in appearance if you haven’t done so before. It’s going to be OK babe, I promise. These blood test are so shitty that the only accurate one out their is the western blot & a swab test. 

Have you ever had cold sores by any chance? ### I will also add that these bumps look like Fordyce spots and/or pimples. They are never filling with clear fluid and have never popped. Like I know everyone is different and has different symptoms, but I really don’t get it… ### Omg really?? Is there a link for this??? ### Okay I’ll make sure to try and get them swabbed again next time!

And honestly, I have had 1 cold sore in my life and I got it because I was on drugs and picked my lip open with someone’s blackhead tool.. so I gave it to myself and that is the only time I’ve ever had a cold sore ### Look up westoverheights dot com ### I think that’s a good idea babe, try to ease your mind. 
& also you can’t trust that person on their results unless they actually showed them to you. Keep in mind HSV isn’t included in panels and usually you have to request it separately. I hope all goes well. ### Thank you so much!!❤️ and yeah it was a whole thing telling my kids dad because he literally admitted himself to the hospital and was suicidal because he thought I gave it to him.. so he definitely got the blood test and was negative but as for my ex boyfriend I don’t know ### Dang, that’s rough. Wow! 

You’ll be OK, it’s not the end of the world and I’m glad your staying positive! Keep us posted. I’m just a msg away. ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tjk9nt/please_help_im_so_confused/
tjetb1,"Chin HSV2 with a little panic So I'm sitting here working and my chin starts to itch. I have a beard and sometimes that happens so whatever. I scratch it. It just gets worse so I go check it out... 

A bunch of little clear blisters. 

Wtf. I have had HSV2 genital only for a couple years and this is new... 

What worries me is I rested my chin on my toddlers head multiple times this past week and gave them kisses, 2 or so days ago they put my beard comb in their mouth, and i put eye drops in their eyes all day yesterday and I wasnt being mindful and washing my hands every 5 seconds as I typically do. 

I take daily suppressants but we were sick all weekend and now I'm reeling going through every moment to see if there is any possibility I spread this to them, weighing probability, determining odds if it was there but no blisters yet. 

Fuck this virus man 

Edit from my crosspost: 

I'll obviously know if they get it within a few days but to help ease my mind until then does anyone have any resources on lesion development time or transmissibility? 

I started getting a sore throat yesterday so I assume I at least had a small red patch there. 

Super sore throat and blisters today. 

They put my beard comb in their mouth for half a second before I snagged it on Friday although I don't think I had used it any time right before they did that. 

I did give them forhead kisses yesterday and we snuggled all day Saturday with some chin resting on their hair. 

I put eye drops in their eyes all day yesterday so i'm hoping I wasn't scratching my chin with the hand that touched their eyes but I don't think there were blisters yet otherwise it would have been as itchy as it is right now.",8,2022-03-21 11:47:11-04:00,"You've had ghsv2 for a couple of years, which means you have very well established antibodies to protect you from getting it in another location on your body. I'd be very surprised if this is hsv2 on your face. 

Perhaps it's hsv1, but it's far more likely to be some kind of dermatitis since it's in your beard, or folliculitis. Go to an urgent care today and get it checked out. Since your kids have been all up in your things, and you've been cuddling, etc., you want to make sure it's not some kind of MRSA or something that will make them sick. 

Go today. Make them culture it for herpes and for bacteria. Let us know. ### Go get tested. The only non sexually way it would transfer is if you touch your genitals and then your chin. 

It would probably transfer easier with an open wound. ### I'm not sexually active so the odds I got a new virus would be real weird. My chin has itched incessantly in the past here before so it very well could be that I've always had it but this time it's a much larger area.  
  
I highly doubt it's not HSV. I have faliculitus on my chest when I shave, I don't get shiny red skin and 5 or so clear blisters grouped together that itch like crazy.  

  
I did just look up dermatitis images and yeah, maybe. But what are the odds it would be accompanied with a sore throat.  
 
Edit: And thanks for the reply! ### Could be that during an outbreak I scratched in my sleep and then scratched my chin. Not unheard of.  
  
The chin is such a weird spot though. I don't have time to step away from work to go get tested and it's not like I would be surprised by the results anyway.  
  
I'm more concerned with if my beard limited skin to skin enough that my toddler didn't get it or hoping that even if there were no blisters the past couple of days if I scratched and touched him whether or not he would get it.   
  
Forehead kiss? Probably not. Beard comb, I doubt it. ### Follow up, I know one of the blisters popped when I was scratching and the 2 others are now gone. It's been like 2 hours? Weird. Still red, shiny, and very itchy ### You are around children. It could be impetigo, hand, foot and mouth disease, strep/scarlet fever, or any number of things. 

The odds that you got hsv2 on your chin are just as weird as you getting hsv1 there. Really, go get it checked. ### I appreciate it but my kiddo would have shown symptoms in all of those first and they did not. Plus this looks and feels like HSV. It's pretty distinct.  
  
I am instead going to be mindful of this spot now in case of any future flair ups.  
  
My main concern was around lesion development time as I think that is the most probable way I would've passed it. That or if I scratched and then did their eye drops. I did stay away from the mucus membranes and wiped with a baby wipe after so I doubt I passed it.  
  
I'm probably just freaking out because it's new ### How would you have gotten hsv2 on your face? Have you had an outbreak lately? 

You said you were sick all weekend - what were you sick with? 

An hsv2 outbreak wouldn't heal this quickly. 

But if you want to believe that's what this is, even just so you'll be careful - go for it. ### ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tjetb1/chin_hsv2_with_a_little_panic/
tjdf72,"Fucked myself (M28) for life I'm not sure, maybe I should've posted this to r/vent, but I thought the people here might have some truthful insight. This weekend I had a bit too much to drink and willingly had sex with a GHSV-2 positive woman. She properly warned me and I still did it, without proper protection. This was maybe the second time I've met her, and I risked it all for one night. I've got pretty much all the prodrome symptoms, and I'm going to the doctor today. I understand how you would cope if getting herpes was something that happened by accident, but I did this to myself. I feel like a complete idiot, and can't get over the fact that I did this to myself. I have myself and only myself to blame. I guess I'm just curious if anyone had a similar situation, and how to cope, because I feel like a total piece of shit who fucked up the rest of their life for some mediocre sex.",22,2022-03-21 10:44:57-04:00,"I'm sure this is what a ton of people here might say, but seriously it's nothing to worry about. It's at most a skin condition, it won't kill you or your chances at dating at all. I was absolutely mortified when I got it and thought life was over. I did some research into what causes flare ups, and how to avoid them. At that point it essentially becomes a super power, it helps you understand when you're not at your healthiest. I've had a few bumps here and there questioning if it'll be an outbreak, but in the 3 years since my first ob, I've only had one, and also met the love of my life on a dating app. (Not everyone is this lucky unfortunately). 

It helps you find the sincere people so easily, because a good person won't care if you occasionally get some pimples down there. I've had people react grossly and I just write them off as someone who's opinion I don't care about. 

All in all, do some research, get a really good understanding of what it is and how it effects you. Look into getting treated medically for it if necessary, there's medicine that can help reduce the outbreaks. There's vaccines and cures in the works, most likely within our lifetime, if that's something that ends up being necessary for you to hope for. Definitely read previous stories on this subreddit and you'll see time and time again, people either are ready to give up on life because of it, or they've lived through it and see it's an extremely insignificant part of life. ### I feel the same regret man. It’s best to not look back too much. Because that regret really will Kill you. 

Just move forward and try to remove any stigma you feel in your mind. And look at the statistics of how many people Havethis. ### Think about how chill you were knowing she has HSV. That’s the reaction I’ve gotten from everyone I’ve ever disclosed to. And it made me pickier about who I wanted to be with ### I dont think you'd get it that fast ????? Maybe you don't have it. ### That's a pretty wild thing to do not gonna lie...That being said whats done is done. You just have to live your life and be optimistic if you indeed have herpes. ### It’s not that big of a deal and it’s just sex ### Thank you for the response, this did help. Glad this sub exists. I've just been thinking about how different my life will be now - I finally had moved to a new area after covid and was excited to finally get back on the dating scene, but I messed it up. I understand medically what it is and that it really isn't a big deal, but the unfortunate reality is that people will see me differently because of it, whether it's warranted or not. I agree with the other comments/stories on here that the stigma of herpes is really what causes issues. However, I don't think that the public view of herpes will ever change, until like you said, there is some type of cure/vaccine for it.

TL;DR - Thank you for the advice! I still think my life will be very different/inconvenient, but I guess it's something I have to deal with. ### What would you say causes the flare up ? An you said you’ve only had a couple of outbreaks do you take the medication everyday ? ### I think its harder for guys to get it too so maybe there's hope you don't have it ! Was she having an outbreak? ### It's one of those things that only experience will be able to provide the comfort and answers you're looking for. It really bothered me for a few months, but then I met my girlfriend and she was just like ""oh ok, well pretty much everyone has it in one form or another and you're still you"". That moment for me was a lot of clarity I needed to hear and experience. Since then I don't even really think about it at all at this point. It's truly no more intrusive in your life than a big ol pimple on your face may be. Ya it's a Lil gross, but if someone makes you feel bad for something literally everyone goes through in some form (skin irriation/pimples) then fuck em! I wish for the best for you truly! Times have changed a lot since even I initially got it 3 years ago, but stay confident in yourself, and if you weren't, then find that confidence! You're still the exact same person you were before, now with even more awareness and experience. Don't let it define you or your life. The right people won't bat an eye when you mention it and those are the people you want to be friends with. It's a great judge of character. 

Seriously, I found myself using that diagnosis as a way to exemplify the negativity in my life. I wasn't confident prior to getting it, so getting it absolutely destroyed my confidence. Maybe try working out, doing something YOU care about and getting good at it, eating right, could all be options to feeling healthier. It sounds so dumb from your end I'm sure, like oh of course, take care of myself thanks. 

I just bring this all up because my diagnosis, although life ruining at first, turned me into an extremely confident person as I tried to fix it by maxing out my other stats. It's not a bad thing unless you structure your thoughts into thinking it's a bad thing. This could be life providing you a way to spark that fire you needed to do what you always wanted. The first outbreak is also always so so so much worse than the rest. My first was horrendous, now it's no different than just a little razor burn.

Sorry for ranting, that's all just assurance I would've loved to have gotten before. Try to keep your head up and look for the positives in the situation. Just because other people in life deem it as a bad thing doesn't mean you can't deem it a good thing. Good luck my friend! ### I'm lucky enough that my outbreaks have never been severe enough to warrant the prescription (outside of the first one). There's a specific list of foods to avoid, but in general its just avoid fatty unhealthy food. Surprisingly though I've heard broccoli can increase outbreak chances but I still eat it lol. I think of it as something that's a little more sensitive than normal acne. 

The way I think of it is that it's essentially just acne that triggers a little easier than normal acne. If eating greasy foods, drinking milk, shaving etc cause acne normally, it'll cause flare ups even easier. If a lifestyle change has helped you remove acne in the past, it'll likely help here. Also in general keeping as strong an immune system as you can, since it is a virus. Staying healthy in general is definitely a good preventative. My second worst outbreak was rather recently and I definitely attribute it to be Hella lazy and eating a ton of junk food for like a month. Thats why it's like a super power, it gives you free motivation to be healthy lol. (This is all just my experience as well, I'm sure others have had very different and more difficult journeys) ### I'm hoping I don't have it, but based the state of my genitals, it's not looking good. I texted her this morning if she was having an outbreak, but she hasn't responded yet. Hopefully she gets back to me before I go to the doctor's office.

EDIT: She said she is not having an outbreak and was not having an outbreak at the time ### So you’ve only had 2 outbreaks in the 3 years you had it ? I ask my dermatologist and primary about what I can do diet wise they said not much you can do . Can I ask how old you are ? ### Update: went to the doctor's office, he said it doesn't look like herpes, but couldn't explain the burning. I have to wait til the lab opens tomorrow to get tested for other STIs ### When you say the state of your genitals would you mind describing? ### Diagnosed at 23, currently 26. I've most likely had many more outbreaks, but I get ingrown hairs rather easily, so any outbreaks that have occurred since diagnosed have been insignificant enough to me to not be able to tell if its an ob or just normal ingrown hairs. At most, I just get a few red spots that are very tiny. In terms of big outbreaks, I had the first one, then one recently where it was clearly an outbreak due to how it spread on contact and noticeably different than normal ingrown hairs. 

The diet stuff I was never sure of, I read that foods with a certain chemical (can't recall the name) can intensify an outbreak, like broccoli or brussel sprouts. I ended up not having any difference either way. 

In general when this happened I switched from eating junk food and being seriously inactive to a completely Mediterranean diet, mostly eating veggies and avoiding red meat. I also ran a few miles everyday. That being an extreme contrast to who I was a before definitely made me feel good and boosted my immune system. A weak immune system is one of the main triggers for an outbreak as well. Again too, this is just my personal experience with it. I cared a lot at first, adopted a super healthy lifestyle (went from 260 to 190), and have since just coasted on that new lifestyle, not really experiencing any issues with hsv nor do I really even remember I have it 99% of the time. I just recently developed /got diagnosed with lactose intolerance at the same time I was eating a ton of junk food and pizza (back up to 220 lol), and at the tail-end of that binge is when I had my second big outbreak.

In general I'd just advise staying as healthy as possible, in whatever way works and feels healthy to YOU. If foods give you stomach aches, or breakouts, listen to your body and don't eat that food. If a part of your body aches, work it out until it doesn't ache the same. Drink a ton of water and stay hydrated. It sounds kind of pseudo-scientific which I hate (I like to know how things work). But it really does work, it eventually becomes almost like a 6th sense and in my experience, really helped me to understand my own body a lot more. ### He did a swab or blood test? A blood test 100 percent wouldn't tell you right away FYI ! ### So I have a burning sensation between my thighs and my scrotum, and it was hard to get a good view, but I'm about 99% sure there are small white bumps forming under my hairs in that area. Also, my shaft has two new red bumps on the right side that have been getting bigger/worse, and I think I'm starting to see white spots at the base of the shaft ### Thank you for the advice .  An as far keeping a healthy immune system . All you can do is eat healthy and hit the gym ? ### Thanks for the info. He said there was nothing to swab, since he didn't think the red bumps I saw were lesions. ### As abstract as it sounds, you are quite literally what you eat. I think eating healthy is certainly the biggest thing you can do to having a good immune system. Working out is the next best thing. Other than that it's more like avoiding certain things; bad air, getting sick, drinking, smoking, too much red meat, etc. Getting bloodwork done can tell you what you may be lacking or consuming that is doing more harm than good. That's not to say I never eat a burger, drink or smoke. I just recommend do everything in moderation and always try to make sure you're getting all of the nutrients you need. Even if you like to eat a lot, eating a lot of nutrient dense food vs plain white pasta or something will be hugely beneficial. ### Definitely going to work on it I appreciate the advice . I had my first ever OB in January right after I recovered from covid . Haven’t had another one yet . Hopefully I don’t for a while . I’m not taking daily medication I’m trying to stay away from it unless I have another OB then maybe I’ll consider taking it daily . ### ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tjdf72/fucked_myself_m28_for_life/

Oh believe me, but if anything I KNOW it is possible to live that normal healthy life we are looking for. It will be different and it will feel frustrating, but all that this changes is having other people be upfront too. It is for your health and theirs I am learning and if you didn’t disclose and ended up getting MORE things you would regret that, wouldn’t you!? This may feel like a curse, but in some ways, I am seeing how I can use it to my advantage and make sure I am safe.

tjfyio,"2nd outbreak in 30 days? Hi all. I had unprotected sex feb 15 with someone I was intimate with in the past, also unprotected, and was seen in the hospital feb 19 for what I thought was only MRSA on my leg and really painful (lower abdomen abs back pain) BV. I did also develop flu like symptoms and extreme muscle stiffness and weakness around the 17th of the month. When I went to the hospital I did have two bumps (looked like possible ingrown or MRSA) on my vulva and requested an std panel. The panel came back positive for BV, mGen, and although the doctor said my bumps did not look like herpes I had a white kind of mucousy discharge and so she gave me valacyclovir to be safe. I’ve finished all of the antibiotics and antiviral 5 days ago and now I have the white mucous type discharge and tingling on my vulva along with this time a few small bumps. I WANT TO ADD THAT I HAD A HERPES BLOOD TEST IN JANUARY AND IT WAS NEGATIVE. so that is why I am a little confused as to what to really think of these symptoms I’m having because I would think if he’s had it and I’ve slept with him in the past wouldn’t my test have been positive? I wanted to wait until the first week of April to go back to the doctor for a follow up or TOC swab for the mgen and blood test for herpes but would it make more sense to get the herpes blood test done now while I might be having a possible outbreak?  I did also buy new underwear and feel like it has been constantly pulling at my hair down there, but I don’t want to be ignorant to the fact that I am feeling tingling. I will try to attach a photo. Thanks.",6,2022-03-21 12:37:29-04:00,"Did the dr. not swab the sores you have to confirm the hsv diagnoses ?  Has your partner been tested for hsv ?  Is he positive?  Has he had other partners since he was tested ? The blood igg tests can take a while it come back positive if someone does have hsv , up to 12 weeks .  So testing too soon can miss positive cases. And some people even with OB don’t test positive with igg , misses 30 % of hsv1 & 8 % of hsv2.  If you have been exposed to a hsv + partner it doesn’t  mean you will absolutely become infected , if they aren’t having an OB or virally shedding then the risk is lower. ### Ok doll antibiotic cause yeast infection and yeast infection can trigger OB. If you are positive for HVS then you will have more OB in the first year. Ask for several refills of antivirals so you don’t have to wait around when you get OB. Go get any bumps swabbed and get some meds for the yeast infection. Any time you get antibiotic ask for a subscription for yeast and just take it directly after finishing the antibiotic. It will save you discomfort in the long run. Hope this clears up for you quickly. ### Apparently getting the blood test while you have an outbreak doesn’t make a difference. It can still take ~12 weeks for your body to develop enough antibodies to be detectable. If you can, get the doctor to swab any lesions as soon as possible (recommended within 48hrs). I’ve also read you have to be off the antivirals in order to get accurate results from the blood test. ### The doctor did not because the bumps were not open sores or blistered. He said he has nothing but I don’t know him well enough to trust him entirely and yea he has had multiple partners between the last time we were intimate. I’ve read that testing too soon can miss and that testing with no OB can miss. Is that true As well? And if I was exposed to it from him in February than it sounds like it would be best to just wait a few more months then. ###  Thank you. ### You can be exposed and not actually catch and yes test 12 weeks post exposure , not 100 % but good to know regardless. Best always to have confirmatory swab. ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tjfyio/2nd_outbreak_in_30_days/
tj0w5r,"I feel horrible after not disclosing I feel absolutely terrible. I have ghsv1. I was drunk and hooked up with someone with no protection. I've disclosed in the past but I don't know why I didn't say anything this time. We started kissing and things got out of hand really fast. I don't know what to do. I feel like a horrible person. I'm hoping they don't get any symptoms within the next week. Should I call them and have a convo about it? Should I wait and see if they get symptoms first? How should I handle this? Has anyone been in a similar situation? I don't know what's wrong with me. I feel like a scumbag.

Update: I reached out and called her to talk about it. She hates that I didn't disclose to her at first. She would've found a way to work around it if I was upfront and honest but I broke her trust. Eventually she said she forgives me but she has to think about if she wants to ever see me again :(",33,2022-03-20 22:04:52-04:00,"You are talking about hsv1 a virus 80% or more people already carry. The fact that it's genital makes the risk of transmission incredibly low. Any person engaging in casual sex should know there are risks involved. If you are positive for HIV or Hepatitis or some other potentially life threatening disease.  Then yes disclose. But herpes??? No. Ridiculous.  I guarantee whoever you hooked up with already has it. Do not call them for christ sakes. Honestly the ONLY A reason you feel guilty is bc we live in a puritan society where anything on your genitals is considered ""bad"" if you had that same virus on your mouth , where it's ten times more contagious no one would expect you to disclose.  Just reread your post. They didn't even ask you to wear a condom? Clearly this chick ain't that concerned about stds ..please ask her to get tested and in the future ask partners to get a test before disclosing.
Just read your update. She sounds really uneducated . If she doesn't already have hsv1 * which I guarantee she does) and she's that concerned about it ,she needs to pull a Howard Hughs and isolate in her basement the rest of her life. ### At the end of the day, with most things in life, you have to treat people the way that you would want to be treated. 

If the shoe was on the other foot, what would you want her to do? ### I have not a bunch of great info so I’m sorry this happened and I’m sorry i can’t help more, but please know the fact you know what you did was morally wrong on your compass is good. Things happen, like how things happened to get us here. Learning from it is what will make or break it all. ### I’ve been in a very similar situation. Hooked up with a girl a few months ago, also very drunk, no protection. We found out she’d contracted hsv-1 a week later. I felt so awful and came clean to her on the spot. She was pissed obviously. I still feel like I’ve committed a crime against humanity or something, but we’ve had constructive conversations since. Make sure you’re supportive in any way you can be. I think making sure your hu knows that you are genuinely compassionate and understanding of the situation she may be in goes a long way. Also, I don’t know if this applies to you, but as a college student, I’m probably drunk more than I should be and my incident really made me reflect on the way alcohol affects my judgement. Being drunk does not excuse giving someone herpes, but it is never a bad thing to know yourself, especially if that will help you avoid doing anything like this again. ### I'd call them. It would be sooo difficult to but I would ### Love to you 🥰 ### It's a difficult subject to bring up, especially if you like the person. Try not to beat yourself up too much and extend a little grace to yourself. Try reaching out to the person via call or in-person and explain your situation. It's going to be a difficult conversation but letting the person know will allow them to get tested and prevent them from potentially exposing someone else. Or you might find out that they already have it and didn't disclose to you. Either way, being honest with the person may help you forgive yourself as well. 

Best of luck to you. ### Explain the situation truthfully. Tell her that you wanted to tell her before anything got physical but the alcohol made it difficult to slow down and tell you. Just be honest. I can tell you didn’t maliciously do anything to hurt the other person, so just be honest. ### Just read your edit : the fact that you called her speaks to your character. Yes, it’s tough and unfortunate but you didn’t intentionally fail to disclose (like some seem to encourage). You were drunk - not signing legal papers ☺️. I’m sorry this whole thing happened but I hope it works out.  You seem like a good egg. Best of luck. ### Don’t bring it up….she’ll be fine…. ### My friend and I were having a LOOOONG conversation about this the other day. I’ll admit I see it as a pretty grey, complicated topic. There’s so many factors that come into play. After talking to my friend, I never really came to a clear conclusion on the right answer, and I still wonder about it all. Just know that I’m there in the same boat as you. Herpes makes my sex life feel 1000x more complicated. Sending you good vibes:) whatever you choose to do, life goes on:) ### A few years ago I met up with a group of my kik friends at a bar fairly regularly.  One night me and two of my girlfriends end up over at one of the guy’s house.  We’re drunk.  Crawl into one bed and the four of us get down. 

The next morning, I’m wracked with guilt.  I send them messagings disclosing. All of them were great about it.  They did say they wouldn’t have hooked up had they known, but they understood that nothing was planned.  It just happened. ### You’re 100% correct. Fuck that double standard shit. If you get oral coldsores you have a potential “std” inside your mouth. No one seems to feel the need to disclose that. ### I totally get where you're coming from. I just feel bad because I actually like this girl and feel like since I knew, I should've at least given her a heads up. For all I know she might already have it and be asymptomatic. It's just a confusing situation. I'm not trying to make it seem like life and death. I just don't want to cause her any unecessary pain/annoyance. ### Based on the science, I would be more worried that I picked up genital herpes from HER than I would be worried that I gave her type 1… ### Hi! Hmm. I might be the only human without HSV 1 or 2? We exist. We’re careful and we don’t deserve to be forced to have a virus without a cure if we extend our trust to someone. Whelp, you reap what you sow - remember that. ### She got it even tho you weren't having an outbreak? ### Must of been oral to genital contact or no? & are you certain she got “hsv-1” ### Agreed you gotta let them know ### Yeah I actually had a great time with this person and would like to see her again. Which basically means I probably need to bring it up at some point and when I do she'll know that I didn't say anything the first time... ### Thank you, that means a lot :) ### This is the funniest thing I've ever read. People who get wasted and have group sex, probably unprotected, not asking about anyone's std status, likely having no idea about their std status, and statistically speaking 3 out of 4 of yall carry hsv1 and 1 carries hsv 2 already , but the next day they want to pretend afterward they care about a cold sore????? You should probably call them all back and let them know you had the chicken pox in 1993 .That could turn into shingles. shit like this is so ridiculous and hypocritical I don't know whether to laugh or cry. ### If I’m understanding the situation correctly, you can make it very clear to her that the chance of transmission is close to zero for this type. 

Tell her some idiot give it to you with a blow job and now the chances of you giving it to anyone, or even having any outbreaks in the future are near zero, but you wanted to mention it to her. 

Make sure you stress the fact that it’s really not even a thing. Because it really isn’t. ### Yea, wasn’t having an outbreak. Not even feeling itchy which usually happens right before (my outbreaks tend to be pretty mild). ### From what I know of ohsv-1 transmission to genitals, it was likely oral yes. And yep she has hsv-1, we are both negative for hsv-2 ### No, you don't. ### I get it, it's hard to have these conversations, especially after a few drinks. I think she'll be more understanding if you tell her sooner rather than later though. ### We actually used condoms with the guy. ### Do you not disclose when you are intimate with a new partner? If they ask for your std results do you show them everything but hsv? ### Ok. Still. I am bisexual,  I've had 3somes/4 somes, I'm not judging you, I'm just really wondering how people think they're never going to hook up with someone who has herpes when more than 80% of people carry it. ### We both get tested then share. So far not one person has been negative hsv1 and 2. Most have 1 ,one had 2.  So yes I disclose but not until I see their results. The stigma exists bc the very small amount of people who know they're positive disclose, people hear ""herpes"" and freak out,  but they themselves aren't aware of their status.  I don't have 1 night stands anymore but people that do should understand there are risks involved. ### I see what you mean, if you’ve been with a dozen people, you’ve likely encountered it multiple times already. You just didn’t know it. ### ",12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tj0w5r/i_feel_horrible_after_not_disclosing/

tjeges,"Recurrent gHSV-1 symptoms I first began having HSV breakouts over two years ago (maybe more like 10 years ago, it's hard to say). After dating a new person for a bit I started to have them regularly. It was a toxic relationship and it messed up my sleep so I blamed that. Since then I've been having regular breakouts and was assuming it was HSV-2 for that reason. The igg blood test showed positive for HSV-1 (50 igg) and negative for HSV-2. So I can be assured that it is HSV-1 I think, but I'm surprised I'm having such regular breakouts every 3-4 months.

I'm taking valtrex regularly and the symptoms are very small these days. I also take lysine and other multivitamins and I'm otherwise very healthy.

This is a copy/paste of my disclosure advice to someone

Disclosing is the main time herpes sucks. You can do it face to face, by text, over the phone… however you feel most comfortable. There are a couple general rules I follow that have always worked for me.

Work your disclosure into a conversation. You’re waiting on your moment. If he shares something personal, be supportive & then share about herpes.

Be short, factual, and concise. Don’t word vomit facts in one long run on sentence (I have done this before & it wasn’t pretty). Something along the lines of, “since you were open with me, I wanted to let you know that I have the herps. I take meds to keep it under control & prevent transmission & I’ve never passed it on,  Ask me whatever you’d like & ill always be open & honest about it”    Or , since this is more casual, “ask me whatever you want but I promise the sex will he hotttt” . Open the door to him asking questions about statistics or more details. Closing with something dirty will usually make them forget everything else you just said. Men are easily distracted by sex 😂

Just suggestions. All disclosures are different based on your relationship to the person & what the goal of the relationship is ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tjd5nx/disclosing/
tj2wct,I think having herpes is like saying i have ____ disease/illness/syndrome/paraplegic (idk how to properly say it). People still shy away from people with other issues. Dont worry so much!  We’ll find the right person who will accept us for who we are. :),12,2022-03-20 23:55:22-04:00,"____ = Acne ### When I was first diagnosed I literally took it as a death sentence.  As if I had just be diagnosed with HIV . That was 7 years ago and I've come a loooong way lol. I simply see it now as a skin condition. And all the men I've disclosed to don't care lol. ### :( ### That’s the closest comparison to me, a minor skin condition that comes and goes. 

HSV is much less noticeable, and while almost every woman I’ve dated has experienced acne at some point my current partner is only likely to experience HSV if she’s with me for 25yrs+ because I take my daily antivirals. ;) ### What would you compare it to? ### Eczema? Psoriasis? ### Even being with you for 25 years she probably still won’t experience hsv ### No i meant youre right and its sad ### Random thought, But I haven’t had an Eczema break out ever since getting HSV ### Yes, I suspect the vaccine or cure will come to the rescue well within 25 years! ### Woah amaZing ### Lucky!

tiuh4c,"I'm worried our ""safe"" spaces are for fetishizing our own sadness and feeding into the stigma This is a little bit of a rant but sometimes if ""herpes positive""(no pun intended) spaces like this subreddit and PositiveSingles and others are healthy or if we're just feeding into the stigma and isolating ourselves. We have internalized the idea that carrying this very common and *for the most part* benign virus makes us unloveable contagious freaks and we withdraw into ourselves. I question the usefulness of these spaces for depressed newly diagnosed folk when almost everybody else is lamenting and catastrophizing their condition. Instead of supporting and educating each other alot of times we are validating each others shame and inadvertently justifying the extremely overblown stigma placed on us. Don't get me wrong, I have learned alot and have benefitted immensely from this subreddit and other herpes communities but I think we should be careful about if what we are saying is productive or if we're fetishizing our own stigma and status. We are the ones who have to live with this virus we should be cultivating a space based on supporting, educating each other, debunking the stigma, and living a fulfilling life full of love and happiness. Maybe I am being insensitive and I strongly dislike toxic positivity we should be able to understand each other's sadness and providing solutions instead of feeding into it. These are just my thoughts. I will have another post all about positive singles.",5,2022-03-20 16:46:50-04:00,"i enjoy having a place where i can catastrophize without it affecting others' judgement of me. like, i dont want to talk about how unlovable i am with my friends, because that will further the stigma much more than commiserating with others who have self defeating thoughts. the thing is though, we have to recognize that we are commiserating. we shouldnt accept the negative thoughts, but its okay to share them. I can definitely see your frustration; the negativity can get extreme. i'd like to see a better balance. ### I agree ### Yep 100%.   I have stopped reading here (and the FB group) because of this.  I only focus on the cure/research sub if I read anything at all.  On days i feel immune to the negativity I may peek in here.  

One girls comment here last week really stuck with me.  She was talking about how she and her boyfriend have had unprotected sex for like six years and he’s never gotten it from her, because she simply avoids having sex when she senses prodrome coming on. 

And it’s been 100% successful.  

A bunch of people warned her that she’s still a walking “asymptomatic shedder” no matter what and she replied:   

“Lol.  People around here really hate themselves”. 

I get where both sides are coming from, but at the end of the day, despite what some of the studies say, I’ve lost count of the number of people who have managed to avoid giving it to partners by simply paying attention to their bodies. ### I honestly feel like there should be a separate sub for that though.  

I have participated in several other chronic health condition groups and the majority of them focus on medical and alternative ways of fixing the fucking problem. 👍🏼 Sharing stories and anecdotes and tips and tricks for improvement and getting back to life. 

Because at the end of the day that’s the only way you actually feel better. This unfortunately is one of those subs where I can’t find a single person talking about that stuff. 

It’s probably because most people here are newly diagnosed and those who have chronic outbreaks. But that’s why maybe there should be a separate sub for them. ### This sub is so negative and toxic sometimes. It's like it's full of people who hate themselves and have given up on life and love and want to feel vindicated by that decision so they want to bring everybody down with them.

tja67u,Outbreak after sex with a certain partner; no one else. My Ex gave me herpes and lied about over a year ago; I broke up with her in September and have had a healthy sex life intermittently with about 5 people since. I disclosed none had any symptoms and I never had an outbreak since my first one; no medication but I kept a close eye. Some people I had multiple times with; nothing on either side. The girl I’m seeing now has flared me up pretty much instantly both times I’ve had sex with her afterwards. She hasn’t been tested for herpes though. Although had some unfortunate things occur when she was a bit younger she’s worried she might have got it then; before I was in-the picture. Is there reasoning behind this?,1,2022-03-21 08:01:31-04:00,"Even before diagnosis I would get flareups of some kind down there after sex with only one girl. Her PH was very acidic, or something. Maybe slightly higher bacterial load. I don’t know what it was. 

But there’s definitely something in vaginal fluid that irritates guys sometimes. My other ex? Sex 100 times a day and never got a single bit of irritation. 

The first girl? Every single time, I would spend a week with an irritated urethra afterwards.  No herpes for either of us. ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tja67u/outbreak_after_sex_with_a_certain_partner_no_one/

tj8veq,"Quick Question about The Herp hi guys, I have a quick question about herpes, specifically HSV-1, as I haven't been able to find answers online.

As we all know, HSV-1 is also referred to as cold sores when we have it in the mouth. Curious about this scenario:

If I have HSV-1 but asymptomatic  and I kiss someone, this means that I am still likely to pass it to them, correct?

From my understanding of herpes, both HSV-1 and HSV-2 generally prefer ONE area of the body. So for instance if first point of contact is this one particular area (either mouth or genitals), the virus reoccurs in that particular body part only. Correct?

So, let's say I've passed it to them via mouth to mouth - this means the virus has been exposed to that specific area, therefore meaning that the body has already started building antibodies for the virus. Which means that if first point of contact is the mouth, they are not or less likely to get it on the genitals...? am I correct to say this?

This is taking into account gap in time between kissing and performing oral sex on partner, about a week or two.

In summary, my question is basically this:

I have HSV-1 but asymptomatic. Kissing partner on one occasion will have exposed them to the virus in the mouth and given body time to create antibodies. Does that mean that my partner would have developed a resistance towards the virus in the genitals (meaning they don't have HSV-1 in the genitals, just the mouth).

Thank you for your time if you come across this!❤️",5,2022-03-21 06:42:07-04:00,"Only if you were shedding when you kissed them. Asymptomatic means you’re unlikely to be shedding (still entirely possible though) kiss them while symptomatic to be sure. Yes you were correct with everything else ### As for you OP, people have been in relationships for years, kissing their partner for years, and still end up giving them ghsv1. Me for example, I probably had a month of some really deep make-out sessions with my ghsv1 gifter before they gave me oral for the first time, and the first time they gave me oral is when I contracted 🤷🏽‍♀️ it’s all just about the luck of the draw. That’s why when you’re disclosing you should be telling people that your hsv1 can transmit to both the genitals and the mouth… because a lot of people aren’t aware it can go down there ### Do you think hsv1 really prefers to stay oral? I know that’s the general “knowledge” that’d been stated for years but I don’t think the statistics support it. 50% of new genital cases are hsv1. 

HSV2 on the other hand statistically prefers genital. ### Yes hsv2 really does preference genital. 
Hsv1 I really don’t think has a preference BUT if it’s contracted genitally, outbreaks are much less frequent and much less severe
(Just regurgitating what I’ve read btw) ### I think hsv1 is just so common that we see it a lot more, it has nothing to do with the “preferred location” (its a virus that like wet, warm, moist areas that’s all that matters.) When you pair that with the fact that most people are not getting oral hsv1 in childhood anymore it makes sense why we see way more ghsv1 cases than we do ghsv2 or even ohsv2 cases. ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tj8veq/quick_question_about_the_herp/
tipfdd,"Just tested positive for HSV2 So this week has been hard for me (18M), and it’s been a lot of ups and downs. Last Monday a cold sore popped up. Me a hypochondriac, got a Covid test, and a full std panel and it came back positive for herpes. My doctor said my case was interesting because I only got one bump as it’s usually in clusters for people, so my case could be a once in life time thing, but no one is that lucky. I told my grandparents, mom, and friends and they all responded well, but I still feel dirty. I’m still processing it and trying my best not to still believe the stigmas even though most people will stigmatize it, and I know this will cause guys to stop talking to me, but I’m praying that it doesn’t affect my love life with guys and regular life.",58,2022-03-20 12:57:07-04:00,"Oral hsv2 is so rare and its like almost impossible to spread. As far as disclosing,  do NOT tell any potential partner until they have had a full panel std test and you SEE the results..most people carry hsv 1 or 2 and most have no idea. ### I tested positive back in October.  Same feelings.  I just started dating again and decided to put it out there in my profile.  I have gotten very positive feedback and gone on a few dates despite it.  Hang in there.  More people have it than you realize. ### Fyi one pump now doesn't mean you won't get many clusters of bumps, the virus can cause varying pumps on each new outbreak ### It’s rare to have oral hsv 2 only. Usually people contract genital and oral around the same time. If you recently acquired this, you’re still very vulnerable to genital hsv 2 and you shed it orally a lot in the beginning. 

Oral hsv 2 will give you some protection to HSV1 and 2 in other locations. ### I just got an STD panel and requested herpes be done. I cam back negative for hsv1 and 2. I was shocked because I have had cold sores. Never a cluster just on on my upper lip maybe 3 times on 10 years. If you ask someone to take STD test you have to tell them.to request a herpes test since it isn't standard. ### 1 in 5 people carry the virus, most people don’t even know they do. it’s so common. i just got diagnosed with ghsv1. i’m in the same position. 
it’s almost unfortunate to show symptoms because that means you know you have it and then have the burden of telling future partners.

i don’t think a cold sore is a big deal. as long as you keep an eye on symptoms :) and don’t have contact until fully healed

oh also, it sounds like you have hsv1. which means there’s a good chance it won’t come back! ### You got a confirmatory test ? ### What symptoms did you experience because I suspect i have it too but i just got like one bump at the tip of my penis ### I feel it. I'm 27f I've been hsv1 positive since 17. I have my days as does everyone. But we are not different..this doesn't make us dirty. It just a roll of the dice I guess. But lysine take some daily w ur vitamins and you'll b ok. I find peanuts and shrimp make me flare up but I don't get intense or flare ups often. Only if I eat excessive amount of shrimp n not take my lysin. Chin up buttercup it'll b ok I promise. ### My friend has oral herpes. Don’t know and don’t care the strand but she never has issues with boyfriends. They obviously don’t kiss when she has an outbreak but it’s not something I see her as being self conscious about which is beautiful because on the other hand I have it in my genital area and have been very insecure about it. One thing I can say even still, good peeps love you for you. They love honesty. And everyone loves confidence. You be ok you got this. You’re still gonna rock it. ### Keep disclosing to your friends, family, and new partners and it will get easier. Right now you’ll be reeling but seriously it’s not a big deal. ### [deleted] ### https://youtu.be/NHTniCvTLDY

Most only Carry hsv1 ### Do they ever question why you ask them to get specifically a herpes screening in addition to their std testing? How do you respond? ### Yes. I’m getting tested again just to make sure, but somethings are a little weird. She said I’m protected from hsv2 on my genitals because I got a HPV vaccine, but I could get hsv2 on my lip. And that’s what she is saying what’s happened. ### Sore throat and a lip sore. ### I dont know I don’t even see HSV1 as an issue or something you ever need to disclose. So many people get coldsores and that’s all I see it as. I have HSV2 and tested positive 3 months ago and I’m trying to see it the same way, but I do disclose it to those who need to know. ### Yes! Since my diagnosis I have had 3 guys who swore they didn't have anything  ALL test positive for hsv 1. EVERY SINGLE ONE. One had damn hepatitis b as well. Like are you kidding??? Ppl with herpes are expected to be the moral saints telling everyone they have it without expecting anything in return. I have always been adamant about testing even before I got a hsv 2 diagnosis and in my experience the very few guys (late 20s to early 30s age group) who had tested before I asked them to , had never got hsv testing bc it's not included. ### AMEN 🙏🏽 🙌🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 ME too!! ### Yeah that’s 100% wrong. I had the HPV vax and I have hsv2 on my genitals. Sorry you were misinformed. ### No hpv & hsv are 2 different virus.  One has nothing to do with the other. Who said that , your Dr?  You can get hsv2 orally ( on your lip though more rare ) or genitally , but nothing g has to do with your vaccine for hpv. 

If you have hsv2 then you may be protected against getting hsv1 .  Though up to 70% of us have hsv1 and usually before getting exposed to hsv2.

Did the Dr. swab your sores ?  And was it positive? ### Honestly I disclose because of how it happened to me. I got hsv1 on my genitals and lips. My first outbreak was so excruciating. But that was mainly the only time I had a severe one. I disclose my hsv1 cuz even tho it isnt ""that bad"" it was for me. ### [deleted] ### I’m with you guys here. Many on the sub don’t agree but fuck it. I tested negative at 5 weeks but still suspect I have something. 

And honestly I don’t want to fucking know. The cdc recommends not testing if there’s no symptoms for a reason.  Especially with ghsv1 on the rise because of oral sex. 

It’s weird that this is the first time I’ve seen this perspective on this sub but like I said.  As far as I know I don’t have it. But I’m not checking again. Unless it’s clear as day in my face ### My sore didn’t produce any pus, and I’m just going if what she said, so I will get tested again. It’s just so many things are being told to me. ### This is what the CDC /government wants , I'm convinced.  My sister was pregnant, PREGNANT and said her husband had hsv1 and she wanted a test and they refused.  They said there's no medical reason for it. I think they want everyone to eventually get it . ### That’s just like me man I did something stupid i’m 18 n for some reason was going crazy for hooker porn then one day i was like fuck i should do it so i just got oral from her with a condom. As far as i know man i am clean i didn’t kiss her nothing n her mouth didn’t go no where else beside my d . From what i’ve read and everything i’m safe . It’s such a low chance of anything but man it pops up in my head a lot , I’ve got bad anxiety. Like man the day after i fully convinced myself i got herpes didn’t sleep for a couple days . The doctors said as well you don’t know unless they come up and i’ve been so paranoid of the everything but i think safe to say i’m clean. I just wish my anxiety would go. ### Hsv sores / blisters don’t have pus. More like any other blister , clear liquid or yellowish clear liquid. 

Who is the she ?  Your Dr. or gf. ?

Hpv is Human papillomavirus infection (HPV infection, generally we associate it with genital warts & cervical cancer.  

Hsv 1 & 2 is Herpes simplex. Think cold sores either oral ones or genital. ### [deleted] ### WAIT! WHAT???!!! ### No released cure and the treatment cost a ton without insurance, sure they want people to get it. If they didn't they would treat the shit like they treated covid. ### That’s what I’m worried about. Most nurses and doctors refuse to test you for herpes, even if you ask. So when I ask future partners to go get tested, specifically for herpes too, how does that work if they won’t test them? ### Man there’s absolutely no way you could get it that way. 

But ultimately yes. Let’s just not give a shit.  I’m not going to even think about it unless I have giant sores that I can’t ignore. Until then. I got nothing ### My doctor. She isn’t my primary doctor, so I’m getting retested here, then I’m going to my doctor at home. But I she didn’t swab the sore, just my throat ### Can herpes start off as one bump? ### I just got diagnosed today and my blisters did have a more opaque pus because they had become infected. It’s a bit different case by case. ### Probably because HPV can turn into full blown cervical cancer, which it did for me. Thank God for the invasive testing and an amazing oncologist/surgeon, I’m in recovery. ### Yeah bro i’ve been smoking dabs quite a bit again that could be why i always think of it n shit man but forreal man That worrying n shit needs to go ### Yep exactly bro ### You had the sore pop up where exactly ?  And the proper test would have been to swab the actual sore. Once it’s healed all you can get is a blood antibody test but that may only show accurate results at 12 weeks

Not sure how any Dr. could mix hsv and hpv ### It can be a single blister , especially with ohsv1 , everyone i know has only had a single sore pop up. Ghsv not sure , seems like that is more often a cluster. ### You were swabbed or visual diagnoses. ? ### [deleted] ### The sore/ bump was right under my vermillion border. ### Right under my Cupid’s bow ### Im asking because there was this small pus filled pimple that showed up on my tip right near the opening, does that mean herpes because i heared pimples arent herpes ### It was a visual diagnosis but my OBGYN genuinely did not know what else it could be. I’m hopefully on the tail end of my first outbreak so the sores are mainly scabbed over and look more traditional now, but she explained to me because of a preexisting sensitivity I have that they were most likely slightly infected. Still waiting on cultures so I could be wrong but her and the other doctor on call were 99% sure. ### Rash? You are very lucky! For many it’s open ulcered blisters all over mouth/genitals🙁 ### It’s too bad they did not swab the actual sore. Odd they swabbed your throat , you had sores or lesions/  blisters there too ?

You still have the sore to test ?  Most accurate is 24-48 hrs when sore still fresh. ### Hsv doesn’t have pus. Clear or yellow clear liquid. If you have ever had a blister on your finger , foot , seen chicken pox , shingles , it’s more like that type of liquid , like leaky for lack of better word.

But if you actually have something that has appeared then that is the best time to see Dr. & get it swabbed. As soon as it appears. ### [deleted] ### No, but I did have a sore throat. ### Thank you ### Hsv isn’t a rash… it’s horrifically painful open sores. ### >Covid test, and a full std panel and it came back positive for herpes. My doctor said my case was interesting 

So you were diagnosed by the blood test? Was the swab of your throat positive? ### [deleted] ### The throat swab I think. I’m going back to the clinic tomorrow. ### For most it’s not a rash. HSV has destroyed my life. ### interesting they only swabbed your throat and it was positive. what did your cold sore look like? did the dr not think it was hsv at the time? ### [deleted] ### I went 33 years without it because I know so many who suffer from it. I made all partners get tested. Easy to avoid IMO. Then got a selfish one who cheated and didn’t tell me. Oh well. Nothing I can do now. ### [deleted] ### Very easy to avoid. I was lied and cheated and only reason I got it from a massive whore. I make every partner get tested for hsv. ### ",27,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tipfdd/just_tested_positive_for_hsv2/

tio6ot,"happy 1 year herpiversary Tonight will be the one year of my herpes diagnosis. I would admit myself to the ER because I was having chills and I would see blood in my toilet. This lasted for days until I finally decided to go. 

I had a two week long OB, calling out of work sick because I couldn’t relieve myself without screaming and crying from the pain. 

It’s been a wild ride. 

I’ve learned a few things. 

- it doesn’t affect your relationships much. I’ve had two boyfriends since my diagnosis, and they’ve accepted me. 

- it is crucial to work on your self love.

- it’s a blessing and a curse. If someone turns you away because of your diagnosis, good riddance. Know your worth. You are much more than the stigma. 

- take your valtrex - I pop it occasionally when I’m sexually active & it helps relieve some of the anxiety if I feel any prodromal symptoms.

- a lot of people have it. Like, a lot. I know the data says so, but it’s different when you disclose and they say “oh! I have that too” or “yeah! Someone else I know has it” it really helped put it into perspective for me. 

- I have recently stopped participating in hookup culture. sleeping with a stranger after disclosing sends me into a whirlwind of anxiety. Even if I haven’t had an OB in ages and I take my meds. Can’t do it. Nope. I’m good.

However, there’s ways to reduce the risk! I’ve heard of people with HSV taking daily acyclovir to help with suppression. Also, waiting a week after an outbreak heals also helps to decrease the risk. But with that being said the risk is always there, no matter how many steps you take to lower the risk. People with hsv can shed the virus without having symptoms. I think the bigger question is if the risk of having unprotected sex with your partner outweighs you getting hsv. It’s definitely something to think about:) sending you good vibes:) ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tj3q1d/can_you_still_have_unprotected_sex_with_genital/
tiwvhf,If close to 80-90% of people with herpes don’t have symptoms. How do we know how many people actually have it. ,6,2022-03-20 18:39:49-04:00,">If close to 80-90% of people with herpes don’t have symptoms. How do we know how many people actually have it.

From random sampling and testing of the population using highly statistical methods that allow the results to be generalized to the general population with high reliability.

A user made a comment several years ago about how disease prevalence for certain diseases, including herpes, is determined in the US:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/4lagax/i_23m_have_started_dating_a_23f_female_and_last/d3m4z5s

Here are relevant excerpts from the comment:

---

Every 2 years the CDC, as a part of the National Health And Nutrition Examination Survey ([NHANES](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/)), tests a selected group of 10,000 individuals as a representative cross section of the American population. They both interview and perform serological testing so they get to know how many knew they had herpes and how many didn't.

Every 3 cycles they seem to perform statistical analysis produce a report. The latest one of these was the one that found that the average HSV-1 infection rate in the age range 14-49 was 54%. For HSV-2 the average across the same age range was 16%.

This is how they can say with good certainty how many have herpes, including how many that don't know they have it. They are more than estimates, they're derived from proper statistical analysis and the reports are Indeed peer reviewed.

The [1999-2004](http://jama.jamanetwork.com/data/Journals/JAMA/5033/JOC60113.pdf) report has a lot more details than the newer report. It showed that about 30% of teenagers and 65% of 40-49 year olds had HSV-1. 1% of teenagers had HSV-2. In the 40-49 age range it was 18% of men and 33% of women had HSV-2

There is a lot of detail in this report, including reports by gender and ethnic origin. Infection rates can vary a lot in these different groups.

There is a herpes researcher that looked at these reports and estimated that the infection rates of the entire population is about 65% having HSV-1 and 75% having either HSV-1 or HSV-2. ### [removed] ### Thank you. In that post i see there was a study showing they would group together 10,000 participants.  I’m guessing they would just ask them their hsv status. And not actually test them right ?  So they found. 16% of them knew they had hsv-2. 

But the 1-6 is a further estimate since the majority of people with hsv2 don’t know they have it ?

I’m re reading it now and it clearly says that. My mistake. ### Comment removed due to misinformation. Please see my reply to OP. ### >In that post i see there was a study showing they would group together 10,000 participants. I’m guessing they would just ask them their hsv status.

What? No, I very literally just covered that in my preceding comment, I'm not sure how you missed it? The people in the random sample of 10,000 people were asked whether they had herpes as far as they knew, and they were *also* serologically tested (ie blood tested, re blood serum etc). That allowed researchers to not only determine how many of them had herpes, but also how many had it but weren't aware they had it. ### Ohhh. I missed it because I’m slow. I’m sorry. I didn’t know what serologically meant. Assumed it was something else.  

So there’s roughly 60 million in America with hsv2. And that’s as close to the actual amount as we know based off this smaller sample size ? ### ",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tiwvhf/if_close_to_8090_of_people_with_herpes_dont_have/

Just from my experience so far (and also looking at doses online), usually the course of acyclovir is 5-10 days. Maybe you just needed a longer dose? I worked in the OBGYN clinic for a couple of years as a nurse, and sometimes patients came for yeast infections or BV, and we would give them a typical dose of meds. Sometimes they’d come back needing a longer dose. It looks like it *could* be herpes. Sometimes when I get outbreaks I’ll itch a lot and irritate my skin, so it gets murky as to what are actual lesions and what are cuts. But it looks rounded and filled like herpes can look like.

tih3fl,"How many people have actually disclosed to you? I (27M) have been pretty sexually active my whole adult life. I've now only recently (since learning I have HSV2) been more quiet on that front. Throughout that whole time I've been with girls (maybe 70ish partners), I've never once had one of them say to me that they're positive for herpes (in any form), although it wouldn't have bothered me the slightest with facial cold sores. That would go against the statistics massively, so obviously none of these girls would have disclosed or intended to. It's bullshit because I feel so awful now and so anxious about disclosing all the time so as not to have anyone else feel like this. Surely a handful of those women had to have known. It's actually not fucking fair. 

Sorry - needed to rant!",72,2022-03-20 05:10:58-04:00,"Ugh 9 people. I've been with 9 people.. the ones I still have contact with say they are negative.
Never been disclosed to. Also I will say that I've asked my doctor to test for everything, stupidly thinking that meant everything.... 33f just diagnosed this week after my first noticeable outbreak. I have a suspicion of who and when but they blocked my number after we had sex. I got hsv2 at least 2 years ago. ### Im gay and i feel like in the “hookup” scene nobody discloses. easily have been with over 250 men and not a single one has ever disclosed. actually just last week i was at this guys place and found a bottle of Valacyclovir in his bathroom, thought it was funny. I dont rlly care anymore i realized people in this community dont feel the need to disclose which makes me feel a lot less bad the times i don’t disclose. Honestly I usually only disclose if Im having an outbreak or if it becomes more than a hookup or if i feel like it. I know its kinda fucked up but i think its just one of those things ### I’ve prolly had sex with close to 50 girls and not one disclosed to me. My friend has literally had sex with over 500 girls and not one has ever disclosed to him. I’ve had luck disclosing, but if that luck ever changes I’m going to stop. No point in ruining my life over a harmless, stigmatized virus. ### I have been with about 25 men and 6 women , and no one has ever told me they have hsv. Even several who I knew had cold sores as I'd seen them. With the men (after my 2nd and his friend told me he had hpv/genital warts) if it's going to be a refular thing and I want to not use condoms anymore I required mutual testing.  However this usually doesn't include hsv. I was never that worried about it to begin with but i know alot of people say they'd never sleep w someone with herpes, yet they've never been tested,  don't use condoms and never ask partners for a test.  The hypocrisy is absurd. And no, I don't intend to disclose that I tested positive for hsv2. I've never had an outbreak I'm not going to waste my time on people who obviously don't care. , i think.its ridiculous.  I will continue to require negative tests for  chlamydia,  gonorrhea,  syphilis,  hiv and hepatitis before sex. But Herpes?? Lol. Nope . ### No one has ever disclosed to me. I’m 22F. I’ve been with 26 people and I have GHSV2. 
I’m planning on disclosing to people but it’s hard to think about how many people will judge me. I had sex freely before (I will too in the future), but it’s put a strain on that part of me mentally. It frustrates me that it’s expected of me to be upfront and open, when they don’t even ask me or get tested themselves - and most of them try to get out of using condoms (I was always the one pressuring to use it). And then I’m the one who gets it :))

The thing that makes me want to disclose is that I want to break the stigma. I also don’t want to end up liking someone and then having to disclose after multiple rounds of sex/hook ups. It would break the trust. I would be upset if that happened to me too. ### Since I was diagnosed in 2018, I've only had two partners and I have disclosed to both of them. It honestly made me feel better being honest. And they both really appreciated my being open about it. ### 53M, around 90 partners. My first wife kinda sorta disclosed after we were divorced but still friends and co-parents. She called me crying saying she thought she had herpes and asked me to take her to a doctor. 

Like 15 years later I was dating a gal who disclosed after we'd been sexually active for a few weeks. I was somewhat annoyed that she'd waited till then, and she explained that she had been rejected a couple of times, and so had started waiting until feelings started to develop. While considering that in the days that followed, I called the ex-wife and asked her how it had changed her life and she said it hadn't...that she'd stopped disclosing years prior.

A few years after that, a partner and I both got tested as we were considering removing condoms from our routine, and we just happened to be driving together when her doctor called her with positive test results. She eventually transmitted to me (after not taking the daily antivirals we'd agreed would replace condoms), but we're married and spent 15 years ago.

My first disclosure was last night, and a non-issue, but I somewhat intentionally picked someone whose rejection wouldn't really bother me.

Bottom line: 1 partner gave me a real disclosure, albeit a bit late, and I was present when 1 partner and 1 former partner got their diagnoses.  
  
Edit to add: the woman I was with last night also disclosed, in response to my disclosure. ### 24 (F) - I have HSV 2 and honestly I’m on the dreaded medication daily that’s fucked up and altered my taste, I don’t have casual sex anymore, so to me I’m taking a lot of preventative measures. I myself became super educated on it so when the time does come to disclosure I have the facts and confidence to do so. But I guess what I struggle with is my boundaries with disclosure ya know? Because I’d really hate to be really into someone, haven’t done anything sexual and then break the news months later and them freaking out and leaving - resulting in time wasted. The stigma is insane. The guy who had given it to me thought it was included on STD panels and he was asymptomatic and I got it. I can’t even be mad because he didn’t know like MANY people don’t because there is no routine testing and a lot of people are asymptomatic as well as scared to disclose. The double standards of “I’d never sleep with someone with herpes” “herpes is dirty” …but when you confront those same people they have NEVER been tested. I’ve had many people go that route with the sigma (it wasn’t brought up with me having it) and I got really defensive because I’m living it and people have NO idea until it’s you. Sorry to rant on but man I cannot stand the stigma and I’m so disappointed and the lack of education on it. ### All I'll say is fuck people who know they have it and don't disclose. That happened to my current partner and I ache for her daily. Especially considering that we dated prior to her getting it. We took a 6 month break and during that time, the first guy she hooked up after dating me for nearly 3 years gave her hsv2. 

Now I won't say he ruined her for me because she's just as lovely as she ever was, but it has made things difficult in our sex lives. ### 43F. 13 partners. 3 without condoms - all long term relationships. And I am the lucky winner. A guy friend disclosed to me once - he was not a sexual partner though. I have never had to disclose to anyone yet because I dont have sex right now. Lucky number 13 gave it to me. I am pretty sure he knew. POS. ### I had two people I disclosed to tell me they got cold sores after I told them about me. One understood that it was also herpes, but I’m not sure if/when he was ever going to tell me. The other guy clearly didn’t understand that cold sores were herpes, and I wasn’t educated/confident enough to tell him. He was “too scared of getting an STD” and ultimately ended things (no sex was had). 🙄🙄 ### I’ve been with 40 different people but not one disclosed to me too… but ended up getting HSV 2 😔 ### Been with around 100 women. No
one has disclosed anything to me. Never had any other std than hsv2. Surprised I didn’t get anything sooner. I’m 35 ### I disclose immediately because seeing how it has changed the way I do things in life I wouldn’t want to do this to anyone else
Edit: even in non sexual relationships like with my friends every time I even feel a cold sore coming on I tell everyone I am around that my hsv1 is breaking out and to avoid anything my mouth is around ### I had one girl disclose to me that she had hsv1. ### The first person I had sex with disclosed to me & I’ve been with 3 other ppl since who said they had nothing (nobody showed me test results though) & I have tested negative for everything so far ### did you get blood tested or did you have an outbreak swabbed? ### Not one. I’ve had sex with maybe a hundred people probably . Girls and boys. ### 23 F diagnosed last Thursday. When I really count how many partners I’ve had.. orally and penetrative maybe 40? Nobody disclosed. I think it’s a miracle i made it this far honestly. I wish I had been more educated and took the time to learn. ### My ex disclosed she had oral herpes after I disclosed I had HSV2 to her but nobody initiated disclosure. I've had about 10 partners of both sexes. Statistically improbable that I'm the only one with the herp but I have calculated with genital herpes the people who are aware of their positive status is only around 2% so we are in the extreme minority only because we know what we have. ### I'm at 15 people that I know has some form of herpes. Whether it be friends, people that I have hooked up with or family. ### I have had 2 of more than 35 partners (m & f) disclose before intimacy.  Though I was ignorant and unsafe for many years, not asking directly before intimacy for recent test results. ### Absolutely no one. I’m 25 been with around ~30 women, not one has disclosed and most are quick to suggest we forgo protection without any talk of sexual health or sti testing etc. even the “good innocent” girls they’ll be careful first time then after that it’s always “ugh I hate condoms 🥺” can you imagine how many guys would jump at that opportunity to hit it raw? And how many probably have? Makes me sick… Guarantee many of them had/have shit but yeah not one ever disclosed to me 🤷🏽‍♂️ ### One. Who had it and I didn’t get it from her. ### How is it 2 years on ? ### Do you feel guilty if not disclosing? I haven’t been with anybody since my diagnosis and I really don’t want to disclose for casual hookups with condoms… but worried about the guilt. Thoughts on how to deal? ### do you mind if i ask do you have hsv 1 or 2? ### I have a friend who is also gay and he told me he always has unprotected sex. Literally never uses a condom. He’s single and having hookups too. I said what about STIs he shrugged and said “meh if I get something I get something” said no one uses condoms. I know he’s just one guy but that seems to fall in line with what you’re saying too ### if I could try to change your mind; the problem with tops/people doing the penetrating not disclosing is that the person being penetrated is way more likely to contract, EVEN with a condom. also not disclosing directly contributes to the stigma and the fact that herpes exists in the shadows. can we normalize herpes instead of normalizing not disclosing? ### Yeah my buddy who really regularly has group sex told me he’s never been with someone with herpes … I’m like bro that shit is as common as having brown eyes ### Bro I've disclosed twice and it's been fine too, but I agree with you. I mean, ffs, I've never ONCE heard of herpes from anyone until I'M THE ONE WHO GETS IT. And now I'm expected to tell everyone when no one has ever mentioned it to me, any of my friends or even any other guy I've ever met?! It's fucking bullshit. It's obviously everywhere and no one is saying a thing about it. ### I think the point is trying to be better than the person who gave it to you was.

I think what I went through getting it and I would never want to do that to someone unaware of the situation. ### You def got a point ### Thank you for not disregarding her. She is still as valuable as she was, and I loved how you put it!!! ### Mine was 13 too hahhaha ### What is your body count do you mind me asking? ### I was only diagnosed visually by the doc ### And how do you feel about it? Are we kidding ourselves? ### What do you mean? ### no i dont feel really guilty. because for one if you get an std panel herpes usually isnt tested for unless requested, so if the CDC doesn’t think its a big deal then why should I? additionally 60% of people with herpes are asymptomatic and may never know they have it so if were not actively testing AND people are going around hooking up not knowing they have herpes then why am I going to ostracize myself because I have minor visible symptoms that appear very rarely and very shortly

but it also comes down to the fact i don’t believe there are “good people” or “bad people”, I believe that were all on a spectrum and oscillate around fluidly. yeah, not disclosing is bad but I don’t think it makes you a bad person.

but for context i definitely think there are times when disclosure is necessary and your intuition will usually let you know

oh and lastly if someone asks you upfront about it don’t ever lie about it thats extremely fucked up ### honestly idk i never got officially tested but ive had a few anal outbreaks. I have valtrex for if i feel something coming, usually take it for a few days and then I feel fine by day 3/4 ### yeah thats pretty much the general sentiment among people who are having raw sex with strangers lol but definitely a lot of people who only practice safe sex too ### Im a bottom and always have been so. and like i said i’ve never had a top disclose. I think if the goal is normalization of herpes then we shouldn’t have to preemptively disclose unless you feel an outbreak. if you’re worried then always wear condoms or be monogamous with someone because 60% of hsv+ people are asymptomatic and many of those people have no idea they have it because its not being actively tested for during std panels. ### lol ignorance is bliss, until youre breaking out with blisters on your genitals ### Man I feel you. Exactly my thoughts like why does no one say anything. Part of the prob is that if you don't have symptoms people don't test and doctors say no need to test ### No one cares dude. People say they care ,but if they truly did they would demand a negative test before every sexual encounter.  No one does that. The ""you clean? Yep me too"" talk is all people want to hear for false security.  I think if you're hiv positive you should disclose. But herpes? A cold sore???? Lolol that's like disclosing you had chicken pox in 1993. I will never disclose. And these people on this site are the only ones doing that.  Its unheard of IRL . Them they  whine when their hypocrite partner (who's never been tested and has like an 80% chance of being positive themselves) doesn't want to hook up.. ### Honorable point but at what cost? At the cost that you literally get rejected by like everyone you disclose to? At that point what’s even the point in living? 💀 ### 100+ ### did they do any testing? ### I don’t care. I don’t disclose with hookups. ### How is your life 2 years on from diagnosis, how are you doing? And have the OB’s gotten easier and less frequent? ### (34 F, HSV2) I LOVE your reply I feel the same way just found out in January of this year and I’ve disclosed Tia few guys but I feel like you it’s no big deal if they ask I’ll tell and if I “feel” intuitively that I need to tell like if it’s getting serious and unprotected sex in looming around then YES I will if not condoms and I’ll live a happy life #twerkingallsummer2022 🥳 ### Thanks, this helps a lot! And you mean If they ask specifically about herpes or stds in general? ### Yea absolutely. Surprises me how just people in general all seem to be fucking raw my straight friends too male and female it’s crazy ### so would you still not disclose if the sex were unprotected? what about oral sex? don’t you find it the least bit unethical to not even give someone the option to be at risk or not? 

I do agree that it’s different in the hookup community, everyone is always at risk then.

I know that standard STD panels don’t include herpes, but that typically means the people who are diagnosed get outbreaks. which typically means higher viral shedding (sometimes even with antivirals). I just think that warrants a little “hey, I have genital herpes, do you have any questions about that”. ### Yea look it hasn’t been fun.

But those are people I wouldn’t want around me if that’s something that makes them that uncomfortable! 

What happens if you lie and do get with someone and it becomes something. I don’t think i could trust someone that tells me AFTER the fact that they knowingly kept it from me just to sleep with me. 

I understand the frustration. This shit threw me in a total loop and completely fucked up my life. And I’d be lying if I said I didn’t think about doing it too. Just not saying anything and sleeping around again; and then I remember how upset I was that first day and I just can’t do that to someone else without their consent. ### Ffs like this just validates my point. 1 in 100 and she had HSV1. How are we supposed to ruin ourselves? Have you disclosed before? ### None. She just looked at said that it was herpes. ### When you're thinking about more with a person, do you disclose? ### I was just diagnosed this past week.

I had my first ""noticeable "" classic herpes outbreak with sores. I most likely was asymptomatic or very mildly symptomatic that I attributed my symptoms to something else because there were no sores or blisters present. 

Honestly I'm not doing great mentally, struggling really hard. The ob it's self lasted about a week and I just have an itch now. It was a tiny small cluster of 3 very small blisters, they hurt like hell at first because it was on a very sensitive part of me. So in terms of that I guess I was lucky. 

My biggest fear is dating moving forward and honestly pray I don't have another ob, I had a horrible ear infection which I think knocked my immune system for a loop ### hookups no, dating yes. if someone asks Ill tell them upfront. if not then no. sorry Im not going to be that one person and yeah sure it’s unethical and I know Im not perfect but nobody is ### Yeah I mean like I said. It would be great to if I can disclose and ppl would understand and not treat me like shit. But you know, sometimes the world doesn’t work like that. Ppl can be very ignorant about things. I started off good with disclosing but now I have like 3 rejections in a row and I’m ngl, if it continues, I’m done. I blame society/cdc for not educating/even testing ppl for hsv. ### I always disclose. It’s not a big deal. Other peoples lack of awareness/ethics is not an excuse to have none yourself. ### you need to get a blood test for confirmation. lots of things can look like herpes. even if it is herpes you need to know which type it is ### Very normal where you are at mentally right now. I have not been doing very well mentally this past weekend as well, you are not alone. I had an outbreak last 4 weeks and after 1 week another more painful and ‘populated’ ob has occurred. I am trying to think rationally and not let this define me. We didn’t choose to be in this position. 
After that 1 month ob I kind of convinced my self my body ‘got over it’ but I received another. For yourself I would be somewhat prepared for another one, and if it doesn’t happen then you have more to celebrate about. Acyclovir has been really helpful for me. At the moment be the best version you can be. I’m rooting for you! And don’t stop doing things you enjoy, sometimes it feels best to put everything on hold, but try to live life and receive dopamine in other ways right now. Put it in the back ground and slowly it’ll get better :) 
I’m GHSV-2 M21 student ### I do as well. It's just I'm facing my toughest one yet very very soon and it's making me depressed/anxious like I've never felt before. ### Your words are very kind and I truly appreciate them. 😊 ### I honestly think 1.

A lot of people have HSV-1 orally and do not know it can be passed genitally (not super relevant in your case, but just lends to the huge miseducation of general public because, when do they teach us this besides when we’re 13 and aren’t mature enough to understand or care?) ### ",26,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tih3fl/how_many_people_have_actually_disclosed_to_you/

The hormone changes have not been good to me i got a uti foe the first time week 6 and 8 a yeast infection now I have my second yeast infection and I think the dryness is setting off my herpes too sadly, im really just over this. I took meds for the yeast infection and am moisturizing and taking my anti viral in hopes of some relief",2,2022-03-20 21:44:58-04:00,"Ugh you poor thing:( that sounds terrible! I work in women’s health (currently labor and delivery), and let me tell you: YEAST INFECTIONS IN PREGNANCY ARE INSANE. I’ve had so many patients struggle with UTIs and yeast infections during pregnancy. You’re more at risk for both by being pregnant! Go into the doctors ASAP and beg them for meds for your UTI and yeast infection! I’d also ask them for a daily suppressant of acyclovir. I know they’ll start you on it when you hit 36wks, but you shouldn’t have to suffer now. In the meantime you can take topical antifungals like monistat for your yeast infections! Make sure to watch out for the oral antifungal med diflucan, because that is NOT safe to take during pregnancy. Also for your UTI you can take Pyridium (azo urinary pain relief). This med is in category B for pregnancy meds ( animal studies show no harm to fetuses but there are no well-controlled studies in pregnant women). This med works so fast at relieving your bladder spasms/need to piss every 5 minutes, buuuut it won’t get rid of the actual infection. Youll have to go to the doctors ASAP for that. Don’t wait too long to go. Sometimes UTIs can spread into a kidney infection. All in all, I recommended some meds, but if you feel uncomfy at all with the thought of taking these meds, call your doctor and get a second opinion:) sending you good vibes and a healthy pregnancy:) ### Thanks! I already treated the uti a few weeks ago luckily dr gave me antibiotics. I had some monstat on hand since I get yeast infections any time I take  certain antibiotics. I have a weeks supply of anti viral I keep on hand as well I hate the idea of being on any meds regularly for herpes since I don't typically get break outs at all so hopefully this is the last outbreak or ill have to start taking suppressants. Which of course I'll have to do weeks 36 anyway for the baby safety. Good thing I keep lots of meds on hand at home ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tj0ipx/pregnancy/

ticom2,"for those struggling with their diagnosis You will be okay! 

I pop onto this sub occasionally and I see so many posts from newly-diagnosed people in sheer panic and distress. It's totally valid. I was the same way. I kept googling and googling before my doctor's appointment. I kept retracing my steps. I kept reading horror stories. I kept examining in the mirror. I kept scouring the internet for every scientific fact I could find. It was so panicked and desperate. 

When they confirmed what I already knew to be true, I crumbled.

But wow, I wish I could go back in time all those years ago and tell myself it would be okay. I wish I could tell myself to save the stress. Why the fck was herpes, of all things, making me into a big messy crybaby? Ugh. 

I take generic Valtrex daily, so I don't experience outbreaks. My life is so normal.

I disclose via text and it's not even something I bat an eye at anymore. Most people don't care.The responses are so boring at this point.  I've dated, had one night stands, had casual sex, had relationships. I've not ever transmitted it to my knowledge. I've even told some friends now. I figured why not? What if one day they encounter a date with herpes? The least I can do is help normalize it to my inner circle.

I feel like a badass every time I disclose with confidence. I feel so calm about it. People always thank me for my openness. I used to bawl like a baby while disclosing, which made it so much worse. 

Your life is not over in any way, shape, or form. Stop doom scrolling and panicking. Grieve and be upset, but only for so long. You have a treatable medical condition that SO MANY OF US have. Breathe!

You have an occasional non life threatening skin pimple /rash condition you think you HAVE to disclose but your partners could have bubonic plague and you don't care? That's really weird thinking.

When I’m on meds my lady area finally feels completely normal and I can’t wait to get that feeling back🤦🏻‍♀️ ### I didn’t say that at all lol. I don’t know where you live or what but if you think everyone will do that I think you have the wrong idea. Obviously if someone told me they have hiv or something like that I wouldn’t bother. Usually I get to the point where I actually trust someone before telling them.

I’ve had these pop up in similar areas the past few weeks. And a doctor told me it was herpes. 

Does anyone get anything like this",10,2022-03-20 20:33:04-04:00,"Doesn’t look like it to me visually. Have you gotten a blood test? ### The majority of people have no symptoms, roughly 80% ### 43F. During my first OB (18 months ago) I didnt see any sores but it was the worst pain I have ever experience in my life. It was probably tiny and close to my urethra. Maybe inside. Couldnt get tested because the doctor didnt see anything. Was given Valtrex just in case.

2nd OB again no sores. A tiny spot of skin was very  painful. No sores and no redness but it felt like that spot was on fire. Had the swab test. It was hsv2. 

So yes it can be tiny but I dont know in your case. ### Anyone else see this as familiar? To their experience. ### Can’t it go completely unnoticed in some ?

It’s also just weird that these show up and then go away within a couple days. But they’re always kind of red and irritated. 

I did and it came back negative. This was 9 weeks after unprotected sex. And 5 weeks after protected and unprotected oral. I’ve had lots of weird nerve feelings in my legs. Itching and burning at different times on the skin of the shaft. So I really don’t know what to think anymore ### With this being the case. I feel like most people should just not even care. And go on with their lives like there’s nothing ### Your symptoms do sound like herpes. Although I'd say it might not look like it from the pic - it looks different on everyone. And this could be herpes. Best to get it swabbed. Yes it can go away in few days tho. Weird nerve feelings?? I'd say nerve pains are very noticeably painful... . Placebo effect is real tho. Get tested and try not think or read much about it now as you'd just give yourself symptoms. ### Yes if I can explain. The nerve feelings in my legs at times just feel like dull ache or restless leg. And then occasionally a little zap feeling below my butt on the back of my thigh. I could definitely be just noticing something that always was there. 

And honestly I’m contemplating if I will even get tested again. Not knowing definitely isn’t fun and it’s eating me up. Especially not knowing if it may be hsv1 or 2. 

But part of me thinks I should follow what the cdc says and just not test unless I know for sure. And have serious symptoms. 

I generally hyper focus too much and I’m going to try to stop giving a shit about anything anymore. Why should I care. I barely have sex anyways. So I’ll just move on and not hyper focus anymore. ### At least your nerve pains are bearable. Some people need meds for them and I don't mean antivirals. I'd rather know in case it isn't herpes and I have something else .-. But it is obs your decision. I'd personally feel terrible if I accidentally give it to someone else when I knew this could be herpes but just never tested so never disclosed 🤷‍♀️ ### If I have it. At 5 weeks I was negative.

i just feel very hurt because he’s just now telling me, i understand he was probably nervous or insecure but it definitely changes things for me and i can’t help how i feel.

with all that being said, i’ve been very sick with flu symptoms this whole month, it’s been accompanied with headache and cough and runny nose which is why i’m confused as if i’ve been infected or not and it’s just now presenting. my lower body has been killing but no outbreak or anything. it doesn’t burn to pee, no tingling sensation or anything like that. just body aches.

if it even matters , he didn’t appear to have any open cuts or wounds when i did perform oral on him. i’m not sure if he’s taking any antiviral medication at all either but i’m assuming he’s not.

I know I shouldn’t be trying to diagnose myself on the internet but by the time I spotted them it was too late for swabs.

Back story: I had a potential exposure a few weeks ago. A week later I started experiencing a sore throat, thick yellowish discharge, painful urination and I noticed something that looked like a popped blister near my clitoral hood and some redness in my anus. Since then I’ve been feeling itchy, feverish, fatigued and having muscle aches. I had multiple areas swabbed and an IgG, IgM, and full std panel all come back negative.

I got tested for my former gf, (she can’t get pass it)
I tested positive for Hsv-2 and I went all in.
2 blood test at different labs, and finally the gold standard “western blot test from Washington university. I got this shit. All of these are blood test.
I’ve never had a swab test or blisters or anything on my junk or mouth… ever.
But 20tears ago I would care for my mom, who used to get these little blisters on her hands.
She always said it was a fungus so we treated it with fungus spray.
After she passed I started getting the same on my hands, I believed that it was a fungus and treated it with the same anti-fungus as I did with her.
This went on for years. Eventually I never got another OB on my fingers.
After my I tested positive I did research and read that Herpatic whitlow is HSV2 or HSV1 that has entered the body via a lesion, or cut into the hands , I can only point to that place, for my source for my infection.
After speaking to Terri Warren, she said that she would not believe that that’s my source of infection, because nobody has ever had daily testing from that source done.
But my point is a different one. From all the research I’ve done, once you have the virus in your system it only sheds or outbreak at the source of infection. So if you have it on your hands it should not travel to your Genitalia or your lips, because your body has created anti-bodys to protect those other parts of the body.
I would love to hear that I’m wrong 
I hate misinformation but nobody has been able to give me any proof otherwise. ### Thank you for the reply!

You don't actually know that he doesn't have it (unless you've already asked him and seen test results), you aren't wasting someone's time by getting to know them, and you don't actually ""have to"" overthink this situation.

The safer sex conversation should be a part of every encounter you have. You're fine with having it with casual sex partners, so approach this the same way. Maybe he doesn't have herpes. Maybe he has HPV. Or maybe he has something else that will impact you in a relationship, like bad credit or a criminal record or a bad relationship with his family.

Everyone has things they don't want to tell a new dating partner. One of yours is herpes. Give the guy, and more importantly, yourself, a chance ### I totally feel you. I know how stressful it is..

But….

I’m almost 21 now and I still have never experienced a single OB or other related symptoms to HSV-2. Around 6 months ago I made an appointment to test whether or not I do have it because I am aware that there are a LOT of inaccuracies with blood tests. 

I did the EIA test and received another “grey zone” result (1.05). I still am with the same person I was back then, therefore my body count is still at 2. I’ve only kissed other people prior to that because I was still very young. I just find it extremely hard to believe that I do have herpes type 2. If I tested positive for herpes type 1 I’d understand, I went to summer camp, everyone shared water bottles etc. it’s more realistic! 

My boyfriend went to the clinic and the doctor refused to test him because visibly he was fine and unless there’s symptoms the doctor didn’t want to test him. The doctor explained how inaccurate the blood tests are in our country which is why he didn’t want to give the test, he said the emotional repercussions are far worse than the physical.

It’s been 4 years, I should’ve felt something, anything, by now. My boyfriend should’ve had something happen to him too, but there’s zero symptoms. 5 years together and nothing has ever came up. Where I live the Western Blot test is unavailable so I will never know 100% if I do have it or not. If things don’t work out with my current partner do I need to disclose that I might have herpes? Any advice what to do going forward?

tiqnej,"Stuck in a herpes limbo… Hi guys, looking for some advice, apologies for long post but it is quite a difficult circumstance to explain.

I first thought I was having a herpes outbreak a year ago. I had burning pain round anus (sorry for TMI), shooting pains down thighs,  buttocks  and testicles, no blisters but what looked like some small red spots round anus. Went to get a test but due to the shitty state of sexual health clinics during lockdown (all walk-ins cancelled) and how hard it is to get an appointment, did not get swabbed until after symptoms had started dying down. Dr said swab would be way less accurate because of this. This came back negative.

 Doctor said it was not a clear cut herpes case and if swab was negative to carry on with life as normal, which I did. Everything seemed fine until around 4 months later, I had a flare up of these symptoms again. Again, I went to clinic and went as soon as possible, again came back negative, but again accuracy of this was reduced due to the time it took to get swabbed ( think I had to wait around 6 days to get in to a clinic).

I stopped having sex with anyone and told myself I would wait till I know for sure my status before carrying on. I bought self test kit for if an outbreak ever came. Since then, I’ve never felt like I have had an outbreak, but I have very regular nerve pain, down my anus, buttocks, thighs - It can be really painful! So strange, as this didn’t happen at all in the four months between suspected outbreak 1 and 2.

Fast forward to now, I’ve recently used my swab kit once when I felt some pain down there and that also came back negative. I have accepted that I probably have it and can handle getting on meds and disclosing to partners etc, but can’t do this until I know for sure that I have it! I’m at the point where I would actually like an outbreak so I can get tested and know for sure - till then not really comfortable sleeping with anyone.

Has anyone ever had anything like this? Is there anything I can do?

I know I could be shedding, but I take my antivirals every once in awhile.",7,2022-03-19 19:55:19-04:00,"Don’t be scared. Just look at the stats of how many people have it too. Get things steamy and then before you do anything that can cause an outbreak just say “I want to be transparent w you before things go further..” and simply disclose what happened and say how many other people have it as well (like 50% or more?). And also if you’ve only had one outbreak you may not experience symptoms again, which is something to share as well. But it’s all in your attitude, be nonchalant and confident about it. You got this. I’ve fortunately had all good disclosures so far where they were comfortable moving forward bc the commonality of herpes or having it already themselves. If they want to have sex w you often times herpes won’t stop them. Just have condoms on deck if they (or you) want to use protection. ### Make sure you ask your potential partner to get a FULL PANEL std test. Then when they have their results in hand say "" oh I have hsv1 . Statistically speaking chances are 80% or so that they have hsv1 as well. Problem solved. ### Listen, we can be rejected for anything, right? Maybe political views or religious beliefs are too different, hobbies are too different, one might be a steak lover and the other vegan, one might love animals and the other's allergic. It can happen for any reason - that's what dating is for - to find people we mesh with. 

So maybe take some time to get to know people before disclosing, and if someone violates your trust, then deny. They'll look like the ass, not you. Or you could own it. Your call. 

Taking your antivirals every once in a while - I'm not sure what that means. If you want to reduce shedding, it has to be every day. 

Remember that every single person you meet has something they would rather not have to tell the person they are newly dating. Everyone. Yours is just a virus that 67% under 50 have. :) ### I agree, with another comment here - maybe encourage your partner to get a full panel and exchange your results. Failing that, get to know them a bit better and then disclose.

I dont agree with what the other comment on here suggests about waiting to get hot and steamy and then disclosing - that to me sounds like a bad time to disclose. Especially if they end up with having questions they want answered. For some people it could ruin the mood. But that's just me, your mileage may vary. ### Hey! I legit just got diagnosed and am still dealing with my first outbreak, so I haven't disclosed to someone I want to have sex with right now yet, but I've told a lot of people, including people I slept with and people wanting to sleep with me.

Everyone has been really nice and talking about it has made me feel a lot better and a lot less like it's something bad or shameful. I think they key is to be matter of fact. Don't be outwardly nervous or acting like you're telling them something awful that you hope they can accept you for, cause that's not what's happening.

HSV1 is incredibly common. Your potential partner is more likely to have it than not and will certainly have been with others that had it whether they knew it or not. The only difference is that you're being open and communicating about it which is a good thing vs an embarrassing one. It's a sign of a partner who you can probably have great sex with since they are open and responsible.

GHSV1 is very unlikely to be transmittable even on days where you are shedding, which is apparently as low as 4 days a year. 

Just be mindful of if you are having an outbreak. If you want to be extra careful, my doctor said taking antivirals at least from 10 days before sex is best.

You might want to encourage them to get tested for HSV1 and HSV2 themselves. This is a two way street. ### Forgot to mention that people I've talked to re sexual partners I all met only once. A couple I hadn't slept with yet but had planned to. I didn't know them long, so I don't think connection needs to be super deep. I do imagine though that if it's one of the first things someone learns about you, they will potentially judge you and dip. I figure my plan will be to meet someone in person at least once and then tell them, even potentially during the first meeting just later on. 

I think in the situation you're in, that most reasonable people would be fine with it. ### ",5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/ti8bec/scared_to_disclose/

(From here on I’m calling it HSV because that’s what I prefer)

HSV is not this all the time outbreak you have to face. At the most it will pop up from on occasion and at the least it will only pop up a couple times in your life. It’s easy to live like it’s not even there. When you do have outbreaks... sure it’s uncomfortable and can make you sad. BUT you get through it. Life doesn’t stop because of some bumps. 

I’m 23, pregnant and happily with my boyfriend. We found out we had HSV-2 at the same time and decided it didn’t matter much. It’s taken me a couple years to really accept it but even back then I stayed optimistic and learned as much as I could about the virus and my body. It felt scary at first. But you will find that most people won’t ever know or need to know. And anyone you choose to tell will show you if they’re someone you want in life based on their reaction to you. You don’t want a man, friend or whatever that doesn’t accept and understand something trivial. And when you break it down HSV 1 or 2 are both silly little pains. We are part of nature and not immune to things like this. That’s okay. It’s just life. You 100% will go on to find so much love and enjoyment in life.



Here’s some facts that help me feel unbothered and secure in myself as a woman with HSV-2! 

- HSV-2 does not transmit to the mouth as easily as HSV-1 transmits to the genitals. 
- Unless you are having a time of viral shedding (causing high viral load) your chances of infecting someone else are very low.
- there are couples with one positive person and one negative and they don’t transmit.
- there are meds that help protect your partner from getting it. You take the anti-viral and it helps keep your viral load way down.
- condoms are a thing 
- HSV does not hurt your reproductive system.
- there are many options for how to manage it. 
- TONS of people have type 1, 2 or both. 
- other STIs should be taken more seriously than HSV. HSV gets a bad rep. HSV is not life threatening. But you know what can be? Chlamydia and gonorrhea! Yup those can kill you if left untreated. HSV cannot. It’s just a little irritating thing that happens sometimes.


Hope some of this helps! 

Remember you are more than your sex. But also your sex and love life is not over. It’s just different... which no matter what life will throw things at us to challenge our relationships with others and ourselves. Be confident! Knowledge is power

ti86gw,"I think I messed up really bad So I 22m went on a date with a 20f last night. We’ve been on 3 dates now and I really like her. I was unlucky enough to get hsv-1 when I was a child. I haven’t had an outbreak in over a year but I woke up this morning feeling abit dehydrated (and hungover). And there it was, that slight tingle in the corner of my mouth. So we did kiss last night and this leads me to believe that I likely passed it on to her. I don’t know what to do, she told me I was her first kiss, like why did this have to happen. I just can’t shake the feeling that she doesn’t deserve this. I haven’t spoken with her since the date I don’t know how to go about this I really don’t want to lose her but I’m well aware that saying nothing isn’t an option. Like is it for sure that she now has it? How do I go about this? Fuck.",5,2022-03-19 19:48:13-04:00,"Been in the same situation and it made me feel better once I said something to the person. Your guilt is going to eat you up if you stay quiet… just explain your situation and tell her that the next day you felt symptoms. Or just wait and see how it goes for a couple of days if she’s fine after a week and things keep going to the right direction still let her know your status ### And no it’s not a for sure thing she got it.. my bf gets them all the time and I’m fine ### I can't lie and say I don't regret getting with the person that gave it to me but a lot of that is because I didn't even like them/feel attracted to them. I just felt like I needed to stop being prudish. After them I was with people I was more attracted to that I had better sex with using protection.

If I had liked the person and the experience, and was explained the situation as you did, I would understand and I wouldn't be that upset.

With ohsv1 being so common and you having had it so young, I understand why you didn't think about it. I always assumed I had it and never thought twice about it, the same goes for a lot of people. Turns out I didn't have it as a kid like I thought and contracted it now so I had nothing to disclose till recently, but I thought I did, I just never thought it mattered. It didn't even occur to me

Having my first outbreak and being diagnosed recently as an adult was a wake-up call for me that actually this is something I should be talking to people about.

Don't beat yourself up too much. Talk to her honestly and try to be more open in the future. ### Unlikely tbh. You should tell her though. 

You can ease her in with calling it a cold sore since I assume y’all won’t get sexual that quickly. There’s a good chance she gets cold sores too. 

If she doesn’t, warn her. If she gets infected, it’ll take a few months before she has enough antibodies to protect other regions from being infected. ### Thank you for the comments I really appreciate taking the time the answer my questions ### ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/ti86gw/i_think_i_messed_up_really_bad/

We’re farther along in science than a lot of ppl think.  CRSPR has cured aids, blindness, and sickle cell just to name a few.  And it’s also responsible for the vaccine the world took for covid ### Absolutely this will be resolved—there are too many remarkable scientists working toward a common goal and many are well funded.  The approaches are new and novel and they have an understanding as never before.  I’ve waited 30+ years and will gladly wait a little longer, and a cause most worthy of contributing to.

Please consider one of my favorite movie quotes of all time from “Shawshank Redemption”, it’s the only attitude to have: ""Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of the things, and no good thing ever dies."" ### Yea its gonna be curable. Like black plague and all the other diseases people once thought was incurable. it's gonna take time tho. ### There’s a few vaccines in the works but I dunno. Feel like big corporations will wanna shut it down..I imagine  a condition like herpes that’s there for life they want to keep making money off valtrex and not cure it. If it happens it obviously that would be great but ya.

Allah knows best! ### [removed] ### How would a vaccine cure someone who already has it? ### Isn't mRNA what we took for covid? That's not CRISPR. ### Big pharma makes little to no money on valtrex anymore. It’s a confusing virus but if there was a cure they’d release it. So many people would benefit and they’d make so much money it makes no sense to not drop a cure or vaccine if they truly had one. ### I used to sue big pharma so I would typically agree with you, but for this, they would make bank because every sexually active teenager would get it it would become the norm. Like HPV vaccine for women. Except everyone would get the herpes vaccine! Tons of money for them ### Wish big pharma would meet us in the middle. Give us an updated pill so we won’t pass it on to others like what they’re doing with HIV meds ### I’m pretty sure some people would pay over the odds for it. Small price to pay to not have the pain in the ass little shit virus. But they would probably earn more from valtrex over a lifetime if taken for suppression. I have a suspicion it would actually save lives. It must be a factor in a fair few suicides. Even though it shouldn’t be. ### Wtf is a way to detox a virus?

And the Fred Hutch Disease research center has been working on a gene editing cure. Shanghai BDgene out of China is using a modified Crisper editor. ### My guess is that not everyone will be able to afford the vax, so having valtrex and other drugs will still be a viable option for many ### Good point ### Yeah I mean I’m hopeful but like hard to imagine it actually coming to fruition.

Desperate people will pay anything ### [removed] ### I know it’s shitty but at least it’s not HIV eh? It’s all how you look at it. Yeah it’s shit. But it’s not life threatening and it can be controlled with meds and the chance of spreading reduced a lot. Cold sores on the pp or fu fu. Don’t let it grind you down. I bet you that a fuck ton of people have it. Famous people too and they just get on with it. Docs don’t even test for it usually, because it’s not life threatening and doesn’t make you infertile. It’s an inconvenience. I know it can get you down. I believe they will cure it too. There’s all kinds of shit they didn’t have to cure but did. It’s more common than you’d think. Are you on meds now? ### Ok you can suck a dick ### No one made me believe they are a living organism. I remember clearly being taught that they are half living/half non-living. They only reproduce inside living organisms. Outside of living organisms, they can’t reproduce or do anything. If you can’t trust science, how can you trust anything? ### [removed] ### Nah I don’t need them. Break out like once a year. ### [removed] ### Even though I break out once a year too, I take the daily suppression meds to help with any shedding to avoid passing it to a sexual partner.

thxptv,"I Keep Hearing The Stigma is The Worst Part But Is It? I just contracted GHSV1 and am experiencing my first outbreak.

I haven't been hiding it so far. I told planned hookups I can't meet atm due to contracting it. Told past partners to check for it and told the person I think gave it to me to get tested. I have told my parents. I've told my BFF and a few others I'm close to. I've also told medical staff that didn't know during appointments in order to assure everything was done safely.

I think I'm able to talk about it matter of factly so people don't react badly. I'm not ashamed.

I'm not ashamed but I am really scared. Cause this shit hurts. 

It started out not so bad but now it's more blistery. Things feel so sore I can't do anything but lie down with my legs spread and then the itchiness becomes obvious. I can't say I've managed to avoid scratching cause I definitely have scratched.

The doctor said I probably won't have another outbreak but reddit is showing me a different reality. For people with GHSV1, how often are outbreaks for you? How do you deal? There's no way I could go to work like this if I had a job.

I am so scared that this will become a regular issue in my life and I won't be able to deal.",40,2022-03-19 11:34:57-04:00,"F20 ghsv1. my first outbreak was also brutal but i never had another one since (little more than 2 years since first outbreak). for most people ik with ghsv1 it’s the same, first outbreak and none since. so glad to hear you’re so open about it and not ashamed (: it’ll get better!! ### Talking from a medical background, 
You shouldn’t be ashamed. HSV is common. It is not necessarily to tell friends unless someone you know will support you if you need. For partner/s, you can use anonymous messages services available for free by some websites when you can’t tell them directly. 
Usually, the first outbreak is a bit hard, but it will pass within a week. In case had more outbreaks during his/her life, it comes mild, and it has other triggers such as trauma, stress, or any issue that might reduce body immunity, so keep a healthy lifestyle, exercise, and protected sex. 
For now, I hope your doc prescribed antiviral medications, it might help to faster recovery even when you have already developed the symptoms. Also, get a spray reliever for itching and burning sensation

I hope you get well soon ### I'm worried about how to keep my vagina hair free or what consequences of sex will be as far as outbreaks. I'm worried how I'm gonna keep a job if I have to take time off for outbreaks all the time. I just don't know how I'll deal. ### Comment removed due to misinformation. It is very well established that ghsv1 is far less contagious than both genital hsv2 and oral hsv1.

Studies haven't been conducted on actual transmission rates. But this can already be inferred by comparing asymptomatic shedding rates, which are known for all four type & location combinations, as well as the experiences of herpes experts and other STD experts who have worked in the field treating patients for multiple decades and say things such as:

...I would make is that genital to genital HSV1 transmission not only is ""somewhat"" uncommon. It appears to be very rare. In my 40+ years in the STD business, I have never seen a patient with newly acquired genital HSV1 who apparently acquired it by genital intercourse, only by receiving oral sex...

(Source: STD Expert H. Hunter Handsfield addressing Question #1238: ""HSV1 Genital-Transmission and Disclosure"" on the AskExpertsNow forum of the American Sexual Health Association)

And here's a quote from STD expert Edward W Hook on the same forum:

Genital HSV-1 is transmitted from infected partners far less often than genital HSV-2.  This is no doubt the result of several contributors including that clinical recurrences are less common with genital HSV-1 than for genital HSV-2 and because when people have genital HSV-1 they experience only about 20-25% of the amount of asymptomatic shedding of the virus that persons with genital HSV-2 do.  There are no recommendations on the potential benefit of chronic suppressive therapy for genital HSV-1, in part because the transmission is so uncommon that it is simply not a practical thing to study.  Does that mean that sexual transmission of GHSV-1 does not occur- of course not but it is quite uncommon.

Also note that more recent research has determined that genital hsv1 shedding frequency is actually even less than that stated above.

And here's a quote from herpes expert Terri Warren regarding genital-to-genital hsv1 transmission:

the likelihood that you would infect someone through intercourse is incredibly low.

(Source)

And another quote from Terri:

We actually have some great new information about genital HSV 1 infection based on a paper presented by Dr. Christine Johnson at the University of Washington, this past July.  Once a person has had genital HSV 1 for two years, based on her study, they only shed virus on 4 days out of an entire year.  That's why transmission through intercourse is so rare.  Now some people may shed virus more often and certainly some shed less, and there is more shedding quite early in the infection.  But that's the average after two years and as you can see it is very low indeed.  Based on her paper, I would say shedding at one year is probably around 4-5% of days, so 4-5 days out of 100 days, as an estimate.

(Source: Question #6376: ""To Dr. Handsfield"" on the AskExpertsNow forum of the American Sexual Health Association).

And in regard to the ghsv1 shedding frequency stated above, keep in mind that the vast majority of exposures to asymptomatic shedding do not result in transmission. Asymptomatic shedding makes transmission possible but it certainly doesn't guarantee it. Far more often than not, exposure to asymptomatic shedding doesn't result in transmission. So by 2 years in, there are only 4 days on average, per year, when there would be any risk at all, and even on those days the risk would still be low.

This is what the MOD posted on another thread. ### Ghsv1 here, I’ve had it for three years now and I’ve had the same fears 😊 typically I get one once a year or if I’m stressed one every 6 months. If it did interfere  with work I simply tell them I am sick ### Would you feel the same way if you had hsv2? ### F25 GSV1: My first outbreak was hellish, and I haven’t had any since. 3 years. ### Don’t fret, GHSV-1 is the least transmissible strain, with no outbreak the chances of passing onto someone are incredibly low some say extremely low. Genital to genital and genital to oral are unheard of by all the leading experts. Look up the MOD info on GHSV-1 and it’ll give a huge sense of relief. ### Like id honestly have everyone know I have this, even strangers, than deal with outbreaks. ### I was sick for over 6 weeks with my first outbreak and in ED too. Then when I had sex w the guy again the pain went away. Now we broke up and pain is back and I’m on the pills again. CrazyZ ### GHSV1 here for a year. I’ve had 3 proper outbreaks. Think I may have had some minor ones too. Not sure why I’ve had quite a few but I do live a bit of an unhealthy lifestyle (drinking lots) as I’m at uni. ### No I can’t figure it out. My highest stress was in September and no break outs, Covid in December and no break out and now almost exactly a year later I have a break out. Very weird. I’m stressed but was more in September so idk ### Medication and time are both shown to reduce severity of outbreaks, hopefully that’s true for you. It wasn’t true for me but mine were never bad, also I have HSV2 ### 35-year-old woman here, gHSV1+ for a year and a half (at least, that's how long I've known about it.) I've had exactly one outbreak, and while it was extremely painful at the time, it was a year and a half ago, and I haven't had a second outbreak yet. Dr. Hunter Handsfield has been quoted as saying that for folks with gHSV1, if you do not have a second outbreak within your first year of infection, then there is an 88% chance that you will never again have another outbreak. On the other hand, I have seen folks in this sub say that they have had multiple and frequent outbreaks with gHSV1. There is going to be variation from person to person, since all of our bodies react to viruses differently. But on average, according to our current understanding and knowledge, recurring gHSV1 will cause an outbreak about 0.7 times per year. ### F30 GHSV1- I’ve had it for about 3 years now. My first outbreak was absolutely unbearable but I haven’t had a real full on outbreak since. If I ever think or feel suspicious of some odd feeling I just take my valtrex right away and the feeling passes within a day. ### That's really good to hear. Yeah I feel like there is no reason to be ashamed. Most people have it. I don't want to put myself into a headspace where I feel I need to hide this ""dirty"" secret or that this is a reason for people not to sleep with me, when it's more common than not. Talking about it has made me feel infinitely better. ### That's the thing. I actually don't feel shame at all. I've messaged anyone that needed to know very openly. And I've told other people as I said. Not a single person has reacted badly. 

But omg it hurts 😩. I hope as you said this is as bad as it gets and that it gets significantly easier if not just not flaring up again. ### Wow this is such useful information. I'm so happy reading this. It's so uncomfortable dealing with the pain but I've been trying to remind myself of all the positives in the situation and knowing how unlikely I am to give it to someone is very much a positive. ### Thanks for this. How long have your outbreaks lasted since the initial one? Have you noticed them be less severe or getting less severe each time or shorter each time. ### I'm not gonna speak to an experience I haven't had, but I do know the stigma is greater, so I recognize how that could make it a lot more difficult for people to deal with. 

I can see how my post could be dismissive of people that really struggle with the stigma. It's not something to downplay, you're right. It's a really hard thing to deal with and even though I have found the pain more difficult, the stigma has affected me to some extent.

 Ive been trying to be really positive and not let this define me or let others define me by this. Even with hsv1 I've found it difficult as while I know it's really common, not a single person I've spoken to has shared they have it too. I can read the stats but if I don't see it in real life around me it feeds the voice in my head that's telling that I'm all the negative ideas that come with having an STD.

I can be confident talking to people but I'm still kinda desperately thinking ""yeah you can be nice to me but would now think of me as someone you wouldn't want to sleep with?"" I just am doing my best to shut that voice down.

I've tried to see the silver linings, and most of those apply to hsv2. For example, now any partners I have sexually will have been people that have been able to have good enough open communication with me that we've been able to navigate this conversation comfortably and with care. I think that will only be a good thing. I don't need everyone to want me, just the right people, and this is a good test of that in a way. I'm also a lot more knowledgeable about STDs now. I used to be ignorant and would have made judgements that I now see are wrong and I feel better as a person for having had the opportunity to change and grow in this capacity.

So yeah the experiences are different. The stigma is different. I can't speak to what it's like to deal with. But I can say most of what I have been using to cope with this change are things that would apply to people with either virus. ### Omg praying this is me. ### Thank you! I'm honestly not worried about this. Im not ashamed and Im confident that I can be responsible about this. Ill take antivirals as needed and will always disclose and decide with a partner depending on their status whats safe.

My fear is just about dealing with the pain of outbreaks ### Wow that's really intense. Do you feel like there were things that made the outbreaks worse? ### That's good to know. Do you feel like anything brought on the outbreaks? Stress or something else? ### So you just had one break out a year after the initial? It's obviously far from great but feels like something I can handle. I just can't deal with this even more than once a year tbh. ### I really hope it ends up true for me! And I hope eventually your outbreaks are less severe and less often too cause they really suck. But I'm glad yours at least were never bad ### Oh yes much less severe 😊 I would suggest getting a big bottle of an antiviral for herpes (Valtrex) I
Keep a big bottle on me and whenever I have a stressful day/week I
Will take a pill. I’m actually having outbreak symptoms now so you’re not alone. ### If I allow my symptoms to get to
The point of lesions and I take 3 valtrex a day… 2-3 days ### Also I think I would seek validation from having lots of people match with me and message me on apps. I know the messages will be fewer now, but again, its a quality over quantity thing. And most importantly, I don't want to be seeking validation through these apps. I want to use them to find people to have sex or dates or whatever with, but not find confidence. I need to improve my confidence in healthier ways that come from somewhere true to me. That way it will be more real and more permanent anyways. ### Oh okay I was just asking. I have a lot of the same worries as you but like you’re saying, the stigma against hsv2 is worse so it is harder to deal with. But I guess I just have to fight thru it. ### I was very recently diagnosed and my first outbreak was the worst experience I’ve ever had. I figured out how to best manage the pain for myself though. I was taking antivirals as prescribed by my doc and then some pain meds as well. Initially anything touching the area hurt. I would shower and try to clean the area (just with water) as best I could, I actually turned the shower to cold to rinse the area because it kind of numbed the stinging a bit. Then gently pat it dry (with a seperate towel). I put a numbing gel on the sores (lidocaine/lignocaine) 2-3 times a day and that would help. I was also sitting on ice packs a few hours a day if it got really bad. The pain was from stinging but then also like an aching in my butt and legs. The painkillers did help with that when I would take them regularly.

All in all, this is my first outbreak so I can’t speak to anything going forward but it was absolute hell for a couple of days and then it eased a bit when I figured out my own routine of handling it. I know it might be hard to ‘see the light at the end of the tunnel’ but it will pass and you will be ok. ### I think friction is a stress for mine which is pretty annoying bc sex = friction. My last one seemed to be caused by my sanitary pads causing irritation then it turning into an outbreak. But I did also just have a uni deadline so maybe it was stress too. Who knows ### I have to say I also bought something from target from the honey pot made of lavender and mint and it is very soothing to genital area. I’m still itchy and uncomfortable but when I apply that it numbs and soothes it I recommend it ### Thanks so much for this! Sorry for all the questions but would be able to describe your first outbreak and then what later outbreaks were like? ### Damn that's what I'm worried about. Things like sex or shaving meaning an outbreak every time. I won't be able to deal 😭 ### Yeah people have mentioned certain ointments for soothing in this group on other posts but I'm so scared to put anything on them. But I think I'll have to come around to the idea cause Im too weak to deal with this without some help lol ### My first outbreak put me in the hospital for a few days and took two weeks to heal…. It was extremely severe. Future outbreak came with leg, butt, and vagina pain which automatically indicates an outbreak is going to happen… but future outbreaks could be paired with a cold as well ### It’s not weakness it’s unbearable in a very sensitive part of body! ### Oh my god that sounds awful. I'm glad it's getting better but even later outbreaks sound like they've been really tough. ### If you have any questions you can always reach out :) ### ",9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/thxptv/i_keep_hearing_the_stigma_is_the_worst_part_but/

thvsks,"Person I’m seeing bashed on herpes... I have herpes So I (25F) am seeing this other woman (28F). By the way, I told her I had hsv-1 only a few days after started talking just to get it out of the way. I’m asymptomatic and have never had an outbreak, I just tested positive by blood test. 

We were having a conversation about safe sex and what not, and she said she was once going to hook up with someone and the other girl disclosed she has herpes. The person I’m dating said ”haaaail naw”, something  along these lines but def negative .. basically being freaked out and stuff. She must have not known hsv-1 (cold sores) is herpes. 

Immediately I was like “umm you know I have herpes right??” It got kinda awkward but I immediately told her that it’s very common and my ex got it from kissing her mom as a child. She seemed to be really supportive after that, and obviously was ok with me having it. 

However..is it possible to recover from that? I’m sure she felt just as awkward as me. Is how she reacted a red flag or is it something we could get past because she was willing to listen ? 

Tl;dr is it a red flag if the person I’m dating bashed on herpes?",16,2022-03-19 10:00:25-04:00,"Herpes sucks. Knee-jerk reaction is knowing herpes sucks and avoiding it. You said the same things before you had herpes, too. 

But... Good things happened... you did adult things and talked :-) and seems fine, probably is fine.

Can you recover from her knee-jerk reaction? ### You can't hold people accountable for their ignorance.

If once she started getting educated, she immediately changed her attitude, that's like the *opposite* of a red flag. That's the mark of good character. ### This is the thing I don’t get when it comes to the knee jerk reaction. Sure no one wants herpes but given the current hookup/dating culture, it’s seems hypocritical to fear it when most ppl don’t live their lives in a way to avoid it. I rarely see advice that states to find “the one” for you when you’re young, get full panel testing before any touching/kissing and stay together forever with that partner being the only person you have sex with. Instead all you hear is go out there, explore, date.. well then society as a whole has to accept herpes is a common risk factor of modern dating. ### . The makers of Valtrex launched a scare campaign in the late 70s to make herpes terrifying so people would buy their medicine.  It worked and has had decades long after effects. People honestly just don't know. They hear ""herpes"" and assume every case means someone's genitals look permanently like a google image they saw of the worst case of hsv in an advanced auto immune sufferer. They don't know mouth cold sores are herpes or that most cases are mild or asymptomatic. Also has she been tested? She probably has hsv1. Most people do ### I dont wana say it's a redflag because she seemed to be understanding afterwards but if you truly don't feel comfortable with her anymore then u should let her know it won't work ### Completely agree. I would try not to think about it too deeply. It's not a desirable thing to have, I'd react the same way before I had it. ### Thank you I completely agree!! I would never act super disgusted when talking about ANY std in general to someone I’m getting to know cause that just seems super.. immature in my opinion ### I mean that first outbreak is no joke. 1-4 weeks of hell. ### Stop noooo I’m on my first OB don’t tell me this is going to be 4 weeks. I feel like i have a hemrhoid but on fire in my ass my godddd. And no, i did not do anal i don’t get it. ### Take valtrexxx now! It’s more like two weeks but my symptoms lingered.

ti201y,High Arginine in pre workout & protein powder So prior to my diagnosis I was pretty active/fit and would drink pre workout/ protein powder as part of my routine. When I got diagnosed with genital hsv I stopped working out entirely due to depression and what not. Now a few yrs later Ive started working out again like before BUT I’ve noticed that any time I drink pre workout or protein powder now I get nasty outbreaks. It usually causes me to stop working out for at least a week because of the pain. I checked the ingredients and most pre workout/protein powder has SUPER high amounts of arginine in it which I gathered I’m very sensitive to. Now I’m not taking any workout supplements which I get is no big deal but I like the routine and energy/muscle I get from the pre workout/protein powder. I’m wondering if anyone else has experienced this and if you found supplements that didn’t cause outbreaks that are low in arginine??? Or am I not gonna be able to take supplements anymore ??? 😭😭😭 pls help!!!!,8,2022-03-19 14:51:58-04:00,"I’ve heard this before about protein powders.  The key here is ratios. 

Pretty much everything you eat has arginine in it. There just needs to be more lysine than arginine in what you take in. 

Most protein powders I’ve seen will have like 1200 arginine 1100 lysine, for example. (These are not literal numbers I’m using, the point is both are present, there’s just a little more arginine). 

This is where you will run into the problems. 

So what you can do is supplement lysine so that your total intake is greater than your total intake of arginine that day. 

If your pre-workout is just one big scoop of arginine, you may have some problems counterbalancing that. ### Dude same!!! Well I’m still in the depression state and haven’t been back in the gym since my diagnosis but i think my pre workout triggered my first OB and made it alot worse and I used to work out at 4am so now it’s like how am I supposed to do that with out any pre workout ?? I’ve also learned from some people it’s not just the arginine it’s the caffeine so even if some say low arginine the high amounts of caffeine can trigger OBS ### I did not think of that and ive been having creatine every day... it's my first OB and it just wont be over  ive taking acyvlovir for a month now
I also have lysine
Honestly changing my diet has been the hardest part i cant live without caffeine 
I just miss who i was so bad ### Hey there! So before my diagnosis I used to drink a vegan protein shake every day! With either mixed berries & cherries, oats, chocolate or peanut butter. Now I still drink them, but every other day (or less) & I've modified it. So instead of 2 scoops I use 1, no oats or a small handful. I opt more for vanilla than chocolate & I skip the peanut butter. (Now chocolate & peanut butter have become an occasional treat, along with mixed berries & cherries) I also add 1000mg of l-lysine and opt more for frozen fruits that are low in arginine such as papaya, banana, & mango. With these modifications I've been able to enjoy protein shakes again with no symptoms or outbreaks. I don't take preworkout anymore and instead have green tea or a shot of espresso (coffee contains arginine, but I've noticed if I take a small amount my body tolerates it). ### I never understood this at all. I’m a bodybuilder and arginine has no effect on my outbreaks at all. I take preworkout 6/7 days of the week and my daily meals are high in arginine as well and I have no outbreaks. ### This was v helpful! Makes a lot of sense, thank you 🙏 ### Everyone’s body reacts to and handles the virus and it’s triggers differently. Arginine helps the virus replicate. ### Careful on the supplementing Lysine.  If you need like 2,000-3,000mg a day to keep it higher than arginine, this can adversely affect your kidneys long term.  

There are some protein powders that have a better arginine / lysine ratio.  I think all of them list the BCAA content on the label so you can hunt for one that way. ### ",5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/ti201y/high_arginine_in_pre_workout_protein_powder/

So the odds of him having the virus is also high. 

We used a condom during sex, however he performed oral on me. If he does have the virus, how possible is it for me to be infected? I'm just super paranoid, and I really don't want to have genital herpes.

I love those studies because they give me hope for my future but part of me also thinks they’re horseshit 😆 because of how easily i got it. ### 200-300 is an unreasonable number.

ti9eg7,"I have no access to a doctor or any way to test myself. Are these images consistent with a herpes outbreak? (male) So… I have a partner that has pretty severe acne who recently performed oral sex on me. It later became evident to me that it’s possible some of her acne was in fact a cold sore.

Since then I’ve been a little hyper-aware of my situation downstairs, and I’ve noticed a few tiny red bumps. I’ve noticed this sort of thing before this - typically just a single small red bump that disappears. Likely a pimple or ingrown hair. And unfortunately I use electric trimmers that are pretty old and don’t have the blade guard on them anymore, so sometimes they rough up the skin a bit. All of this makes it difficult to tell.

I have no pain or discomfort. We’re about 5 days from exposure at this point. Nothing on my lips, either. I have noticed ever such slight itchiness in the general area, but I’m pretty sure this is just my hyper-awareness of it playing tricks on me, lol.

Here is the album. Obviously it is pretty NSFW so please view with caution. Can anyone tell me if these seem consistent with an outbreak? The bumps don’t look quite as severe in person as they do here. I’ve got to really stretch my stuff out to really make them this evident.

Could be a million things ### I have something similar and wondering the same, waiting on western blot results. Although with mine I have a little discomfort and pain. ### That would appear to be HPV. See a dermatologist to have it removed. Treat it with tea tree oil in the meantime. ### When I saw her she said she thought she had a cold sore. I asked her if she meant one from HSV and she said she didn’t realize it was the same thing. But later she said it was just a pimple that was right against the corner of her lip. And again, she does have acne around her mouth area, so it was difficult to tell. It kinda looked like a cold sore to me. I’m ashamed to admit we haven’t talked about it since. I was hoping to figure out what’s going on with me before confronting her about it.

I shined a flashlight and they do have a bit of a lighter colored shine to them. Not a full white head or anything though. I didn’t try squeezing them as I’m concerned with making it worse and then not being able to tell if it’s HSV, but it doesn’t seem like they would pop if i did try. ### Could you possibly let me know what they say when you hear back? ### Yeah actually, you could be correct. I guess that’s preferable to herpes…? I have no idea. I will see a dermatologist though.

Pretty upsetting either way :( ### You need to get tested. But its kinda tough to tell maybe more they are not it. ### I'd get cheilitis sometimes and I used to always think it's herpes.

thq1w9,"I genuinely do not want to live Before I start I have to clarify that my feelings are not just about herpes, I had a very troybled upbringing and life and this is just the final nail in the coffin.

I found out from a partner I slept with I gave her herpes, she had not had a partner in a very long time  except me and she has zero reason to lie and I know its the truth. The mental anguish of knowing I gave her genital herpes has messed me up for quite a while and recently I have researched it and realised my chance at love or casual sex is literally gone.

I undeestand there are females out there who can still get partners while disclosing but trust me for guys it is much, much harder. I have heard how women discuss herpes, checked online polls and most women clearly say it is not worth the risk. I am not a model, or succeseful so I do not bring enough to the table to even out the scales. 

I do not mean to offend anybody, I just can not cope with the fact due to bad luck my chances of finding a partner or love has lowered so much and I may as well say good bye to casual sex.

It just feels like God is knocking down every part of my life one by one as he needs me to die, abusive childhood to mess up my personality, having me vanish for years with my Dad to mess up my education, giving me severe insomnia amd mental health issues to mess up my job and worklife and now this to ruin my sex and love life.


I am going to go speak to my mental health doctor this week but I do not see my self living for much longer which is fine as I have came to terms with it.",47,2022-03-19 03:28:05-04:00,"I felt very, very similar to this when I found out just over a year ago. I’m a woman and I found out I had it while with someone who did not. I honestly didn’t want to live either. I also have a troubled upbringing and very bad depression. It didn’t work out with that guy but for other reasons. 

The next guy I met had genital HSV-2 and I have genital HSV-1. He had it much longer than I did and really coached me through life with it. I didn’t see out another “infected” but it was just luck I suppose. He told me that it is a bit harder to have connections with women but believe me, he’s far from celibate. He’s not unbelievably good looking but he’s an average guy with a decent cute face, ya know. That didn’t work out for us but he’s happily in a relationship now with someone without herpes. I also know quite a few women in relationships with herpes positive men. 

What I’m trying to convey is that everything seems worse in the beginning. It is SO hard. But it gets better I promise. You’ll get the occasional person who shoots you down or ghosts you or says something terribly mean but your skin gets thicker. You are not your disease. You deserve love and happiness and everything anyone else does. Take it day by day. I know even unrelated issues in life seem worse currently, that’s how I felt. I already had this, this, and this wrong AND NOW I HAVE HERPES?! What did I do to deserve this? Or why me? Can I not get a break? But it will get better as cliche as that is to say and as much as it’s probably not so helpful to you currently. Try seeking out therapy or psychiatry depending on what else in going on in your life. A positive attitude and mindset will change your whole world. And just always try to remember… YOU ARE NOT YOUR DISEASE. I hope you find peace with your diagnosis soon my friend. I see you and I feel for you. ### Dude. Dating is no more difficult post diagnosis. Own your shit. Learn the facts. Disclose. It’s simple. Hsv is not a big deal. Everyone has it or is uneducated about it. The shear amount of women I’d have encountered who straight don’t give a shit has been mind blowing. Don’t get in your head about this. You are still a stone cold pimp. ### If u are thinking of suicide ur not alone I thought if it too after getting herpes. But write down ur bucket list , implement it b4 u die...chances are that it may prolong ur life or u may abandon suicide like me. Also u too didn't create herpes but some 1 gave u so if u have passed it unintentionally so be it. That's life ### I don’t know if this will make you feel better but it can lay dormant in someone for years. My therapist told me about couple who were married for 30+ years and one randomly started showing herpes symptoms thinking the other one had cheated. It can literally stay dormant for years so it might not necessarily be you who gave it. 

Also, please hang in there. Please. ### Hey! It sounds like you have depression. Definitely see a professional and see if medication/therapy is beneficial.  I also had a very rough child hood, and was drinking and doing drugs to cope with untreated trauma and depression.  I'm sober now but just tested positive for hsv2, and I'm really ok with it. A little confused bc I think it's oral but not freaking out. However 6, 7 years ago I would've been in your shoes. Please know that this diagnosis is not a big deal. Yes some women might have a bad reaction but you shouldn't be disclosing anything until you SEE their full panel results. Most people have a form of hsv. If you did not see your previous partners negative test BEFORE sex there is zero proof you gave it to her. Especially if you're asymptomatic ### Us women honestly do not have it that much easier I promise. I’ve had plenty rejection from men and have yet to sleep with anyone since diagnosis, for nervousness reasons and the fact the few guys I liked weren’t ok with my diagnosis but that’s ok, obviously wasn’t meant to happen. But Please get some mental health help❤️ you WILL be ok and you CAN live a normal happy life ❤️ ### I feel the same way ### Please get help. Don't bring urself down over this. Seek help. There's plp out there living with deadly illnesses and chose to continue fighting. Don't ever give up. If ur kind, honest and with a good heart then those are good qualities that u bring to the table. Focus on work and a hobbie, keep ur mind busy. Live life to the fullest and enjoy urself. Give urself sometime to heal and everything else will soon fall into place. Hugs. ### You don't know yet that you gave her anything. Others have already said that there is a decent possibility you didn't. Just test. 

As to women dating a partner with herpes, I did. I got herpes from a man I knew had it. We dated for 6 years before I got it - a long term, serious relationship. We didn't work out for reasons that had nothing to do with herpes, and I don't regret it at all. 

I'm sorry your life has been so troubled, but don't make plans based on things that haven't happened yet, and things you are only guessing about. Talk to your doctors, and test. The rest will work itself out. You've made it through every shitty day so far, you'll make it through this, right? The world needs you in it. ### Herpes will literally never kill you and is not a catastrophic disease. It's a fucking cold that maybe comes around a few times a year. Why are you depressed? You know how many people get cold sores on their lips? Do you see them jumping off Bridges? Like there are people with serious diseases who have serious problems. ### It’s not about being a model or successful; not every women is like that. Please seek professional help and I’m praying you overcome this tough situation you’re going through. BUT ITS OKAY. There’s dating site for people with herpes. It’s not the end of the world. I was diagnosed at 17 and not once did I think the world was going to end. Once again, you can get passed it 💗 ### Dude I got it after cheating on my wife (I'm a sex addict) I told her, I signed over everything in her name bombed 4 xanny bars and drunk almost a handle of jack. I could feel my body fighting it but I couldn't even move, and honestly I didn't give a fuck because of the benzos. We have children also. I survived but I could feel myself dying. Don't fucking do it, I promise it gets better. ### I felt the same when I was diagnosed, that was about 6 years ago. I’ve also struggled with my mental health my entire life & didn’t have a great upbringing, & I’ve been in a lot of toxic relationships so the diagnosis didn’t help my whole well being. I’ve been with a handful of people since then & as far as I know I haven’t passed it on to anybody, but I do take daily antivirals so that lowers the risk. I dealt with one negative reaction from a man who was the first person I tried to date after my diagnosis but my first actual boyfriend after I was diagnosed also had HSV1, nobody I’ve been with after him had it but everyone has been ok with it. I still have a really hard time talking about it with someone I hope to be with. Rejection is scary. I’m a woman & I’ve also heard it’s easier for women than for men but the way I see it, it’s so common & even if you aren’t able to be with someone who’s HSV negative (which I don’t think is realistic but I understand that feeling), you’ll run into someone who’s HSV positive sooner or later. The worst part about this is the stigma but you’re not alone. Hope things get easier for you.

Edit: just wanted to add, I’ve ALWAYS disclosed & never been intimate with anybody if I even THINK I may be having an outbreak, & as far as I know I haven’t passed it on to anybody I’ve been with who is HSV negative… & condoms also weren’t always used. Medication is a very personal thing & not easy for everyone to have access to but being on daily antivirals has helped me a lot in being able to live with this. ### Try to keep pushing <3 ### I remember when I first got eye floaters I cried like a maniac and thought I would never enjoy life again, that a beautiful sky will look like shit, ect. 15 years later I wouldn’t even pay big money if a cure was available. I am no more unhappy because of these floaters. Humans adapt and you will too give it time…your fear of a newfound difficulty to have casual sex is a lizard brained evolutionary quirk designed to get us to want to reproduce as much as possible, that fear you have will dissipate in time as your rational brain realizes this isn’t the crisis you think it is…everything you need to be happy in life you still have at your disposal. ### I feel the same way ### It’s okay I have hsv1 and hsv2 recently diagnosed I ruin myself after I broke up with my ex and I try to come back to my ex and she said that that’s what I get for sleeping with other people,after we broke up I needed sex but I never thought I would catch something I’m very young and now my life is ruined not only because herpes because so many dreams and goals I had aren’t so reachable my ex was the best thing that ever happened to me after we broke up my life went to hell I’m still here trying to cope with it,just know it’s not easy but maybe will get through it I don’t know where I’m going in life at the moment but I really want someone to love me but who’s gonna love me? My 2 and a half relationship is destroyed I got hsv my life is not as good I don’t know what I want to be in life I’m 21 I still live with my parents my ex is younger than me she made her life she lives on her own with her friends and works a dentist assistant or something like that but all I’m saying life is so hard and I don’t know if I want to live as well just know if no one told you,your not alone and I love you from human to human. ### I am a female 23 just diagnosed last week and i feel like i am not going to ever have a normal life.. maybe us people with herpes can have a normal life together? ### And please seek help. This world is worth you being here. We need you. ### Hang in there I’ve felt that way too got it 3months ago but it gets better my guy ### [removed] ### Feel the exact same way. I’ve had 8 partners since diagnosis and have only disclosed it to 10. People really don’t care especially when they are educated on the topic. ### Thanka for the reply

It would be a huge amount of coincidences if she had it for years and stayed dormant then as soon as we had sex she got a really bad outbreak. I feel so bad even though I did not know and have had zero symptoms ### I bet none of those guys have been tested for herpes and more than half carry the virus already. Next time ask to see THEIR results 1st. ### I was diagnosed about 3 months ago. I cried so hard my eyes were swollen shut, then I got educated and I’m in a healthy relationship with someone who is aware of the risks. It’s not that easy for everyone though. You and me, as well as others may know hsv isn’t that big of a deal, but to some it is. And it’s okay to let them vent out how they’re feeling. No need to belittle someone because you don’t agree with how they react towards their own situation. We’re all here for some sort of support after all. ### You can absolutely have a normal life. Literally way more people have herpes than don't. When I used to test negative for both hsv1 and 2 my doctor says he rarely EVER sees that.  I think over 80% of people have some form of herpes. Most ,however live in ignorant bliss bc they've never been tested and are asymptomatic or symptoms are so mild they mistake it for a pimple or rash or razor burn. Do not let this get you down. I hate that I wasted any time feeling sad over a super common, non life threatening skin blister. There are SO many diseases  that are MUCH worse . Cancer, HIV, parkinsins, diabetes, MS, meningitis,  hepatitis,  osteoporosis..... Also do NOT. I repeat DO NOT disclose your herpes status until you SEE a full panel std test from your potential partner. ### Hey man just get tested before concluding you have it. igG is the preferred way for your situation ### That’s a real possibility :) ### This is how it happened for me! And who I was with was negative! ### I'm not trying to be mean here. It basically has little to no impact on your physical health. Anything mental health wise is on you. So many people have HSV-1 and HSV-2. You're flipping out over the reputation of the disease rather than what it physically does to your body. Think about that. The reputation. It's dumb.

Due yourself a favor. Cheer the fuck up. Millions have it. If someone doesn't want to touch you because of, then you're better off. Look at this as a good screening test for those who are real and those who you need to toss to the side. Move on with your life. ### I am also worrying until the person i think gave it to me gets a test that it has been dormant in me for years. ### Can i ask why you say not to disclose? How can i go about navigating that especially with kissing? ### Thank you for reminding me normal people get this. I’m a 23 F and freaking out. Thank you. ### I was all sad and throwing a pity party when I got diagnosed and someone told me to get the fuck over it. It's a fucking cold sore! I have a roof over my head, I'm healthy, I have enough to eat , that puts me better off than alot of people on earth. There are people dying of incurable diseases, starvation, war etc and here in the US we wanna jump off a bridge over a maybe 2x a year pimple. It's absurd and I'm glad someone told me that. It's what I needed to hear. ### Like I said you and me and others are aware of what it truly is. But for someone who’s just joining the world of herpes it can be scary. OP already mentioned going to talk to their mental health professional about it all. But telling them to just get over it is like telling a mad person to calm down lmao people are gonna feel how they’re gonna feel. The most someone can do is just be informative. Like you said millions have it ### Do you have hsv 1 or 2? And is it genital or oral? ### Exactly. Some don't even have breakouts for years. This is nothing in comparison. ### No, they going to feel like this because you keep reinforcing the notion it's scary. It's not. You know what's scary? Fucking cancer. Stop promoting it's a big scary disease. It's not. Jesus. ### I am unsure of if it is 1 or 2 but it is genital only. ### People are letting the big pharma companies who created the stigma win
  Doctors refuse to test for it bc the stigma is so ridiculous.  It is a rash...a pimple...a blister. And most times NOTHING AT ALL. Ohhhh no I have to tell every person I date or sleep with. Um...no you don't. If you have HIV or something life threatening then yes, disclose. Other than that. Sex is risky. Life is risky. If ppl truly never want to be exposed to diseases  they need to live in solitude in the woods and never be around another human ### I said it can be scary, not that it IS scary. Being told you have something incurable isn’t fun. Then you see a doctor, you do your research, you talk to people. THAT is when you realize you’ll be fine. They’re just venting, then seeing a professional. I see no problem in getting your feelings out. And this diagnosis isn’t the only thing troubling them so there’s also that. Anyway, I’m not interested in any sort of argument. Just stating that people are allowed to feel however they want. Sooo have a good night 👋 ### Ok. Then that means you cannot spread it by kissing. You can only spread it by skin to skin contact and it's not on your mouth. I would suggest abloid test to determine the type. ### You know what else is incurable? The common cold. Stop trying to sell this notion a cold on your private parts is or can be scary. It's scary because you overreact to a silly disease that basically does nothing. It's dumb. ### I am in the process of getting a new doctor. The only thing mine did right was diagnose the herpes. The rest was shite. I thank you for the information… i feel better about at least being able to share a kiss normally. I don’t want to have sex ever again. I feel violated. ### 100% this ### ",20,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/thq1w9/i_genuinely_do_not_want_to_live/
thwljs,"Worried I made a mistake and obsessing to the point of breakdown. How long can prodrome last? Bit of a background story to start. So a friend of mine 32(f) just had her first genital herpes outbreak ever. I 32(m) have been consoling her and trying to support her. By the time she went to the doctors her swab tests came back negative and the doctor said it’s because the sores had already begun to heal but they were sure it was herpes. They said to wait until her next outbreak to determine what type so as of now no confirmation as to what type she has. She was feeling most of what I see here, depression, worried she would never be able to date again or have sex, and feeling really bad. She expressed to me that because she couldn’t have sex it was making her affection and sex starved. She asked if I would feel comfortable using toys on her and I said as long as I don’t have to penetrate her myself, sure. 

I went into this not fully informed and thinking that because she had a negative swab test that must mean she’s not currently contagious but have since learned I was incorrect. I used a dildo on her and for a brief moment I even rubbed her clitoris with my thumb. I could not see any visual marks or signs of herpes. I took a brief moment to go wash my hands and return and continued to use a dildo on her. I asked if it was ok if I masterbated so we could finish together and she said yes. We both finished, cleaned up and then a little later she left. After I came back down to earth and started thinking about things more I started reading up and realizing that she most likely could still be very contagious and I began to worry about cross contamination on my hands and then touching my penis. I feel like my hands definitely got fluids on them at times but we were using plenty of lubricant and I’m not positive if it was lube or her fluids. 

I began to worry really bad that I had mad a mistake. And that worry spiraled into a full on hypochondriac episode. A day later I began to feel tingling on my penis under the head mostly on the left side and I wouldn’t describe it as burning but I could definitely feel a sensation when I peed. I am stuck between hyper fixating on what I feel and trying to determine if it’s the incubation and prodrome kicking in or if I irritated myself by washing my hands with bath and body works foaming soap before masterbating and then also using a little of that soap directly on my penis afterwards. It’s now been 5 days since the encounter and I still feel the sensation come and go. I’ve been having some of the worst anxiety and have not been able to eat or sleep properly and I work a physically demanding job and I’ve felt awful. 

I guess my question is, is it possible to experience prodrome symptoms for 5 straight days with no visible marks. I would describe what I’m feeling as a tingly irritated sensation on my left side under the head that comes and goes. I sometimes feel a little sensation and maybe the slightest slightest burn when I pee (if my pee is yellow) and I’ve even felt pressure in my testicles for 2 short moments the last 2 days. Does this sound like prodrome? Are prodrome symptoms constant or do they fade in and out? I have brief moments of feeling nothing/normal and can’t tell if my anxiety is making me hyperfocused on what I’m feeling or if I did give myself irritation and sensitivity from soap. 

I see that without an initial outbreak I’ll have to wait the duration of the incubation period to a)see if there an outbreak and b)won’t have antibodies for a blood test until at the very very earliest 12 days after initial contact, and I’m aware in most cases it’s much longer. I have a doctors appointment coming up which puts me at 14 days after initial contact and this wait and see is giving me some of the worst anxiety I’ve had in years. I just want input from someone who has any insight to provide. I was just trying to be a good friend and supportive and make her feel like she will always be accepted but now feel like I may have made a mistake by not doing my due diligence as to how to safely go about sexual encounters with her. I’m definitely feeling things and have convinced myself I cross contaminated myself even though I know there’s a good chance it’s soap irritation. I don’t know what is rational and irrational at this point and the wait is killing me.",2,2022-03-19 10:41:18-04:00,"I think your anxiety is making you hyper focused. I do think because you washed your hands with soap and water you should be okay 😊 ### So you touched her with your thumb and the dildo? Your mouth and genitals never touched her genitals? 

You're fine. There's no risk here. Even if you touched her, then touched yourself, there was lube and time and movement and air and such, and there's no risk. ### ",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/thwljs/worried_i_made_a_mistake_and_obsessing_to_the/
thxhcv,"Am I missing something? The girl I’m seeing and I are both HSV-1 and HSV-2 positive. I understand that refraining from physical intimacy/sex during outbreaks is the recommended practice. 

But seeing as both of us already have both forms of HSV—is there really even any point in refraining from sexual activity? As long as the symptoms are not painful for either of us, am I correct to assume there isn’t really much else at stake if we decide to be sexually active through outbreaks? 

I base this on the notion that you can’t catch HSV again once you already have it, and that re-exposure to HSV will not trigger an outbreak.

ti439q,"Odd of a false positive Heard some rumors about a girl I was with possibly having herpes. We had sex once back in November, once in January and then recently at the beginning of March and that’s when I heard the rumors. I have had no symptoms at all my whole life and when I got checked on Friday I was negative (<.90) for HSV 1 and had a 1.31 on the index for HSV 2. It was the HSV igg blood test.

It could also mean that you have a new infection and your numbers will rise. 

Instead of listening to what could easily be vicious, vicious rumors, have you simply asked your partner respectfully if the rumors are true? 

She might get cold sores, and people could have run with that and said ""omg she has herpes"", and while that's true, you are here with a very different picture of what you think that means. It might not be true at all. 

Have you had a discussion with her about STD risk/prevention? Did you use condoms? 

If she tests and is negative, that can go a long way to figuring out what you need to do next, too. Don't accuse her, just have a gentle, adult discussion. ### I did ask her about it and she said it was not true and the rumors are from her ex and of course I believe her over him but I got tested out of an over abundance of caution. Our first time was back in November and then again in January, would my numbers not be way higher by now from those encounters? I have had 0 symptoms and this whole experience has made me regret ever even getting tested ### Okay, you said your most recent time was in March - is that correct? 

Yes, if you got it in Nov or Jan, your numbers would probably be higher. If you got it in March, which you said your most recent encounter was, it might not be. 

False positives like this are why a lot of people discourage testing with no symptoms, but see what happens at 6 or 12 weeks. I wouldn't test more often.

Im not dealing with the stigma for a hypocrite ### I think you should tho if they haven’t been tested recently with hsv. But you absolutely right ### After now being diagnosed I am so upset with the “he/she/they look clean”. My partner looked clean… and here I am with lidocaine on my rear end taking medication and knowing you cannot trust looks. You need to test. ### Yes yes YES! I have OCD and was a former drug user/alcoholics and I've been sober for years, but I hear it in the addiction recovery too. Oh YOUVE BEEN CLEAN 7 years??! No! I've been clean my whole life. Now I don't use alcohol or cocaine. 🙄 ### Hahahaha the sniffles one is hilarious ### Yes! Until a few months ago I was testing negative for both hsv 1 and 2 and my doctor said he double checked bc it's SO extremely rare for anyone over 18 to test negative for both. So , yea people have been conditioned to hear ""herpes"" and freak out, not know cold sores are herpes and many ,many people with both types are asymptomatic and have never been tested ### ",10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/thhdid/do_people_just_trust_someones_sti_status_without/

thkoco,"How contagious is it to yourself. Hi. I’m sorry to bother. New here and diagnosed yesterday. My doctor was horrible. She barely consoled me, didn’t really give me a ton of information and just kinda left the room after saying go get your blood test down the hall now. No anything about you’ll receive your results in so and so days no I’m sorry nothing. Anyways, she told me that if i sit down in the shower with my lesions and then my sister goes to take a shower later and sits down that she will contract it if i don’t clean the tub. 

She basically scared me into never having anything touch the lesions that will touch elsewhere. I have been self in wearing gloves when I wipe when I pee and gloves when I put lidocaine on the sores. I’m just so scared of spreading it. 

I don’t even need to worry about sex because I’ve decided I’m abstinent the rest of my life. I am beating myself up so so super hard about this. Just trying to make sure me and my friends and fam are as healthy as can be. Fuck men honestly. (No i know not everybody but you would say it too!!) All my diagnosis has really shown me is that i failed myself in focusing on myself and getting me where I needed to be. 

Now… this is what I have to live with for the rest of my life. I have many regrets. Trying to find some optimism and positivity in all this but it’s a little hard… maybe because it’s been just two days knowing it is really what it is. 

I can’t even say it man. Jesus. Thanks for the help anyways.",13,2022-03-18 21:42:04-04:00,"The risk of passing it to yourself is negligible after a few months; your body develops antibodies. 

Your doctor didn’t give you much practical guidance.. Google the Herpes Handbook or read about it from the CDC or WHO for a better idea of what you’re living with and how many others have it. 

I have a date where my herpes self is going to have some amazing sex with a partner who knows and accepts I have it or I’d write more. Peace! ### Sorry your going this right now , I am only a month since being diagnosed. I kinda of felt the same, its up and down some days. For me what kept my spirits up is reading about new research for cures for Hsv. Alot of good info at r/HerpesCureResearch good luck friend! ### Hi, herpes is a really common thing 1 in 10 people have hsv 2 and alot more have hsv 1 and it does not cause any health complications unless your immune system is really compromised. Herpes increases the risk to contact HIV and females already have a higher risk of contracting any std then men. It is a skin desease and people just asume its really bad due to the advertisement of the pharmaceutical companies.Altho the ob can be uneasy to look at and can cause discomfort usually they become less painful and much less often over time. You cannot spread the virus thru toilet seats etc as the virus cannot survive longer outside a living body but can be passed if you share lipsticks, share food with same spoon or share towels etc for hsv1 and for hsv 2 direct skin to skin contact or sharing towels. your family members are really less likely to contract hsv from you, but take extra precautions during obs rest they even dont need to know you have it. And most people with hsv have a active sexual life with patner who donot have it and they dont pass it on. So no need to giveup on anything or let anyone tell you othewise cause you got this Just take meds as prescribed by ur doc!
Plus im a man and 22 i got hsv when i was 21 by a girl i am not saying fuck all girls so stay positive cuz thats the only key if you stress yourself it can be a cause of a ob, i mean it is what it is plus with medication use black seed oil i just started using it after i read a finding that it can deactivate hsv1 it did not mention hsv2 but i think it works the same but the oil cannot eliminate the virus!
May you have a blessed and healthy life ahead! ### I also had a really horrible encounter with a doctor. Asked do I know what herpes is, I responded yes and then they left the room. Do have a look at peoples experience. Herpes.co.uk is good. And maybe try a sexual health clinic instead. What I’ve heard it does get better! I know it’s probably all you can think about but when you are physically able, try to do the things you love with the people you love! That’s the key! ### By the way Jesus was/is a man...so fuck men may be not so good. I got it from a woman....what hurts me she is not the type I consider hot...that is the  painful part. I have always declined sex with very hot ladies for fear of STIs then boom....some casual sex with below average chic...I was venting....

The medical drs signed an agreement to have all human race infected with herpes that's why they don't screen for such a horrible disease but only test once u get it..,fuck them all...

By the end of 6 months u will be  focusing on controlling outbreaks than how u got it....

I wish u well on celibacy....but I can't promise that....well I have Ghsv 1. ### Itssafe for you to clean toilet seats and places you sit barebottom without panties/shorts. Its also good if you use a separate towel for your privates versus rest of body (i say this for everyone not only us with herpes)

Also, i have been with someone who was accepting of my herpes diagnosis so dont worry darling. 

For me i just think well im otherwise healthy like i dont have terminal illnesses like cancer , diabetes, high blood pressure (knock on wood). So all we gotta do is keep ourselves healthy to avoid breakouts

Please find another OB whos perhaps younger? My first OB made me feel rly bad before so im glad shes dead lol she was very old. Now my OB is late 20s and is very open to talk ###

I hope your sex is amazing! And thanks for giving me hope :) I’m crying ### That’s true. I think I’m just in the denial angry whatever stage. Not entirely sure yet. I really am glad i found this Reddit and there are people like you to help and talk about it. I feel better knowing you’re 22. Hearing everyone talk about their sexual experiences gives me hope my life won’t be completely fucked up later. 

I’m not even worried about *sex* right now it’s just the idea that like sex is what normal people do and I’m worried so terribly about disclosure and everything. I don’t handle rejection well, so this will be a new battle in the future. Again, I’m so not worried about it right now… just saying it all scares me. 

Every minute of the day i think about every scenario ever in my life. Past and present and future. I keep replaying getting my diagnosis (I have PTSD so the replay button in my brain is used to doing it) and I am thinking about my future every possible instance this will effect. 

I’m just trying to… I don’t know. Get comfortable. I think if I wasn’t in the middle of a horrible disgusting outbreak I would feel better. Well, I have the rest of my life to work on that haha so. 

You are right too, I should not say fuck all men. I am really upset with this person because he is not understanding the gravity of it. Not even the basic science “how do you know it won’t go away”…. Buddy. Cmon. ### Ha. I don’t know that I believe in Jesus! Perhaps I should come up with another word. 

And believe me… i feel you on your sentiments. Where i contracted it is not my “preferred” if you will? Like… I just shouldn’t have even been in the situation and yet my dumb fucking ass was and now my dumb fucking ass is a sore one :(. ### To make sure you have the correct Herpes Handbook, [it's here](https://westoverheights.com/herpes/the-updated-herpes-handbook/). 

Your doctor sucks, and you should find a new one. 

&#x200B;

>Anyways, she told me that if i sit down in the shower with my lesions and then my sister goes to take a shower later and sits down that she will contract it if i don’t clean the tub.

NO. The only way you'll transmit it to anyone in your house is if you have unclothed, genital to genital contact with them. 

&#x200B;

>She basically scared me into never having anything touch the lesions that will touch elsewhere. I have been self in wearing gloves when I wipe when I pee and gloves when I put lidocaine on the sores. I’m just so scared of spreading it.

Gloves aren't a horrible idea when you have the first outbreak, because your skin is just so open and raw, and touching it can introduce other bacteria into it, and no one wants that. 

As u/HappyArtichoke111 already said, once you get antibodies, spreading it to other areas is really not a concern. The only areas you have to be concerned with now are your mouth, nose and eyes - mucus membranes. 

You don't need to swear off sex forever. I understand the sentiment, but don't even worry about that right now. The Handbook has a bunch of transmission info, should you decide to give men another chance lol, but that can come later. I'm sure sex isn't on your To Do list right now. 

Don't beat yourself up. If you got covid or strep, or something, would you be this angry with yourself? Getting herpes isn't a personal failure. It's literally just a virus. 

I'm glad you got the lidocaine. If your doctor gave you that, that's about the only thing I like. 

The blood tests - do you know what they were? It should be an IgG type specific. The Handbook explains the IgM. I bet money that's what your doctor ordered, and those suck. 

Hang in there. :) ### Yeah always remember to willingly help others, As i said do ur research if you like on black seed oil it has great effects on brain hence improves your mental health, as for herpes there is no cure and it will remain with a person once they contract it,as the virus tends to hind inside cells and the immune system cannot detect the virus when it is hiding, many vaccine have been created but none used for human trials, but this is not a reason to freak out as there are medications that can help you with obs aswell as suppressing the virus and reducing the risk of transmission.
Have a blessed and healthy life! :) ### ",6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/thkoco/how_contagious_is_it_to_yourself/
thrr9b,Question about seeing someone who might have Herpes… I’m currently talking to and very interested in a girl that I know has slept with someone that has Herpes. He’s a decent friend of mine but her and I have been talking recently and I’m really into her. They were just fuck buddies and he gave me the 100% okay to go for it. I haven’t talked to her about it yet and I also haven’t really asked him in too much detail about the medication he takes or if he uses protection. I’m basically in a situation where she could potentially have it. I’m tempted to ask for a negative test from her to be on the safe side but I don’t want to come off offensive. I would also like to clarify I do not mean to offend anyone by posting this. Purely just looking for information because I know little about the subject.

thbvk8,"newly diagnosed HSV2 I'm so tired of men who tell me they can't cum with a condom on, then look at me like it's my job to accommodate. I'm tired of men who never test themselves because they don't have symptoms. I'm tired of male friends judging me because I haven't found the right person and been able to maintain a long term relationship. I'm tired of being blamed when I've been told by every partner that they're clean and I've always provided condoms only to to have the guy remove them when my back is turned. 

I've had myself tested every year. I used to be a sex worker. When I was a SW, men never took the condom off and only once did a client ask to try uncovered. He was immediately denied and I never saw him again. Four years past, four years of clean tests and not working as a SW and unsuccessfully dating, I test positive after seeing two men who swore they were negative because their previous partners tested negative, but they didn't get tested. I was weak and thought I was in the monogamous relationship that might be the one. I've contacted both of them and they're trying to blame me. 

I'm trying to date again and it's so hard to tell someone before having sex that I'm HSV2 positive. I've never had an OB, but I take valtrex daily. I always have condoms available. I feel like I'm the dirty one now. That I can't find anyone who will use protection or want me after I tell them I'm positive.",44,2022-03-18 14:34:29-04:00,"Oh I hear you!! I am 43. Only had sex with 3 guys without condoms. They were tested before we stopped using condoms... which now I find completely ridiculous because they dont test for hsv2 with a standard checkup. In most cases they only test when you have an outbreak.

Was diagnosed 18 months ago. The guy who gave it to me told me he has had symptoms most of his life but never got tested. Always thought it was a rash. Still didnt get tested for hsv when he had symptoms. Most men dont care. 

My beef is with the medical community that dont test for hsv2 in the standard checkup. You would think that testing for an STD that cant be cured would be a top priority but no. And if most of the population have it maybe it would be great that the asymptomatic lucky bastards join the club. It would remove the stigma and make it less like the plague for those who have symptoms. ### Most men DONT CARE. i told the man who gave it to me and he was so focused on saying “you don’t even know for real yet” I’m like there is a result on it’s way and my doctor looked at my outbreak! He is so dead set on not getting test. I feel horrible for other women in the world he will hurt. I don’t know what to do. He refuses to believe it is real… but it is real. ### You never had an OB? I assume you were not tested with the swab test? Which test was it?
I have never had a visible OB. I had to point where it hurt and they swab that spot. Never had visible sores but it hurt like a sob. ### I am right there with you.. And still completely in shock. ### im sorry take some time to urself an come to terms with it before u think of tryin to date it can be difficult ive had it 4 years now painful amount of rejection ### Same except women. 😑 ### Always lose my boner when I use condoms. 

Would you say that contracting hsv2 was a price worth paying for having an active sex life with multiple partners? Considering that condom use does not prevent HSv2 transmission by a significant margin like it does with pregnancies and you can’t really trust people you just met with being squeaky clean and std tests usually don’t even test for hsv2 ### I'm so sorry you had to experience that level of apathy and stupidity. That's the type of person who should be legally procecuted for their ignorance. ### It's a blood test for both HSV1 and 2. You have to specifically ask for it ### I haven't had symptoms and I take valtrex, lysine, vit and B100 daily. I'm over the shock and working on treatment. I'm still working through emotions of how it's going to affect my future. ### How do you protect yourself? Have you been with the same partner all your life? What a ridiculous question you pose, is it worth the price...Let's be real. Humans do not mate for life. Everyone here except for maybe the younger people have had multiple partners.

I would specifically request for HSV1 and 2 testing and I know how to read the test reports which I have printed and filed for my records. I would much prefer if I had found a partner to stay monogamous with. I would have preferred it if I didn't resort to being a sex worker, although if I hadn't done that I wouldn't have finished my degree and become a happy scientist. 

I've noticed it's the men who loose their boners with condoms who are usually the most unlikely to be regularly tested and quick to slut shame when they have had just as many partners as the women they are denigrating. ### What were your results? Do you have the index values? 

If you don't, ask if you can get them. Make sure it was a type specific IgG blood test, and that your index values were above a 3.5. If they weren't, or maybe if they were, because you have no symptoms, you might have a false positive. ### Oh no. You shouldnt have asked. Thats what I learned from the whole thing. The medical community says regarding hsv, ignorance is bliss. You were asymptomatic like 3/4 of the population. Thats what we get for taking care of our health and the health of others. I am so sorry. 

When I went to the hospital for the blood test - I requested it as we after my first ob. The nurse didnt even know how to code it in the system. Had to ask another nurse who didnt know as well. They never do it. I live in Canada. ### I used condoms sometimes mainly to avoid pregnancy risk with my girlfriend. Dated her for several years in my early 20s. First sexual partner. Then broke up and never entered a relationship again with someone else. I’m in my mid 30s now. Always used protection when having sex with someone new but that was rarely. Maybe once a year lol. Recently started getting a lot of attention from women. I’m just getting out more since I no longer need to work for a living. But the risk of stds, especially herpes because of the stigma, bothers me a lot. I just feel like I don’t really have much sexual experience to settle down with a girl.

I think you are bound to have herpes if you have sex with multiple partners throughout your life even if you use condoms. It doesn’t lower the risk much. So would you still do it? or would you rather live a mostly celibate life as long as you don’t catch herpes? Other stds don’t count since they’re curable and although hiv is incurable you are much more unlikely to catch it unless you are a gay or bisexual man. ### My index value was 4.9, followed up with a Western blot and another test a month later. 😥

I started daily Valtrex, lysine, vit D and B100 when I tested positive. I have an IUD so my hormones don't fluctuate as much. ### You aren't super educated on herpes. I'm not 100% either but was just diagnosed with hsv2. I'm 34. I've had 9 partners in my life, count em 9, all told me they were tested and good to go. 1 in 6 people have hsv2 and nearly 70% of the population has hvs 1 aka the common cold sore. Guess what that can be genital too. 

Up to 90% of hsv2 posistive people are unaware they have it because they are asymptomatic. Women have double, yes twice as likely to contract it. So on top of bleeding once a month and constant fluctuating hormones that we live with, you men once again get it easier in the sense you only have a 10% chance of catching hsv2 from your female partner over the year. If she's taking daily antivirals that gets cut in half. Women are also more likely to have flares and be symptomatic... every month our periods can trigger an out break because our hormones are all over the place. 

To sit here and say she basically asked for herpes by enjoying her sex life you are ignorant and my biggest fear with this diagnosis. You saying the stigma bothers you a lot is a big part of why the stigma exists...

Women are more harshly judged about everything and even more so when it comes to stds when reality is that at the end of the day it's twice as easy for us to be infected... ### [deleted] ### I see now you're question is from genuine curiosity. I responded from the bitter mental place I'm currently residing in. It does seem like HSV is an eventuality with its prevalence and stigma. I believe the stigma is to blame for the prevalence since it makes people unwilling to admit they have it.

Since I don't have symptoms, it's easy for me to say that it was worth it. I'm sure others would respond differently. I would not want to live a life of abstinence after experiencing the joy from intimacy and sex. ### Oh, so you've already had all the tests. 🥺

If you're not having outbreaks, there's not a lot of need for anything other than Valtrex to reduce transmission. Studies are mixed, at best, at what lysine does for herpes, though some swear by it, but if it does anything, it reduces outbreaks. It does nothing for transmission. 

Women are often low in vit D, so I won't say anything about that lol, and I haven't heard much about the B100 and herpes. None of it reduces transmission - only valtrex does that. Supplements don't. 

If they make you feel better, then by all means, take them. If it's ever a matter of finances, and you're wondering what matters most, the Valtrex does, since you don't have outbreaks, if your goal is transmission reduction. ### I’m aware of the statistics you cited. I don’t understand why you think I’m slut shaming her. I never said she was a bad person for her life choices. However, given the prevalence of hsv1 and hsv2 it seems like an eventuality if you lead an active sex life with multiple partners. In fact I actually think the same way as her, as it is worth it.

The stigma bothers me not because of my own judgments about it but the judgements of others. Seeing how many people in Reddit respond badly to hsv2 diagnosis. 

I wouldn’t have a problem dating someone with hsv2 or hsv1 in their genitals even if they chose not to tell me about it due to the stigma, as long as they were being careful about it. Like taking antivirals or at least not having sex with me when they have an open sore. I do hope though that at some point they would tell me about it. But I understand why they would be hesitant to tell me in the beginning. ### With all the risks out there, it seems men care the least and more likely to spread since they're less likely to contract diseases and less likely to show symptoms or get tested regularly. ### There’s a vaccine for hpv now. And even the high risk strains that can cause cancer, which are few, have a low rate of causing cancer. ### Thanks for your candid answer ### I think the prevalence is mainly due to the fact people are more promiscuous than ever, and plenty don't use protection. STD's overall are up, not just herpes. And if they're asymptomatic, they don't even know they have it because it's not tested in regular screenings, so they'll continue to bang whoever they wish, spreading it around. 

I definitely have a different relationship and view of intimacy now than I did in the past. I contracted this during a monogamous relationship, and I can't say for certain that the woman gave it to me (we both tested positive after I had my first outbreak), but I regret my sexual encounters in the past now, because that's how I was exposed to this. I should have been more conservative and waited for a person who didn't have a history of casual dating. ### Bruh you ARE slut shaming her ### “I should have been more conservative and waited for a person who didn’t have a history of casual dating”

That’s the problem. In this day and age what are the odds of finding such a person past a certain age? Given the health consequences of hsv2, other than the psychological ones, I think the issue is overblown.

I tried not to get covid for as long as I could. Didn’t get out of my house for two years lol. Triple vaxxed. Double masked everywhere. Finally one vacation with my family to ny and we all got covid. Would I do it again. Yes. You only live once. You are only young and healthy once. What’s the point of being alive and healthy if you don’t get to experience the joy of life? ### Here’s the thing promiscuous or not- there’s other ways to contract herpes. my ex had cold sores and never told me, he went down on me and now I have GHSV1 and he dumped me after I contracted it because of my past… even though I did not have it before and claimed he didn’t think he needed to tell me and assumed everyone has it. Well now I deal with the stigma and he gets to live his life. ### Explain ### I don't think it's too difficult to find someone who hasn't hooked up a ton. There are plenty who still have a more traditional view of sex and intimacy, I just didn't care at the time I was exposed. When you're a young guy, you're glad to get sex wherever you can get it.

I only live once, and I got myself an incurable virus at the age of 20 that'll be with my until the day I die, and that sucks. Covid is gone in two weeks, herpes stays forever. Me being young and just caring didn't turn out positively. ### I contracted herpes the same way. I have HSV1 on my genitals. I was 16 with my first sexual partner. We had been dating for 3 years. He cheated and contracted cold sores, he went down on me. He refused to acknowledge he gave it me and I still can’t forgive him for what he did. I hate him. He gets to live his life without acknowledging what he did and with no repercussions ### That sucks, but I mean that's still contracting it sexually ### I'll explain. 

>Would you say that contracting hsv2 was a price worth paying for having an active sex life with multiple partners? 

Herpes isn't a punishment for being sexually active. It's not a ""price you pay"" for anything. Illnesses are not karmic justice, and this statement implies that she might not have herpes had she not had so many partners.

>I think you are bound to have herpes if you have sex with multiple partners throughout your life even if you use condoms.

Not really. Some of it is luck of the draw, some of it is asking for test results, etc. Condoms also offer significant protection against herpes. 

I was promiscuous in my younger years. I got herpes in a long term, serious relationship in my 30s. I knew he had it, and took the risk. I didn't get it when I was having multiple sex partners and not using condoms a lot because I was on the pill. 

Some of our members got herpes the first time they had sex, from an assault, or because they've had a varied sex life. 

You might not think you are shaming anyone, but your opinions are coming through loud and clear. ### Covid is not really gone in 2 weeks. There are health effects from the antibodies developed from it that we haven’t studied enough because it’s all so new but that’s another subject.

Well the statistics are that about 1 in 6 people have hsv2. And that’s the people that presumably have been diagnosed with it and that about 80% of people have it but don’t know. So that means the number must be much higher and it skews toward the older population who have had more sexual partners. Therefore say you are 30. And suppose we assume that the real prevalence of the disease is 1 in 6. If you’ve had sexual encounters with 6 different people, there’s a very high chance you’ve been exposed to it. The chance is still fairly high with even only 1 person around age 30. ### But that’s also saying any sexual contact is synonymous with promiscuity? And it’s not? some people get it their first time, some people dodge it completely and never get it. I have friends who live much more full sexually adventurous lives and are doing just fine. I wouldn’t say anyone who is sexually adventurous would get it and if u stay selective and conservative you’re less likely to get it- all it takes it one positive partner. ### This! This is the crux of the reason why slut shaming and stigma has no place in discussing a vial infection! It's a virus, not a personality flaw! ### I think you are projecting your personal beliefs onto me. Describing catching an incurable disease as a price worth paying for taking a specific risk is just a manner of speech that does not convey any moral judgement. It simply means what it says that catching the disease was taking a loss or paying a price. In this case the loss is having an incurable disease for life. I work in finance and I have to measure everything as a risk/reward trade off. You pay a price to take a bet with positive expected value. 

I could’ve asked if she thought having multiple sexual partners was a positive expected value trade given the risk of herpes but I think she would’ve been much more confused.

“Some of it is luck of the draw”

True that’s due to variance. You could just be very unlucky and catch herpes on your first sexual encounter or the opposite, never catch herpes. I don’t disagree with that. But I’m referring to the statistical certainty you’ll acquire herpes the more sexual partners you have due to the prevalence of the disease among the general population. If 1 in 6 people have herpes then assuming you’ve had more than six different sexual partners then there’s a very high probability you’ve already been exposed to it. The higher the number of sexual partners the more that probability approaches 1, which means an statistical certainty. ### No, covid isn't always gone in 2 weeks - long covid here. 

So do you have herpes, or are you trying to not get it? ### But that's why people need to be careful with what partners they're with and knowing their status before being intimate. Im not saying any sexual contact is promiscuity, I'm saying the reason this stuff is so common is because of an increased casual hookup environment. ### >It's a virus, not a personality flaw!

This, exactly. Herpes doesn't know, or care, or have the ability to determine if you've had one partner, 50, or 100, or more. It doesn't know, or care, or have the ability to determine if you help little old ladies across the street after church or with their groceries, or if you have cheated on a partner or did drugs. 

It just does it's biological thing, and like other viruses, reproduces and spreads. 

It's not karma or God's punishment or fate or whatever. It's science. ### >I work in finance and I have to measure everything as a risk/reward trade off. You pay a price to take a bet with positive expected value.

You say that you think I'm projecting my personal beliefs onto you. I'm projecting science, but aren't you doing the same thing you think I'm doing? If you are measuring everything as a risk/reward trade off, aren't you projecting your beliefs onto her? 

You could ask me that question, too, and it's interesting that you haven't, given that I got it in a serious relationship with a man I knew had herpes, but you ask it of someone you know had multiple partners. That's why I think you might be slut shaming. 

My risk/reward trade off paid off. Yes, I got herpes, but even though the relationship didn't work, I got other things out of the relationship that I'll value forever. 

Your formula is off, because you aren't factoring in things like condoms, transmission rates, antivirals, etc. Did you know that if a male is in a relationship with a female who has hsv2, and all they do is avoid sex during an outbreak, there is a 4% chance of transmission per year? Not a statistical certainty. 

You can't use the same formulas on human interaction that you might use when looking to buy a car, a house, stocks, etc., or whatever area of finance you work in. ### I don’t know if I have herpes. It’s just something that came into my mind from thinking about an unprotected sexual experience I had with a woman recently. Last time I tested myself for herpes was 2 years ago through a blood test and it came back negative. But then again those tests are unreliable. Didn’t have sex this whole time until this last sexual encounter and it was unprotected sex. The woman wants to keep having unprotected sex but I’m hesitant about it due to the prevalence of the disease. Hence I’m wondering about the risks and if I’m just being overly paranoid. It was the first time I had unprotected sex in a decade. Had forgotten how good it felt. ### I’m not doing the same thing you are doing because I’m not projecting my morals on what she’s doing. I’m just trying to look at op’s situation from a risk/reward point of view to see if she thinks it was worth it. I never said her behavior was morally reprehensible. But you choose to see the words I’m using as claiming that her behavior is morally bad simply because I described one outcome as a cost. Which is a fair way to describe it since the op seems to prefer to not have herpes. Therefore seeing the passing of moral judgement in describing a herpes infection as a cost has more to do with your own moral opinions about casual sex than mine.

I didn’t ask you that question because well you are not the op and I was originally talking to the op lol. Our conversation is whether I am slut shaming op or not. Which I don’t think I am nor have intention to.

Ps: I don’t think engaging in consensual casual sex with multiple partners throughout life is a morally reprehensible behavior itself. It just carries certain health risks. It’s like saying not sleeping enough or not eating healthy. Neither are morally reprehensible behaviors but they carry risks for which some people the reward is worth the price they may pay. ### The blood tests aren't unreliable if you tested at 12 weeks or more, and it was an IgG type specific test. The hsv1 IgG test can miss 30% of infections, but if you haven't had any genital symptoms, and tested negative for type 2, you don't have it. 

Why don't you and she test together? Having unprotected sex with anyone without testing for all STDs is risky. 

You can't avoid everything because of fear, but you don't have to sit in fear if you just test. ### I did test more than 12 weeks since last time I had sex with someone. Honestly after hearing so many descriptions of herpes infections on men. I do wonder if I’ve had those same outbreaks years ago and dismissed them as a pimple simply because I had always used a condom therefore thought I was safe from herpes.

Test together? Lol no that’s not going to happen. It’s a complicated situation. I think I’ll just try to avoid her and maybe get a regular girl with whom I can do that just to be less susceptible to her seduction. ### ",9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/thbvk8/newly_diagnosed_hsv2/

In the beginning I kind of accepted it.  
I found solace through helping others & learning as much as possible. But right now I feel like all my work has been halted. 

i just can’t help but feel depressed most days. I feel angry that this happened to me, I feel pissed that a skin rash is going to forever fuck up my love life. I’m so sad and touch starved, I feel disgusting all of the time. 

Every tingle, every strange feeling, i worry that I’m shedding. I’m on meds, changing my diet, but I never know what’s truly going on in my body at all times and it makes me feel so out of control. 

Whenever I post a picture I know I look good, but I can’t help but feel none of that matters because If people knew I have herpes, they wouldn’t care about my looks. It honestly sucks having this and being black. We’re already constantly judging each other for what we do and don’t bring to the table, now I have to get judged for this. This shit is debilitating. I don’t wanna get out of bed at all most days. 

I want to drop out of college because I hate it, but I also feel as though I have to have something to add some sort of value to me because herpes brings It down so much.

I’m dealing with the depression side as well and just really trying to accept it, but it’s hard. Every time I think I have and that it’ll be okay, I fall back into a deeper hole. Please know you’re not alone and your hsv status does NOT define you. You post those pics, you’re still perfect regardless of your skin condition. That’s exactly what it is… A SKIN CONDITION. Which has a terrible stigma. Truth is, more people probably have it than you know! It’s so common. You’re not disgusting, you’re not unloved, you’re not any of that.

Sucks ass. ### I’m 26 and it sucks 😥 I feel the same way about my work I used to love it now I hate going there. ### I'm older, but have lived a long time with this virus. 

It isn't going to ruin anything unless you let it. I promise.

If you are feeling depressed, feel like dropping out of school (omg, please don't do that if herpes has any factor in this decision - maybe change your major or something?), like you can't go on, then get counseling. I get that your generation looks to your peers for help, but when you are struggling this much, it's time for actual professional help. 

Herpes doesn't bring your value down (and I don't know who gave your generation this whole value as a person crap, but I hate it so much), because you just have value. You aren't worth more because you don't have herpes, or because you have accomplished such and such, or whatever. (I feel like my generation failed you somewhere, and I'm sorry.) 

You can still have whatever it is you want in life. It has been the smallest blip in my life. I got it in my 30s, and I swear to you, it doesn't even work to repel the drunk guys in bars that you don't want near you. Half of them have it too, and the other half don't care. 

My experience, of course, isn't the same as yours because I was older when I got it, but a good friend of mine got it when we were in high school, our junior year. We ended up at the same college, and she dated, found her guy, got married, and has kids. 

Other people I've met since - and there are many - that have herpes, all have really ""normal"" lives. They get married, and divorced, have gone to college, or not, had kids if they wanted to, etc etc. It's all just the same as everyone else. 

Herpes doesn't have to have a depression aspect. If it does, get help for that. Depression is it's own issue, and you should treat it that way. 

You all are still so worthy. 💖 ### 23 black female here an I agree, it sucks. ### 30 year old black female.

thjlh4,The stigma of GHSV The stigma of the hsv virus comes from the thought of people doing a certain type of job or having a certain type of lifestyle as most of people say…. Is this true?,8,2022-03-18 20:44:01-04:00,"Do you mean sex work when you say ""certain type of job""? And do you mean sexually promiscuous when you say ""certain type of lifestyle""? 

I mean, I don't know that anyone has ever thought I was a sex worker when I said I had herpes, but I'm sure some people automatically think people have had a lot of sex partners. I laugh, because I got it in my 30s, in a long term serious relationship, long after my wilder, more promiscuous days were over. 

Some people just think sex is ""dirty"" and having any sex outside marriage means you set yourself up for an STI. 

Maybe if you elaborate on what you mean, and why you are asking, we can help more. ### Sorry maybe I wrote too much ### I found out via searching for a cure on internet and by having seen some comments on Reddit that people who are hsv positive have the type of life that you mentioned, yes and are into drugs. I’m desperate this herpes has caused so many problems in my health physical and mental that I don’t see the point of continuing living like this, I never had the chance to have a complete good relationship and have caught this virus in a long term relationship but with someone who was not serious about our relationship and who treated me really badly but I couldn’t react as I was always ill. 
I feel like I lost everything. I couldn’t finish high school since I had a difficult situation in my teens, my brothers passed away one after the other and I guess that I needed physiological help, I couldn’t study so I left school and went to work. I build up 20 years of career in tourism and in the hotel industry and I was successful until I met this man who I thought was maybe a good person to get married with. Long story short the relationship hardly lasted 3 and a half years with many difficulties all to damage my person, I lost my job and had to leave the country were I lived for 27 years to go back to my original country where is super difficult to integrate and find a job and in any case I always wanted to finish school so I went back to school I passed the 3rd year and now I’m at my 4th and I have exams soon but I can’t concentrate I’m in a terrible state of mind I had a huge OB 2 days ago and I’m tired, tired of all of this agony, tired of having to hide from people because I know that they would just walk away from me for having this horrible virus.. I’m so lost, if it wasn’t for my parents I don’t know what I’d do but this isn’t life, maybe the only thing that it’s keeping me a part from my parents it’s the fact that I’m Catholic and I don’t want to go to hell but I’d want to end up in peace with my relatives (I know that this might sound stupid or childish to some people). This man destroyed my health at the age of 35 and now I’m 42 (not all people at the age of 42 are mature like you may think I should be as been this age, I lived in a Muslim country and the mentality is very different than the one of people who lived in Europe or USA even if I not an Arab. The last 3 years have been very hard mentally wise but also physically as this virus gave me so many problems…. ### Okay, so first, I'm sorry you have to go through all this, but people with herpes are just like everyone else - some have a lot of partners, some are into drugs, some have never touched drugs, or had alcohol. Some are very religious, some aren't. 

They are people who got a virus. The mode of transmission is sex. 

We have everyone in this forum from students to people with advanced degrees, from people who work at restaurants to corporate executives and technology experts and every single thing in between. Some are single, some are in relationships, some are married. Some have kids, some don't. Some are wealthy, probably, some aren't, probably. I think I've seen just about every race, religion, ethnicity, creed, several nationalities, gender identity, sexuality. 

Some people got herpes from their very first sexual experience. Some got it from being assaulted or abused. 

Don't let the stigma get to you - none of it is true. 

What you can do now is absolutely take care of you. Finish your schooling. Get some counseling. Anytime you wonder if it's worth it, it's time for counseling. You aren't the only person in your country with herpes - every country has it. See if you can get on suppression, like daily Valtrex. 

For your outbreak pain, get something with lidocaine in it, or lidocaine ointment. I don't know what's in your country, but ask a doctor. 

You have given men so much of you - don't let them have any more. Start living for you. I'm older than you are and know that some men at 42 - and 52 - aren't fully mature. Don't worry about that. Just work on you. You had a great career for a long time, and have experienced different parts of the world - you know you can be successful. You know you are smart. You can be successful now, and again. 

Once you heal from the past, then worry about the future, but for now, do YOU. Herpes is just one little itty bitty part of you. Don't let it be more than that. :) You are still wonderful. ### Your responses are so thoughtful, hopeful and everything I needed to read!

I wished there was (as gross as it may seem to some) because I was so lost and was trying to see what it could be.

th9i8j,"How to talk to partner about my HSV So I (23NB) have GHSV2 courtesy of some asshole taking off protection without telling me. It hasn’t been a huge deal until now.

I know he has every right to make that choice and prioritize his health, it’s just really frustrating. I don’t want to seem like I’m pressuring him, but I want to talk to him about how we can do things safely. I’m willing to go on daily antivirals, but I don’t think I can continue a relationship with a person who won’t have sex with me.

You're describing an action, not asking a question or opinion.  I may or may not be cracking a joke, however, I am describing what comes to mind with your depiction. 

""I cannot maintain an erection"" - that is a mockery. I would assume you'd be having anxiety attacks if you weren't thinking about sexual thoughts. The mere fact that you're getting aroused and flopping isn't a sign of someone worrying. Also, I don't think herpes would give you this side effect. If it was an ob on your pee hole you'd be crying-from what I've read at least. ### i think you need to do another test and the doctor can only tell you best! ### There are many studies linking herpes and ED. 

I’ve never had this issue before even when extremely anxious. And all of a sudden when I feel a pop in my urethra. I can’t get one?  It seems odd. 

I understand I’m not trying to be rude. The reason why I jumped to the conclusion of herpes is because I’ve been experiencing symptoms of it for weeks. And I cannot find any other possible thing that would pop within my urethra. No mention of cysts in men or anything else on or in the urethra.  The only thing potential thing is herpes. ### I agree on the testing. I just don’t think the doctor has been helpful at all. They really seem clueless. ### Relax. Take a deep breath. You're not being rude but you are making a mistake by self diagnosing yourself. This could be other stuff. The erection part is more than likely your nerves. Cyst is not herpes, especially painless. You tested at 5 weeks. Great baseline. Do not take my word for it but I'd say you have a good chance of being negative at 12 weeks. Not everyone develops antibodies that quick, but also not everyone develops antibodies after 12 weeks either. Trying to give you peace of mind here because you probably don't have herps, but you most certainly need to go get tested rather than describe your symptoms here. ### ""I've been experiencing symptoms of it for weeks""

That is not typical of herpes. Most symptoms would not last that long.

Equally a cyst in the urethra does not sound like herpes, neither does erectile dysfunction. 

Stop diagnosing yourself and go and see a professional. If you have burst something in your urethra go and tell a professional and get a swab of your urethra immediately.

th0x8p,"Diagnosed with genital HSV-1 So I just got my results back, it’s genital HSV-1. I have no idea how this is different from HSV-2, can anyone educate me on this matter? I would appreciate it a lot! (Male 21)",41,2022-03-18 09:07:29-04:00,"It's the same virus, you are still contagious and you still have this for life, you should still disclose to partners and you should still take precautions when having sex to limit the risk of transmission. But there are some big differences. I am unsure why so many comments here are saying there is not much difference - there is.

Hsv1 does not like to live on the genitals. Outbreaks are less severe and studies have shown that shedding is far less frequent than genital hsv2 or oral hsv1. If you are not shedding the virus, and the virus is not present on the skin, you are at no risk of transmitting the virus. Which means having a strain in a location in which it sheds the least, is advantageous if you are concerned with reducing transmission risk.

For you, this means you have the ""preferable"" kind of hsv - the one that is least likely to transmit to partners. Terri Warren an expert at Westover Heights Clinic has over 35 years of experience with herpes and has never seen someone transmited genital hsv1 from the genitals of someone else. This means that genital hsv1 is almost exclusively caused by the carrier of oral hsv1 performing oral sex on them. Oral hsv 2, which is quite rare, sheds even less at 1% of the days evaluated.

One study found that after 2 years of infection with genital hsv1, the rates of asymptomatic/symptomatic shedding dropped massively. In another study, genital hsv1 shedded on 3-5% of the days evaluated, versus 15-30% for genital hsv2. Thats a pretty massive difference. 

We know that for hsv2, if you take daily valtrex you can cut this shedding down even further, by about 50%. And if you then use condoms ontop of this every time you have sex, your liklihood of transmission is extremely low. Keep in mind that these stats are based on hsv2, not hsv1, and since genital hsv1 is known to shed less, these numbers are probably even more favourable in the case of genital hsv1.

Once your immune system gets used to this virus, people with hsv1 genitally typically have far less outbreaks and they tend to be far less severe, though early infection can still be rough.

All this information is available via the free downloadable ""Herpes Handbook"" from the Westover Heights Clinic.

Even though you are statistically less likely to spread the virus, please consider the importance of disclosure. At the end of the day, herpes is herpes. ### HSV1 is typically in the mouth (coldsores/crankers) and HSV2 is typically in the genital area (STI). It not uncommon for HSV1 to be found on the gential or vise versa.

This most likely means that whoever gave you genital HSV1 had a coldsore and gave you head. My doctor said that is you have HSV1 in the genital area its less serve as having HSV2 in the genital area. 

""The herpes simplex virus (HSV) is categorized into 2 types: HSV-1 and HSV-2. HSV-1 is mainly transmitted by oral-to-oral contact, causing oral herpes (including symptoms known as cold sores), but it can also lead to genital herpes. HSV-2 is a sexually transmitted infection that causes genital herpes"" Google ### Welcome to the club. I was diagnosed with this same thing a few years back. Everybody’s different, I’m sure… but I figured out relatively early what caused my (only 2) outbreaks and have had no issues since. I’ve disclosed to all previous partners and even had unprotected sex with those that I was close with. So far, so good… haven’t spread it to anyone. Please be careful regardless and know that it’s not the end of the world. You got this 💪🏻 ### [removed] ### Did they swab to test? ### One is upstairs and the down stairs any below is tpye two ### Thanks for this comment! This is really helpful and clears it all up for me. ### Both of these can be sexually transmitted and you’re making it seem like they can’t and somewhat demonizing hsv2 ### I still don’t understand if genital HSV1 is any different from genital HSV2. ### Cranker?? ### What caused them? ### Comment removed due to misinformation. It is very well established that ghsv1 is *far* less contagious than both genital hsv2 and oral hsv1.

Studies haven't been conducted on actual transmission rates. But this can already be inferred by comparing asymptomatic shedding rates, which *are* known for all four type & location combinations, as well as the experiences of herpes experts and other STD experts who have worked in the field treating patients for multiple decades and say things such as:

>...I would make is that genital to genital HSV1 transmission not only is ""somewhat"" uncommon. It appears to be very rare. In my 40+ years in the STD business, I have never seen a patient with newly acquired genital HSV1 who apparently acquired it by genital intercourse, only by receiving oral sex...

(Source: STD Expert H. Hunter Handsfield addressing Question #1238: ""HSV1 Genital-Transmission and Disclosure"" on the [AskExpertsNow](https://www.askexpertsnow.com/) forum of the [American Sexual Health Association](https://www.ashasexualhealth.org/))

And here's a quote from STD expert Edward W Hook on the same forum:

>Genital HSV-1 is transmitted from infected partners far less often than genital HSV-2.  This is no doubt the result of several contributors including that clinical recurrences are less common with genital HSV-1 than for genital HSV-2 and because when people have genital HSV-1 they experience only about 20-25% of the amount of asymptomatic shedding of the virus that persons with genital HSV-2 do.  There are no recommendations on the potential benefit of chronic suppressive therapy for genital HSV-1, in part because the transmission is so uncommon that it is simply not a practical thing to study.  Does that mean that sexual transmission of GHSV-1 does not occur- of course not but it is quite uncommon.

Also note that more recent research has determined that genital hsv1 shedding frequency is actually even *less* than that stated above.

And here's a quote from herpes expert Terri Warren regarding genital-to-genital hsv1 transmission:

>the likelihood that you would infect someone through intercourse is incredibly low. 

([Source](https://westoverheights.com/forum/question/i-want-to-understand-more-about-ghsv-1/))

And another quote from Terri:

>We actually have some great new information about genital HSV 1 infection based on a paper presented by Dr. Christine Johnson at the University of Washington, this past July.  Once a person has had genital HSV 1 for two years, based on her study, they only shed virus on 4 days out of an entire year.  That's why transmission through intercourse is so rare.  Now some people may shed virus more often and certainly some shed less, and there is more shedding quite early in the infection.  But that's the average after two years and as you can see it is very low indeed.  Based on her paper, I would say shedding at one year is probably around 4-5% of days, so 4-5 days out of 100 days, as an estimate.

(Source: Question #6376: ""To Dr. Handsfield"" on the [AskExpertsNow](https://www.askexpertsnow.com/) forum of the [American Sexual Health Association](https://www.ashasexualhealth.org/)).

And in regard to the ghsv1 shedding frequency stated above, keep in mind that the vast majority of exposures to asymptomatic shedding do *not* result in transmission. Asymptomatic shedding makes transmission *possible* but it certainly *doesn't* guarantee it. Far more often than not, exposure to asymptomatic shedding *doesn't* result in transmission. So by 2 years in, there are only 4 days on average, per year, when there would be any risk at all, and even on those days the risk would still be low. ### it was a swab during my outbreak ### huh i’ve got 1 downstairs tho 😂 ### I was just wondering if type 1 is any different when it comes to outbreaks/transmission, since i’ve read a lot of info saying that it’s generally less infective and less aggressive. ### Not my intention at all. I agree both can be sexual transmitted I never said otherwise, giving someone oral is still a sexual act.. if the person they were with had hsv1 in the genital areas that’s also another way they could have gotten it, 

I never said anything bad against hsv2. I said having hsv1 in the genital area may mean you have less serve symptoms according to my doctor but not every doctor is 100% right. ### Don’t think so much about the location but the type of virus. 

Think of it as two types of viruses because essentially they are two different viruses from the same family. ### they’re just two different strands of the same virus. think delta and omicron except not exactly (experts don’t come at me pls) but they’re not rlly different from one another. the main difference is that hsv1 thrives in the oral region so to have GHSV1 means you will probably not experience as many outbreaks as someone with GHSV2 (although this may not be true for everyone with ghsv2 cause every body reacts differently). hope this helps! ### 67% of people have oral herpes, so the percentage of people to have genital herpes is higher than 11% of HSV2. Pretty everyone is having oral sex. ### Most people are already positive for hsv1. Have partners test BEFORE you tell them. I test negative for hsv1 , and everytine the doctor/nurse seems surprised because I'm almost 30 . Supposedly by age 50, 85-90% of people have hsv1 ### I used to shave down there with a bic razor blade. And when I nicked myself I had my first outbreak. Then it happened again maybe a few months later so I stopped shaving like that started trimming instead. ### Thanks! Trying to educate myself because my doctor won’t. ### From what I’ve read ghsv1 is less severe in its frequency and intensity of outbreaks. You can look up @pickeringfitness on tiktok. He has ghsv1 and is helping to break the stigma surrounding herpes and has some informative vids ### I have it and yes agree lower transmission rate and fewer/possibly less aggressive outbreaks in the future but as to reactions and outbreaks happening it’s still similar and you still have viral shedding which is asymptomatic shedding so you could never pass it on or pass it on your first time it’s a crapshoot. 

Also more likely if someone goes down on you for them to get it orally. ### My doctor once told me if the sores on the genital area (ghsv2) was exposed to air the same way cold sores (ghsv1) were on the lip, the two strains would be identical and unable to tell the difference. ### Thanks for ur fast replies :). I get that they’re different viruses but is it also different from each other when it comes to outbreaks, transmission, etc. ### Wow that’s too bad im a girl can trim but not really lol. It keeps starting a little when I shave too so annoying but I too have never spread it yet to anyone ( thank god) that I know of! ### hahah im not the right person for education, but i apparently a swab during outbreak gives the most credible result with 100% accuracy ### @pickeringfitness actually has GHSV2! He uses GHSV1 in a lot of examples to show how stupid the stigma is when it comes to herpes and the double standard :) ### Hmm don’t know about that, my doctor says that a swab test is 100% accurate if it’s during an outbreak ### It’s harder to answer, your best bet is to do your own research because I don’t want to give any false information.

As I mentioned, my doc said that because HsV1 is typically in the mouth it doesn’t “live” very well in the genital area so they outbreaks are less common and less painful than say hsv2. 

In terms of transmission, if I remember correctly they spread about the same, more likely if you’re having an outbreak but the chances are slim when you don’t have one. The rates also go down the longer you have it, so the first year you’re most likely to shed it ### Haha it’s all good, I think the look is making a comeback anyways lol. Glad to hear you haven’t spread it either ### For sure for sure. They just told me they wouldn’t  test where you have 1 or 2 (oral or genital) unless there’s an outbreak. But they didn’t explain it was because they needed a culture. It’s a simple thing to explain and maybe common sense. But it didn’t occur to me and I had to dig for answers to find out. ### Oh okay, I could have sworn that he has ghsv1! Suzbub on tiktok is another good one, she has ghsv2 ### Ah okay, i’ll try but I can’t really find any significant info about GHSV1 since it’s mainly in the lip area.. ### I lol’d thanks hahaha yeah people I’ve been with don’t seem to care I just let it go for a bit and then shave it but maybe waxing will help :/ if I was a guy like you I’d just trim…….  But I wash like a crazy person I feel like you need to if you’re rocking little fur down there. Anyway, thanks and good luck to you with yours, slay on🍆🥚 ### Yesss I absolutely love her!! She’s defo my fav ### GHSV1 typically gives less frequent OBs. It also sheds less frequently so the risk of transmission is lower. Overall, the OBs will look exactly HSV2, the main difference is just how the virus behaves. Since HSV1 prefers the mouth, it’s not as aggressive on the genitals. ### Mine too!

Can someone get symptoms on face and genitals both in herpes?",8,2022-03-18 19:27:41-04:00,"Sounds like anxiety and like you're describing Fordyce, nonetheless, get tested ### Yes you are right. This way I will die by panic rather than actually having any serious issue ### Recently got tested for HIV 1/2 & Hepatitis b & c virus. Report came negative.

It has been 2 weeks since I had intercourse with this women and I have not felt any serious symptoms. No swelling nod lymph nodes, no body pain, no ulcer, no pain, no fever, no headache and no visible thing on my genitals except that very small fordyce.

I will go for HSV test soon as there is no test for hpv for men I will go for usual consulting.


Yes I have been very anxious since I came back after the intercourse. This much that I don't get sleep easily in the night. ### Did you have unprotected sex?

I don't know why people get tested for hep C. It's so very rarely transmitted sexually, and if it is, it's unprotected anal sex. 

See a doctor. Let them tell you what it is. 

Also, if you had unprotected sex, test for gonorrhea, chlamydia and syphilis. Those are far more common than HIV, and any of the heps. ### Yes I had Unprotected sex. I have not seen any serious symptoms till now ( 2 weeks). No sore, nothing on my penis except very few fordyce spots. 

I am checking everyday and there is no increase in size of these tiny fordyce spots. ### Fordyce spots probably won't change in size. They were probably there before but now you are anxious and checking every little thing and just noticed them. 

They are normal and common. 

Limit your checks to once a day. If you get a discharge, you'll notice it on your underwear without checking. You won't need a magnifier or anything. If you get a sore, you won't need a magnifier or special lighting to see it. If you check more than once a day, you might cause irritation, which will cause more anxiety. ### Thanks for sharing this info. 

I am assuming if I was positive then it must have turned into sore by now or any other symptom must have appeared. 

I trimmed hairs around my gentile to monitor everyday ### Okay - just to clarify - Fordyce spots won't turn into anything. They will remain Fordyce spots. They are oil glands, and are sometimes more noticeable than others. Everyone has them - men and women. You have them on your lips, too. 

You are overthinking this. You don't need to monitor this closely. 

Herpes sores appear usually between 2-12 days, on average. Genital warts can take months. A syphilis sore can appear between 10-90 days, the average is 3 weeks, and usually between 3 and 6 weeks. 

Really, just don't panic, and go get tested. Test for syphilis at 6 weeks. That's less common than gonorrhea and chlamydia, so no need to rush out for that. 

Just breathe, and go do something fun this weekend and stop worrying. ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/thi41u/is_this_herpes_or_hpv/

Thank you! 🤗",8,2022-03-18 11:42:19-04:00,">I have GHsv2, and I want to buy some suppliments to give a boost to my immune system 

There are no supplements known to boost the immune system in any manner that has any impact on herpes. 

If a person has highly abnormal immune function, to the point where it's functioning is so below average that it would be considered a medical issue, then *that* could make a difference. But for a person who already has normal immune function, there is no reliable evidence that any supplements have any impact on herpes activity. That incudes lysine. ### r/HerpesCureResearch has a topic going on right now about a study using gluatmine. I am taking 500mg a day to test it out ### Turkey Tail mushroom, B complex, Monolaurin, Olive Leaf, Lysine, Tulsi (Holy Basil), Licorice root, MSM, Iron 

You don’t have to take all of these of course, I’m just really into supplements lol. And of course consult with your dr first! ### I take lysine, B 100 complex and D. I also make sure to consume lots of C from fruits. ### You’re awesome I was just thinking what can I take. I’m curious, how often do you have breakouts. Also female or male?

Also, to get a good accurate swab you need to swab to the bumps within 24-48 hours. 

The iGG numbers you mention are positive but it’s super low which could be a false positive. Best bet is to get the western blot test. ### Oh how I wish thats what was on my screen.. 😩 ### you’re negative ### I don’t think this means you don’t have it/anymore… it just means according to the swab what’s happening now/whatever was swabbed is not an outbreak related to the herpes virus. 

But also the HSV 2 marker says positive in your blood.  If anything says positive I wouldn’t be so sure as to assume you don’t have it. Go to your primary care doctor or whoever requested the testing and have them discuss it with you. ### You're so lucky 😭 ### IgG tests are notoriously inaccurate. Even after 12 weeks, 30% of hsv1 is missed and 3% of hsv2. Meaning you can get a false negative result. On the other hand false positive results are also incredibly common, with a low postive IgG score of 1.1-3.5 carrying a 50% chance of being false positive! The lower the score, the more likely its a false positive.

If you have herpes symptoms then these should not be ignored. A swab is very accurate but only if done in good time. An outbreak like you have described is unlikely to last a month or more - it can happen with severe outbreaks but typically most outbreaks will have cleared up by then. Waiting a month to swab would bring back an untrustworthy result, since swabbing should be done ASAP.

Have you been to an sti clinic and discussed your symptoms with a professional? ### I got tested like 4 times and it was always negative the first time it was during a OB simply put you most likely still have it even if your test is saying you're negative. ### With the confirmatory test being negative, do you think it’s good to just consider im negative at this point? ### Not necessarily.

I strongly encourage you not to believe this diagnosis quite yet. The supplemental test from LabCorp and I'm assuming that's where it's from, has many false positives.

Unfortunately, the supplemental test is not the best confirmatory test but the herpes western blot is. Also, the IGN test should never have been done. The Center for disease control says never to use it and Quest Diagnostics is taking it off of their list of tests that one can choose.

I'm now more confused than ever.

This really freaking sucks!


ORIGINAL:
I've always had ghsv1 (don't know how I got it).
My dr just called me that I have both hsv1 and hsv2 (I didn't ask him to test for it - went for routine gyn exam and wanted routine std screening).

I'm so irritated by this because even though I've had hsv1 for many years (I'm in my 30s) i now have hsv2 and have no idea how I got it.

I was just getting comfortable with ghsv1 (have a new partner and he's fine with it) but now I have to tell him this as well?!!!

And I don't even know if the hsv is genital or oral.

So frustrated!!!!

I hate this so much!!!!


Edit: Just looked at my labwork and my IgM is positive. Does that mean its a recent infection?",5,2022-03-18 12:02:20-04:00,"IGm does indicate recent infections I believe. So possibly got it from him. Have him test if he has antibodies it’s possible it’s from him. 

Are you sure you’ve always had ghsv1 not oral hsv1? If you’ve had genital hsv1 as a child, im sure it would raise concern in your doctors because this could indicate sexual abuse? ### Thanks for the response. 
Yes its genital hsv 1. Was diagnosed after a bad outbreak.
I'm 99% sure there was no abuse as a child. My outbreaks as a kid (maybe 10 years old) were always dismissed as ""oh you probably have thrush, not washing that area well"" it was never looked at. Not blaming anyone - wasn't born in this country.
I know a close family member that had herpetic whitlow on a finger so it's likely from that. ### Yes but that would require for that person to apply their fingers to your genitals. If you say there’s no abuse, okay. But this is a really strange case…I’ve never heard of genital herpes occurring without sexual contact. The only thing I can think of is that they were changing your diapers at one point and that could have resulted in it, but I think if you were in diapers at the time the herpes would have been more serious. 


Has anybody else experienced something like this? 

Either way, OP, we’re going to be okay. I’m frustrated too. Pissed off that I have to live like this, jealous of everyone that doesn’t. Just be open with your partner and hopefully since they were okay with the original genital herpes, they’ll be okay with another one lol. ### ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/th4q6a/just_told_i_have_hsv_2_ive_had_ghsv1_since_i_was/

Positive for hsv 1 with 4 different scores so far: 22.5, 22.8, 24 and 20.5 over 4 different test.

th92k8,"Lost at this point. Hello All,

I’ll get straight to it. Had unprotected sex and literally felt the need to frequently urinate hours later. I freaked out and took orals for chlamydia and gonorrhea. I’m 6 days from initial the day of unprotected sex and have felt the “tingles” throughout this time. Had a brief headache around day 4. I also started the oral for UTI on day 3. Have been out of it but I think that is more in line with my mental being out of whack from bad nerves. I have not a single bump or open sore. Still have a light tingle… I can tell something is off. Also experiencing tingles in my feet as of these last couple days. Could be linked to the antiviral medicine from what I’ve read. 

What is it that could cause me to have that frequent urination literally hours later?… the tingles… how long before I consider myself in the clear for herpes? 

I still feel a bit off down there, still peeing a bit often… but no bumps, no flu like symptoms really… 

What’s the likelihood of not having bumps after tingling for so many days and it being herpes? 

Thank you all in advance and have a blessed day.",6,2022-03-18 13:48:52-04:00,"The frequent peeing must be something else. But, I feel you bro. I had weird tingling & itchiness for weeks. Got tested & came out positive for HSV1. Till this day, I haven’t gotten a sore or a bump, after almost a year of me being confirmed with it. If I were you looking please get tested. You might’ve maybe already had it before the hookup. ### Sounds like UTI from dirty fingers. It can take up to 3 months to test positive for HSV. I haven't had any symptoms and it came up on my regular exam. ### Hi there :) and I’ve been there before! I think the most important thing you can do is go and get tested. Be completely upfront with your symptoms to the doctor. Ask the doctor EXACTLY what they are testing you for. Idk if stds are just too taboo in society, but doctors/nurses have a tendency to be very vague. Sometimes they use lingo like “youre clean” or “your tests are negative”, but they don’t say what tests you were negative for. Another thing to keep in mind in incubation periods. Let’s say you have sex with someone who has chlamydia and doesn’t know they have it. You go to the STD clinic a couple days later because you feel anxious about it all. You could still have a negative result, because chlamydia takes 7-14 days (typically, it could take longer) to show up. I’d also be careful taking meds for chlamydia/gonorrhea if you didn’t get a positive test for either of them. Antibiotic resistance is real, so it’s important to only take meds if you have a confirmed diagnoses. Another thing to consider is most docs do not perform herpes testing unless you have a bump somewhere. You could also ask for a HSV blood test, buuuut that just shows if you’ve ever been exposed (and most people have), but it doesn’t confirm if you’re having a breakout- only a swab of an active bump can do that. Another thing to think about could be that the lesions are hidden. If you have a vagina, it could be on the inside of your vagina. Sometimes it can be on the inside of your anus. Frequent urination has been linked to chlamydia/gonorrhea. It could also be a UTI. I use to get utis a lot from having sex with an old partner. Another thing I will say is that I’ve been there. Sometimes when I would have sex with someone, after I’d be so paranoid that something is wrong down there. I’m at the point now where I just have to listen more to my body. Sometimes my mind makes symptoms seem worse than they actually are. Sometimes my mind makes symptoms up if I’m paranoid enough. There’s no harm in getting testing though if you truly feel symptoms. Get better:)) sending you good vibes ### Thanks for getting back to me. How long did the tingles last for you? ### Wow… thank you. Extremely grateful for your response. ### Like 5-7 days. It was more of a quick sharp tingly pain, but I never saw a bump or sore. Even tho, I haven’t had a sore on my lips or genitalia. I’m still diagnosed with HSV.

I am against medication in general , but if it was bad I’d take  acyclovir,but I’d feel so weird after taking it ,maybe because I don’t take them daily ,who knows ! 

My breakouts are induced by bad diet,lack of sleep,and when I’m very stressed out ! However, I didn’t want to take the meds, so I started trying different things,such as L-Lysine, trying to improving my diet ,creams,and so on . That helped ,but takes way longer to heal. 

So oneday I’m talking to my bf and she discloses and I so felt so relieved , I finally had someone close to can talk to ! She hasn’t taken Rx in years(8+). Her regime is : she waxes religiously ,she believes with hair there it’s harder to heal and traps in the outbreak 🤷🏾‍♀️,if she ever feels a tingle she soaks in hot water, with ACV and a little bit of baking soda, once she gets out her soak, she soaks a cotton ball with alcohol and basically holds the cotton ball on the sore(yes it burns) her thought process is to dry out the sore, then dabs a bit of tea tree oil on there and sleeps with no panties . Also, every-time she uses the bathroom, she cleans the area with a alcohol pad and drinks nothing but lemon water . Soooooo I’ve been trying her regime and it WORKS FOR ME ALSO. I wasn’t a big fan of waxing but since I’ve started with the additional stuff  I’ve been break out free for a few months !

Skeptical about it like I am with everything I try, I decided to give it a go 5 months ago and bought a 3 month supply to see if it would help.

I noticed halfway through month #2 that the lymph node on the left side of my groin was gone(no swelling), after discovering this I ordered another 3 month supply, they accidentally sent me 6 months lol, which I'll happily take. April 3 with will be 6 months on the program and I have had no outbreaks, no pain, no itching etc. Nothing, so I will say it's a success thus far, never went this long without an OB and I'm super happy my lympy node for the first time in 8 years isn't swollen. I would say give it a try, BUT you have to be consistent in taking it, don't miss a dose, you take two pills a day, one in morning one at night, hope this helps someone, as it has helped me thus far, it has a 60 day money back guarantee which is why I took a chance with it, glad I did ### What is ACV ### Oh, you can also mix a TINY bit of Manuka Honey with Organic Coconut Oil and apply to sores.

What part of the body: genital area
Symptoms: 3 painful purple flat bumbs.
What do they look like: their purple brownish (now 1 with a white sort of layer above it)
It started 2 days ago with one bumb it looked like a mole at first, now 3. Newest one on the inside of my virgina and it's white, the other 2 (1 huge one a bit smaller) purple, one with a white layer since this morning.

There is no liquid inside it. They are flat and very painful.
They do not itch or burn. It does not hurt to pee or poop.
They only hurt when something touches them.
Virginal discharge is a bit yellowish, milk like. 
I dont know how to describe the odor. It has a smell but not something that would make me puke?

How long has the symptoms been there: 2 days now. Started Wednesday with a slight painful feeling but I thought I has just accidentally scratched myself but then Wednesday evening there was the first bumb.

Have they changed at all since they appeared: yes they multiplied by 3 and they grew bigger, colour changed on one since this morning. A white kind of layer. (I applied pictured)

All came back negative and I found out from peoples in the  responses to my Reddit post that genital ulcers seem to appear in some people who get covid, so you might not have it. You should still get tested just to be sure ### I doubt you would have genital herpes if you're a virgin unless you have oral herpes and touched yourself. Even then,  if you have an established oral infection then it's unlikely to spread to other parts of your body. Only way to know for sure is to get the sores swabbed. ### If you've never had skin to skin genital contact with another person's genitals or mouth, it is SUPER unlikely to be herpes. Does your doctor know this? I can't imagine why they would think herpes without an exam and knowing your sexual history. The way they are perfectly round and scabbing makes me actually think ringworm actually, in which case you need an antifungal cream. ### Yes ### I was sexual assaulted about 10 years ago but can it be transmitted like 10 years ago by a finger? Cus if not than never. ### Thats actually a relieve to hear. I will get it tested thank you ### I will insist my docter to test for herpes and ringworm and everything else she can think of on monday (end of my quarantine). I got antibiotics but I dont think antibiotics works for a STD, does it? I'm supposed to see improvement within 24 hours but untill now it still hasn't improved. My docter said that you don't necessarily need to have contact with anyone, that you can get herpes randomly just like that. ### Yes unfortunately. The virus can lay dormant for any period of time. When your body then becomes infected with covid it can no longer keep the herpes suppressed and it brakes out ### Classic doctor move to prescribe antibiotics for no reason despite no laboratory confirmation of bacterial presence... If it was herpes, she would have needed to prescribe antivirals, as it's a viral infection rather than a bacterial infection. Some STDs are bacterial and treated by antibiotics, but herpes is not one of them. I'm doubting that she really thinks it's herpes since she prescribed antibiotics rather than antivirals. ### You can't just ""randomly"" get herpes. Your doctor is definitely misinformed. ### But I've been sick before this (after the SA) with a fever higher than 41 degree celcius/ 105,8 fahrenheit. And I've never had these bumbs before? This is all so confusing. Though thank you and the others for all your help so far. ### I knew it! I knew I wasn't crazy. ### https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34667693/

Trying to look for some information online but it’s all kind of the same…nothing I’m really finding about the differences between HSV1 or 2, if they’re significant or not, how to best handle it going forward. I guess I’m just wondering how people live with it, how it goes and all that. The doctor seemed pretty casual about it and acted like I don’t have anything to worry about. This is something that HAS to be disclosed to sexual partners right? Even when there’s no outbreaks?

I was tested at urgent care and will be following up w my actual doctor for more info as well.",20,2022-03-17 22:18:28-04:00,"I'm in the same boat as u, im 20 and just got diagnosed w/ G-HSV1 because I got oral from a girl who was asymtomatic. I saw two doctors for their opinions and they both said the following:

Basically if you're having a one night stand type situation, there isn't really a need to disclose G-HSV1, as the transmission/shed rates are extremely low and you can take an antiviral/use protection on top of that. Hsv-1 does not thrive in the genitals and it is much harder to transmit from that area than orally. Now if you're getting into a continued sexual relationship with someone, you should probably disclose it to them but again, it GHSV-1 transmission rates are EXTREMELY low. Again, this is what two doctors told me. ### Ok so I’ve had ghsv-1 for 9 years. So I’ll tell you about my experience. Ghsv-1 is known for having a lower genital to genital tranmission rate then ghsv-2 . Also anyone who has cold sores is immune to your herpes because 99% of all cold sores are hsv-1.  So with both types of herpes transmission rate is less from female to male and it is also much less if you do not have an outbreak basically with no outbreak GHSv-1 and being a female your transmission rate is around 1% if that. There isn’t much of a difference between the two other than that they look the same when having an outbreak. There is a running theory that people with GHSV one have less outbreaks and that was true for me overtime. I never was on any medication I never took any supplements and after around 2 to 3 years I stopped having outbreaks altogether. I went around five years with no outbreaks until I got Covid and then my streak was broken. I am a firm advocate for disclosing every time all the time if someone has a weak immune System herpes can affect them way worse than someone with a regular immune system and I’m also a huge advocate of informed consent and having a choice. I have disclosed over 25 times and had very minimal rejections and a lot of success. (I’ll attach a disclosure guide) and the dr was so nonchalant because 1 in 6 people ages 14-49 have genital herpes, 50-80% of the population has hsv-1 and 60% of new genital herpes cases are hsv-1 so you are very far from alone.

Please reach out if you need anything!! I promise it gets better! ### Let's hope I don't miss anything.

Usually, HSV-1 is oral, and HSV-2 is genital. However, it doesn't mean the one type can't cause an outbreak in the other area though.

Depending on your source, 2/3 of people have HSV 1 and/or 2.

Yes, it's something you can transmit even if there are no outbreaks. If you do have an outbreak, you can go see or potentially even call a doctor, and they'll prescribe you a (10 day for the first time, 2-4 days for subsequent times) dose of either Valacyclovir or Acyclovir. (They're both practically the same.)

Generally, people with HSV don't have a lot to worry about. We've all been where you are. You first find out, have to leave work because you're so distraught, or spend the next few days crying yourself to sleep because you're worried you'll never get anyone to like you again. You'll get better. You have to. Every single one of the people in this sub has sympathy for you, and the only thing we can do for now is help each other through it. 

However, there is a team of researchers working on a cure for herpes. they're making progress every day, and they're on track to have a completed cure within the next 4-5 years. keep an eye on the news and we'll eagerly await the cure together. ### 25F just diagnosed, too with HSV-1 on genitals. My friends a nurse who specializes in STI care, she sent me some good resources. If you wanna give me your email or some other way to send you documents, let me know. They were really helpful to me. I also found this handbook helpful. On page 15 and 16 it talks about shedding rates (with caveat that most people in study have been together long term already/ie long term exposure has already occurred). https://westoverheights.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Updated-Herpes-Book.pdf ### So you have oral hsv1 and genital hsv1? Was it swabbed to confirm type 1? ### I’m 23. I feel you. I feel weird being young and getting it like. Is this my life now? This is my life now. Wow. I don’t … i don’t know what to do. 23F ### this is so scary to hear cause even thought chances are super low there’s still a chance :/ i just wish there was a way to know when you are actively shedding. i’m way to scared to not disclose ### if you know you have a positive diagnosis, please please please disclose with people - EVEN IF ITS A ONE NIGHT STAND (that’s how i got mine - i asked and they told me they were clean and well now i’m here). even though the transmission rate can be low, it can still be given to someone. most people are asymptomatic but let’s worry about all the symptomatic individuals that went through pure torture with their OBs, especially vagina-having individuals. they are more prone to symptoms and issues with OBs. we all just need to take care of each other and normalize talking about STD testing and diagnosis.

all this to say - please don’t take away someone’s sexual health autonomy just because you want a quickie for one night. DISCLOSE! ### Thank you so much, your comment is super helpful. I’m wondering … I first was exposed and diagnosed around end of February 2021… my outbreak was terrible and I was sick with fever then cough then breakouts for 6 weeks. I thought I was in the clear after April when I didn’t have a break out again. Then a couple of days ago I started to feel itch and pain down there around same area. I started on meds again and it’s sort of under control but still painful. I don’t see sores yes but it feels like skin ripping and there’s a bump underneath skin. Is this another outbreak? Should I just expect them once a year? I want to cry I was doing well mentally hopefully I’d never have one again :((( I hope at most it’s once a year. It’s just so painful. I even am using a cream that helps numb it a bit but still uncomfortable :( ### I just got diagnosed today sadly. Is it normal my doctor prescribed it for the rest of my life? I have 11 refills before this time next year. Unsure and lost. A wreck of course. ### Completely feel u. I was so happy with my life and 3 weeks ago I went to urgent care and when the doctor said herpes i couldnt believe it. Asymptomatic girl have it to me thru oral head.. like wtaf... that is so unfair, but i guess it could be worse. For the past couple weeks its all I've thought about, almost 24/7, but i know itll get better. Its so common and apparently a cure/vax is right around the corner. i know plenty of people with it, its really not that bad. just know i am going thru exactly what u r and ur not alone, it will get better. dont worry and try not to stress:) ### i agree w u to an extent, just relaying what my docs told me. its a tough situation. did u get ghsv1 or ghsv2? ### No. Your dosage isn't normal as far as I know. Is it Acyclovir or Valcyclovir? Either way, don't tell your Dr. Just keep it in case you really need it. (Hell, the world may be thrust into a nuclear war and you may need a stockpile.) Some of us would be very happy to have some leftover. ### I know nobody except for this thread. trying to keep it together.

As for whether you take it every day, that's up to you. 

it's used to prevent outbreaks or lessen the intensity of ongoing outbreaks, so if you're okay with a higher chance of an outbreak in exchange for having some leftover in case you do have one, then hold on to some or all of them. It's really up to you. ### Everyone situation is different. Some go on daily suppressive if they’re pregnant, have many sex partners, or if their partner doesn’t have the same HSV strain.

I think one of the things that has been hard to come to terms with for me is trying to pin down how it happened and who gave it to me. It’s a VERRRY grey area. Typically it takes 2-20 days for an initial outbreak to occur, but sometimes it can take YEARS for one to occur. Sometimes the symptoms are so mild that people do not notice them, so they don’t get tested. And when doctors say they’ll give you a “full std panel” they typically leave out herpes testing. Lots of times people get a “full std panel”, get a call back from the nurse saying they’re negative (very vague, I know), and boom.. they think they’re 110% clean. But that’s just not the case. I think at the end of the day, STDs are very grey and complicated. And how our society treats stds and grey and complicated. I think I’ve learned that when I have sex with someone, it’s a trust fall. Even if you try to cover all of your bases by asking for test results, the partner could of gotten tested too early for the std to show in their system. It’s all about weighing your risks here.

tgxi4d,"Any tips? So recently I started seeing this girl who has genital herpes (for about 3-5 years now), she told me that it spreads when she has an outbreak about twice a year or something like that. As far as I know I’m hsv free and I’m quite paranoid to get infected aswell, what are my chances to be in a relationship and not contract the virus?",3,2022-03-18 05:33:57-04:00,"Do you now which *type* of genital herpes she has? It can be either hsv1 or hsv2. Of the two, genital hsv2 poses a higher transmission risk. But even for genital hsv2, with precautions the risk can be brought down very low. Here are the stats for female-to-male genital hsv2 transmission within the constraints stated:

---

**Female-to-Male ghsv2 transmission:**

In studies of couples in long term relationships (ie together at least 3 months already) where the woman has genital hsv2 and the man doesn't and they both know she has it, if they have unprotected sex for an entire year (approximately twice per week) except during outbreaks and the woman takes no herpes medication, the man has a 4% chance of becoming infected by the end of the year.

Having sex more or less often than twice per week would raise or lower that base figure accordingly. Also note that that base figure comes from studies of couples already in long term relationships, and herpes is slightly more likely to transmit when the partners have been together less than 3 months. We aren't sure exactly *how* much higher the risk is before the 3-month mark, but we know its definitely higher. Herpes is also known to be more active when the infection is recent, most notably during the first 6-12 months of having it (the decline is gradual).

Condom use and herpes medication would each lower the female-to-male transmission risk by about 50% further from whatever it was before. So if the couple uses condoms *or* the woman takes medication, the annual risk to the man comes down to about 2%. And if they use both, it comes down to about 1%.

---

Again, the above stats are for genital hsv2. The risk posed by genital hsv1 would be at least several times *less*. Genital hsv1 is one of the least active kinds of herpes there is and poses considerably less risk of transmission than not only genital hsv2 but also oral hsv1. You'd actually be considerably *safer*, ie considerably less likely of catching oral hsv1 or genital hsv1 from a partner who has genital hsv1 than you would be from a partner who has oral hsv1 -- which more than half the population has. And that's presuming you don't already have oral hsv1 yourself. If you do then you'd be at no practical risk of catching hsv1 genitally -- you'd already have hsv1 antibodies due to your oral infection.

Note that if your partner has genital hsv2 and isn't already taking daily suppressive herpes medication, it would be entirely reasonable for you to ask or even *require* that she go on it in order to reduce the transmission risk to you. Suppressive herpes medication is safe, poses no health risks for even very long term use, is affordable for the vast majority of people, doesn't detract from the sexual experience at all, and would reduce transmission risk to you by about an additional 50% from whatever it was before (which would depend on whether you're using condoms). ### Unfortunately I do not know which type of genital herpes she has , will try to ask her.

tgtqhr,"Anyone else experienced these first OB symptoms? Hi everyone! A month ago (2/17), I (24m) had sex with a girl I was seeing, only to find out afterwards through a text that she had gHSV2. We had intercourse and I received and gave oral. We used a condom, but I think we might have had some skin to skin contact before that, and she’s on aciclovir but she takes both doses in the morning and I read that you’re usually directed to take them throughout the day for max effectiveness. She told me that she’s never had an outbreak but was sieropositive. Anyways, I haven’t noticed any blistering lesions since then, but starting day 2 after exposure, I started feeling a faint burning sensation when I finished urinating (about a 2/10) accompanied by a pinching feeling in my urethra at times. I’ve also noticed some clear liquid at the entrance of my penis and that the tip itself is sensitive. This has lasted for straight up 30 days, and I have no idea what’s going on. Been tested for UTI and all STIs on the usual STI panel twice, and everything’s come back negative. I’ve talked to my doctor and it seems like she’s really hesitant to do a blood test unless I have blisters, but like I can’t imagine this is anything else but HSV with the timing and all.

This is unclear. Which test came back positive for hsv1? Your swab test or your blood test?

>Had sex wit someone and directly after started having to pee often. 

That is known as *urinary urgency*. Herpes would not cause that.

>I have a red bumpy skin irritation on my vulva and anus that doesn't burn when I pee on it.

That sounds unlikely to be herpes. Lots of different things can cause redness and inflammation. Herpes would only cause certain kinds and the kind it can cause would generally not be described as ""bumpy"" unless it were also described as ""blistery"" or having blisters present. (and even then, herpes is not the only condition that can cause blisters in the genital region). Also, herpes lesions usually hurt a fair bit if urine comes into contact with them. 

>and I have pain around my ovaries. 

Herpes wouldn't cause that either. 

Urinary urgency is most often caused by a bladder infection. That could explain your pain also. ### I saw that sores have to be fresh and are less accurate with reoccurrences. The irritations were not there until the day I went to see the doctor I believe, max the day before. This was my first time experiencing something like this. ### You can have hsv1 in the nether regions- hsv1 does not ONLY go to your mouth. And hsv 2 doesn’t ONLY go to your genitals.

I have both and I’ve never had a cold sore 🤷🏼‍♀️ they both appear genitally. ### Thanks for all this response. I didn't take a blood test for HSV1 she swab tested a bump on my vulva I believe. ### I had once or twice where it was a bit stingy on what I think was a bump when I peed but I've peed so many times these past few days and usually there isn't extra stinging. Does it sting always or just on a rare occasion like I am experiencing? ### By bumpy I mean it looks a bit like there are a few red bumps  but they bumps don't look like blisters. It's not overall slightly raised and red. Also I added that a lot of the skin is damp and like peeling but not dry the skin is just too damp. ### > You can have hsv1 in the nether regions- hsv1 does not ONLY go to your mouth. And hsv 2 ONLY go to your genitals.

Please be aware that is incorrect. Hsv2 *can* infect orally, though it doesn't do so very often. ### If you had a swab applied to your genital region and it tested positive for hsv1 then you all but certainly have genital hsv1. Positive swab results are very highly reliable.

Still, you definitely appear to have some other issues going on at the same time: herpes would not cause the urinary urgency or pain around your ovaries. Again, that is most often a symptom of a bladder infection. It's unclear what to make of the damp skin around your anus. If you've had a fungal infection previously then it *could* be a recurrence of that but I obviously can't say for sure. ### I get that this article is from 2013- however it is from planned parenthood and back in 2013- hsv1 accounted for 30% of genital herpes outbreaks.  
That’s a pretty big percentage 🤷🏼‍♀️ ### Nevermind this group has given way more information than Google did so Im starting to understand the situation better. I had just assumed this meant I hard oral herpes. Thanks so much for your help. ### Sorry Im confused what genital hsv1 is vs HSV2. Even on Google it doesn't seem to explain. I had just assumed hsv1 meant oral. I'll try and research again. ### >I get that this article is from 2013- however it is from planned parenthood and back in 2013- hsv1 accounted for 30% of genital herpes outbreaks.

>That’s a pretty big percentage

I don't see what that has to do with my comment that you're replying to?

When I said your comment was incorrect, I was referring to your statement that hsv2 only infects the genitals. 

Upon reading your comment again, I'm now thinking that possibly isn't what you meant and you actually mean the opposite, though your writing in that regard is very unclear. ### There are two types of herpes virus: hsv1 and hsv2. Either type can infect orally or genitally. So a person could have oral hsv1, or oral hsv2, or genital hsv2, or genital hsv2. That being said, oral hsv2 infections are uncommon. Hsv2 has a strong preference for the genital region so the vast majority of hsv2 infections are genital.

Some people mistakenly believe that hsv1 means an oral herpes infection and hsv2 means a genital herpes infection, but that's incorrect, especially regarding genital infections. Hsv1 now accounts for nearly half of new genital herpes infections.

Again: if you had a swab applied to your genital symptoms and it tested positive for hsv1, then you have a genital hsv1 infection. Genital hsv1 is almost always the result of receiving oral sex from a partner who had oral hsv1. Genital hsv1 is one of the least active kinds of herpes, and genital-to-genital hsv1 transmission outside of an active outbreak is very rare. You may find these 2 past comments on genital hsv1 helpful:

So sorry- I realize what I said this morning 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️ I’ll edit the comment if it lets me ### Thank you so much you've been so helpful. It's really kind of you to share as much information as you did. I'm really thankful to have access to this group ### Im only confused about the fact that I'm protected from oral hsv1 now. I always assumed I had oral hsv1 cause I have a memory I had a cold sore once as a child. If this is correct and I already had oral hsv1 how could I get genital hsv1? ### Actually I read posts from people having both ohsv1 and ghsv1 so I guess you can have both and I misunderstood. That clears things up. ### You could have also had like a bacterial infection and not cold sores.

Kids often get small skin or mouth infections at the corner of their lips where bacteria will collect and cause a little infection. That's what happened to me a few times when I was younger and mom thought it was a cold sore but... most likely wasn't. ### >If this is correct and I already had oral hsv1 how could I get genital hsv1?

A pre-existing oral hsv1 infection would, in the vast majority of cases, protect against a later genital hsv1 infection. However, there are rare exceptions. This situation is further unclear because you only remember a single instance of oral symptoms that were never confirmed as being herpes. ### >Actually I read posts from people having both ohsv1 and ghsv1 so I guess you can have both and I misunderstood. 

Again, it is extremely uncommon to catch hsv1 in a second location long after already having an hsv1 infection in another location. It's not impossible, it definitely happens, but it's *very* uncommon.

It's also possible for multiple body locations to get infected during the same encounter, or within 4 months of each other. It takes up to 4 months after the original infection for the body to generate enough antibodies that will, in the vast majority of cases, protect against further infection in other locations. ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tgw0we/hsv1_positive_hsv2_false_negative_swab/

Once a person is infected with a type of herpes in one location, they become largely protected from getting infected with the same type of herpes in another location at a later point in time,  whether by spreading an existing infection on themselves, or getting exposed to a partner's infection. This is because after one is infected with herpes the body creates antibodies to fight the virus. The body maintains these antibodies in the bloodstream and they protect from further infection. Different people generate antibodies at different rates, but by about 4 months post-infection the vast majority of people will have enough antibodies to prevent any further infection by the same type. Many people will have sufficient antibodies a lot sooner than that (eg after several weeks).

There *are* very rare exceptions to the above but that is the general rule.

Within four months of your genital infection you will similarly be protected from catching oral hsv1. ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tgti00/partner_isnt_worried_about_condoms/

I think he's an open minded, kind person and will be accepting, however, there's always the shred of doubt in your mind.

I've told myself I'm going in calm and confident, and will be ok with him either accepting me for me  or if he declines a sexual relationship with me.

In my first year I had 5 outbreaks. I’ve read that in the second year outbreaks decrease or there are none at all.

I just wanted to comment because I really connected to what you’re saying. Thinking about my rape is so hard as it is… to throw an outbreak in there really fucking sucks.

Also my first year was very painful, will I need medication later on if it’s not that painful? ### How long it lasts is really dependent on how quickly I take the meds after it has started! Luckily this time around I had meds on deck so I took them day 1 as soon as the bumps appeared. It’s day 3 or 4 and I barely feel a thing!

tgsef2,"Herpes exposure? On May 6th I had unprotected anal and oral sex with a old fling. We were both tested clean but since regular STD panels in my country don't include for Herpes, I personally never know my status on that front. But I never had an outbreak my entire life or had anyone I had sex with that told me they have it. Cut to yesterday (17/3), this old fling texted me asking if I was tested or showed anything that might indicate herpes because he was showing symptoms the day before (16/3). He told me that the past three weeks he had sex with three different girls although I was the only one who he did unprotected with. The first one was on 23/2 and then me on 6/3. The last girl was on 12/3 and they did unprotected oral and he developed symptoms four days after that. 

Since I hooked up with him, I didn't feel any different. Didn't feel any symptoms whatsoever. I do have a few ingrown hair bumps which I had for months now mainly because I keep on plucking them. 

So my question is how likely is it that he transmitted it to me? Cos I read that for most symptoms shows up within days after exposure and it has been a week and I don't have any symptoms as of now. And how soon would it be best for me to do the blood test if I never show any symptoms? 
TIA.",11,2022-03-17 23:43:36-04:00,"It really depends. The type that he has plays a factor. Who he got it from (when) plays a factor. When he started showing symptoms plays a factor. Do you have any of this info? ### I only know that he started showing symptoms yesterday so he went to a clinic and the doctor said confirmed it as herpes and proceeded to give him antivirus and some topical ointment. He didn't tell me which type he got and I think he himself doesn't know it. So yeah it's still all a blur, even for me. ### there’s obviously a risk, but you could be just fine. Usually, you start being contagious around 48 hours before feeling symptoms. so even if he got it from the girl before you, it’s very possible that you didn’t get it. it’s also most contagious when there is an active breakout, so even if he was shedding when you had sex, you may not have gotten it ### If he had unprotected oral with the girl after you then it’s possible he has ghsv1 .  Did the dr. not swab him to find out which strain he has. 

And to note , condoms do not actually completely stop hsv transmission due to the fact that they do not cover the whole genital area. So they reduce transmission but not to zero. ### Thank you so much for your insight! I wanna say it's a relief but I don't think I'd be truly relieved until I get tested 😅
But do you think it's worth getting the IGG blood test? Because I read some posts here that say it's quite useless unless one takes the western blot which can be quite expensive or swab but that's hard on my case since I'm not showing any non-/visible symptoms. ### No, the dr. didn't do a swab test on him which pretty sucky. I don't even think sexual clinics in my country offer swab test. ### IgG isn’t great but it’s definitely helpful. But you have to wait at least 12 weeks to take it. IgG tests for antibodies, not the actual virus, so you have to give your body enough time to build antibodies to the virus. Unfortunately, even if you have it you’re most likely going to test negative if you take it right now. ### If you get the igg and you test high positive then that is pretty accurate. , It’s the negatives & low positives that may not be accurate.  Always good to have a baseline . ### Yes there is no consistency in what Dr do even within same cites & countries 😞. ### Ah okay, so let's say I'm taking the test four weeks after exposure and it shows neg/low-pos, then I should retake the test at the appropriate time i.e 3-4 months after exposure? ### Yes , if you took it any time after exposure and don’t get a solid positive then retest at the 12 week mark and take it from there . That’s what I would do. Unless you get any suspected OB and get that swabbed within 48 of sores / blisters. ### ",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tgsef2/herpes_exposure/

I am absolutely positive that I got it from him, as I had negative tests beforehand and was not sleeping around. I want to sue the fuck out of him for doing this to me, but I imagine that he could easily claim that I got it elsewhere.

I was a nurse at an OBGYN clinic for a couple of years, and most of my patients who came in and got diagnosed with herpes didn’t come in for herpes to begin with. For example, one day I had a patient who was coming in for a Pap smear after giving birth. When the doctor came in to examine her, she noticed a tiny bump, and the patient genuinely thought it was a razor bump (and I don’t blame her, it looked like a razor bump to me too).Turns out it was herpes. Plus to add to the confusion, most doctors do not test for herpes on a regular STD panel. For the longest time I thought I was std free because my doctor wasn’t up front with exactly every test that was ran on me. I assumed when he said my tests were negative that I was std free 110%. But he didn’t test for herpes, and that’s pretty typical for clinics in the US. I know there are people out there who can be shitheads and purposefully hide their status, and heck, maybe this guy is. But most people just don’t know their true status. ### You can have herpes for YEARS and it be dormant. You could have gotten an outbreak suddenly from many things. In addition even if he gave it to you and he’s never had an outbreak you literally can’t blame him because there’s no way of 100% testing for it without said outbreak. 

Just because someone has a high number of partners doesn’t mean anything. 
I got hsv affer 5 partners and I don’t even know if I got it from one of them or if I got it as a child and just had my first outbreak randomly years later. Because that’s literally how this illness manifests.

Also the only way you could even remotely win a lawsuit is if you have proof BEFORE filing that he knew he had it. 
Because you can’t get a subpoena for someone’s medical records on a simple accusation with no proof. ### Did he not know about it? Because that’s what it sounds like from your post. ### Also it’s pretty much useless to try to sue as it can be very difficult to prove ### [removed] ### You can sue of course and I think you should, because of such people innocent soul get hurt. I don’t know how people can be so reckless and not tell others before intimacy. Knowing the fact that it destroy you mentally for sure and u lose confidence and desire in so many things. 
These people should be fucked up in court. ### Comment removed. Please do not engage in such blatant sexism in this sub. ### Suing is hard because OP would need to be able to prove that they 100% didn’t have it beforehand (have you been tested specifically for herpes or just a general std test? They almost never test for HSV unless you specifically ask them) and op would need to have proof that this guy had tested positive and knew he had it before the encounter. So technically yes you can sue but it’s not so easy as “I didn’t have symptoms before and I do after having sex with him so he definitely gave it to me!” ### ",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tgrmea/partner_lied_about_sti_status/

But personally I would just ask for proof of full panel STI test from both **before having sex**. That way if you know you are positive you can act like you didn’t know and then you find out if THEY have anything because they might.

After divorcing, I recalled that a few years back my wife had told me that her doctor had told her she showed positive for herpes on her bloodwork and that I should get tested. I didn't think anything of it because we had been married over 10 years and I had no plans (so I thought) of ever having other partners, so I never got tested.

There's no way to know with absolute certainty without having actual visible symptoms swab tested. However, if you test positive for hsv2 and have never experienced symptoms orally or genitally then it is far, *far* more likely to be a genital infection. At least a 95% chance, and probably higher.

This is because the vast majority of hsv2 infections are genital -- at *least* 95% and probably higher. Hsv2 has a very strong preference for the genital region. ### ",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tgjiqk/how_do_you_know_if_you_have_hsv2_orally_or/

You're just one of the few who actually know you have it. If someone truly doesn't already have hsv1 and doesn't want to get it they need to never go out in public, never kiss, never share drinks...etc etc. Life has risks. ### I think out of respect you should disclose if you have it genitally, there still is a lot of stigma around HSV in the genital area. Also, it is something you could discuss if you have it orally, out of respect too. Chances are they too have it orally, so no big deal. I know if it was me, I would want to know. It also provides an opportunity to educate another person and spread awareness to help end the stigma - help shed a positive light on it, let people learn and make educated/informed sexual health decisions for themselves. From all that I’ve learned in a short time, I would have wanted to know the risks ahead of time if my partner was aware. Though it’s not common to spread asymptomatically, it is possible. And although it’s hard to pin point it 100%, I can say with most certainty that I got HSV-1 genitally from a partner who has it orally, even though they have not had a cold sore in years (contracted through asymptomatic shedding). They didn’t know it could be passed genitally, I didn’t know they carried it. ### Yeah I tell them, and I don’t ask them to get a full panel test for it. Because frankly it’s immaterial IMO and the psychological impact of knowing versus not knowing is worse than the thing itself. Obviously I ask them if they’ve been tested for other things recently ### I disagree. It's absurd and hypocritical that people with super contagious oral herpes are never expected to disclose , even though the majority (over 50% according to my doctor) of new genital outbreaks are due to someone with oral herpes performing oral sex. And those with the exact same virus on their genitals which has like  1/100th of the risk of spreading is expected to disclose?? ### ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tgj2x4/positive_hsv1/

So back In September 2021 I had an encounter and received oral only. (No symptoms atp)
Now fast forward to October 31 2021 and I ended up getting food poisoning. Every time I went to the bathroom it was like hell from both exits. I went to the doctor and they said it should pass. About a week later I still feel ill so I go back and she ask me what most doctors ask (eating habits, bad habits, sexual history) and I explain everything so she gives me a full panel sti test. I wait a few days and by this time I’m starting to feel better and all my test come back negative. (Hsv1,2 as well)
Now fast forward to January 2022 and I decide to take another sti test just to make sure everything is was still the same and it was but my hsv1 igg levels were an 8( hsv2 neg).
I’ve never had a cold sore and I started really thinking hard to remember if I did and I just can’t remember having one ever. So I wait until 3/10/22 and take another test and still neg for T2 but T1 came back at a 58.00H. I called but the doctor said it’s nothing to worry about.
To this day I have no symptoms and just feel really depressed. Like I understand it’s extremely common but I haven’t even worked up the strength to say it out loud yet.
 Should I take another test like the western blot? Or should I just take the L and continue living life regularly? Again sorry for the rant and any advise would really help.

I’m lucky, don’t have outbreaks but maybe that’s cos after finding out I quit smoking and started hitting the gym. Annoyingly with my newly chiselled rig and overall better aroma I’m attracting way more women than ever so my disclosure rate has shit through the roof.

That is very unlikely to be a herpes issue. Are you saying that it started during your first outbreak and has persisted since? If so, how long has this been going on for?

Herpes can cause sometimes lingering sensations after a first-time outbreak over the ensuing weeks but they are usually fairly mild and not consistent with what you're describing. However, some women have been known to develop a yeast infection during their first herpes outbreak, and the yeast infection can sometimes persist well after the herpes outbreak has cleared. Some women in this situation then mistake their yeast symptoms as herpes symptoms. So that is one possibility here, though I can't say how likely it is.

There are other things that can cause chronic burning sensations in the genital region as well.

You weren't clear about the timeline but if this burning has been going on for more then a week after your outbreak has cleared then I suggest you run your situation by a doctor. ### Have you tried a acv bath? ### No? ### Is it like just a cap full or how does that work ? ### I think you should, it helps a lot ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tgn3ij/home_remedies_or_something/
tgcjgf,"A Cautionary Tale I was first diagnosed in late 2018 when I got a genital rash on my labia I thought was razor burn. When it kept getting worse I went to an urgent care doc who diagnosed me visually and wrote a Valtrex script but didn't swab. 

By the time I made it to my PCP, the swab was negative probably because it had been too long and was healing. My blood test was positive for HSV1 and negative for HSV2 and I got the same results a few months later. My doctor said she wasn't sure it the genital outbreak was actually herpes and that the HSV1 result could be old and wasn't a big deal at all.

I probably deceived myself by clinging to this possibility too hard and then genuinely forgot about it for a long time since I didn't have a second outbreak. For the next 3 years I was either single or in a relationship where we weren't intimate so it just never affected my life.

However in late last year, I got in a new relationship where we've been intimate and because it had been no big deal for so long, unfortunately I didn't disclose. We haven't talked about STDs ever so it was a lie of omission but still a deception. Our sex is pretty low risk and I honestly didn't think about it in the beginning.

However, I had an outbreak in early February (we didn't have sex during this time) and since then my life has been consumed with paranoia and guilt over this. I honestly think that stress has been affecting my health and I think she can tell I'm holding something back. I got a daily Valtrex prescription to try and further reduce risk but I honestly just can't live with this anymore.

I've decided I'm going to tell her next week. She's a doctor so will know the medical side already but I've accepted that my deception will end things. It hurts terribly to think about what I've done to her and the fact that I will lose someone I care about so much but I need to move forward with this. She deserves an honest partner and I need to start living in the light. 

I'm writing this to provide accountability to myself to have this hard conversation and to try and show the impact of non-disclosure to anyone wavering. An early rejection stings but the pain of this has been so hard. I know if I'm ever lucky enough to have a relationship again, I will disclose first thing.",1,2022-03-17 11:17:16-04:00,"Or you could be honest and tell her that, previously, your situation was unclear and your initial doctor messed up by not swabbing you. That led to later ambiguity when you did the responsible thing and pursued further testing, both swab and blood testing. You tested positive for hsv1, which *does* present considerable ambiguity if a person only presented with ambiguous symptoms initially -- when half the population will blood test positive for hsv1 because of how common oral hsv1 is. And that was mirrored by you doctor's comments. 

So you could approach the situation by telling your partner ""Hey, something's come up that I need to tell you about"". Relate the above, and how you only very recently experienced a genital outbreak that clarified everything, and so you want to bring this up with her. Also familiarize yourself with how low a risk genital hsv1 poses to partners. Even if your partner is a doctor, she may not be aware of this. Check out these two past comments regarding genital hsv1:

I think it's discussed in the links above but also be aware that if your partner already happens to have hsv1 herself, even orally, your genital infection would pose no practical risk to her at all. She would already have hsv1 antibodies and be at no practical risk of further hsv1 infections in other locations.

This is a copy/paste of my disclosure advice to someone 

Disclosing is the main time herpes sucks. You can do it face to face, by text, over the phone… however you feel most comfortable. There are a couple general rules I follow that have always worked for me.

Work your disclosure into a conversation. You’re waiting on your moment. If he shares something personal, be supportive & then share about herpes.

Be short, factual, and concise. Don’t word vomit facts in one long run on sentence (I have done this before & it wasn’t pretty). Something along the lines of, “since you were open with me, I wanted to let you know that I have the herps. I take meds to keep it under control & prevent transmission & I’ve never passed it on,  Ask me whatever you’d like & ill always be open & honest about it”    Or , since this is more casual, “ask me whatever you want but I promise the sex will he hotttt” . Open the door to him asking questions about statistics or more details. Closing with something dirty will usually make them forget everything else you just said. Men are easily distracted by sex 😂

Just suggestions. All disclosures are different based on your relationship to the person & what the goal of the relationship is ### Ah man I’m repeating myself haha… ok so I just go with. (After date one if I think they’re cool)

“So I found out couple years back I must’ve had herpes before…. You probably do too” (I’m a bit of a joker)

But seriously the hardest thing is saying the word “herpes” out loud and it’s all plain sailing after that

Once the shock wears off I hit em with a couple of statistics and then say, “look, I haven’t had outbreaks and wouldn’t have even known unless my overly thorough graduate medical doctor wasn’t trying to impress his senior clinician by giving me a full screen”

“But I respect whatever decision you want to make, as sadly, somewhere down the track I wasn’t offered the same opportunity to make that decision”

“Oh and by the way, there is genuinely a better than evens chance you have herpes anyway”

🤣🤣

Obviously I tweak it here and there but I couldn’t care less anymore I only say it because it’s morally right ### Would love to hear what ppl say for their disclosures ### ",7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tg77al/can_we_start_a_thread_of_disclosures_pls/
tgkahw,"Initial herpes infection Can anyone tell me if a runny nose is common with an initial HSV2 infection?  I have seen body aches, swollen lymph nodes, and headache on most literature, but have also seen runny nose or congestion thrown in some places online.  Just curious how common that truly is.",4,2022-03-17 17:05:07-04:00,">Can anyone tell me if a runny nose is common with an initial HSV2 infection?

No, herpes would definitely not cause a runny nose.

When it is said that herpes can cause flu-like symptoms, this is referring to symptoms similar to those of *influenza* (ie the flu) ie headache, fever, general body aches all over (not highly focused in and limited to a very specific area), light sensitivity, and swollen lymph nodes near the region of infection but not elsewhere (eg in the groin for genital infections, or in the head/neck for oral infections). Herpes would *not* cause symptoms of a cold, ie stuffy nose, runny nose, sore throat, cough, congestion, sinus issues, etc. (Oral herpes *could* cause a sore throat if it were to cause actual lesions in the throat itself, but that is very rare.)

Furthermore, the only circumstance in which herpes has the potential cause flu-like symptoms is from from a brand new infection that occurred within 2-10 days prior, and such symptoms would only occur if the person was experiencing at least moderate-to-extensive visible blisters/lesions as well, that would appear within a day or two of the flu-like symptoms, if not sooner. ### [deleted] ### >Ooohfuck- thank you so much about the fever needing to be in unison with outbreaks!

You're very welcome.

>On day 3 - 7 for me I had a constant temp of 99.5ish. In addition I had chills, fatigue and the skin all around my testicles and taint feel like they are burning still to now on day 8. I keep checking 2x a day and do not see lesions/sores. Went and tested a 10 panel today for a baseline, should I retest at 6 weeks?

Well your symptoms aren't suggestive of herpes in the first place, so herpes testing would not be warranted regarding these particular symptoms. ### [deleted] ### >Ooohfuck- the severe burning sensation all over in the groin and taint, tingling on thighs, and everything else isn't indicative of herpes? 

That's correct.

> I have never had anything like this and the tingling began 24 hours after. Any idea what can present this way?

One of the most common conditions to cause fairly widespread tingling and burning sensations in the genital region is a fungal infection, aka ""jock itch"". But there can be other possibilities as well. Also, I don't know how much of your thighs are affected or how likely it would be for a fungal infection to include a considerable portion of your thighs. The parts of the thighs further away from the groin would be far less susceptible to jock itch because they'd get better ventilation. ### [deleted] ### When people have sex they also exchange germs, bacteria, fungal cultures, and possibly viruses. Any of these things have the potential to cause reactions. Having sex with someone is also a great way to catch a cold or flu. It isn't at all clear why you seem to be considering herpes as the only possible cause of your symptoms. 

I have attempted to explain to you, fairly extensively, that herpes would not be causing the symptoms you're experiencing. I don't think there's much else I can say that I haven't already. So at this point I'm going to  consider this discussion closed. ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tgkahw/initial_herpes_infection/

Is this true?

No, that is false. Herpes cannot be spread by inanimate objects/surfaces in that fashion.

Herpes expert Terri Warren, who has a 35+ year career researching and treating herpes specifically, has repeatedly stressed that herpes *cannot* be transmitted via drinking straws, cups, utensils, cigarettes/joints/bongs, shared food items, or inanimate objects or surfaces in general. Herpes is a very fragile virus that cannot live long outside the body and requires both moisture and warmth to survive. Also, a certain *volume* of virus is required in order to cause an infection. A small trace amount is insufficient. Terri has stated that the only inanimate objects that pose any practical risk of *oral* transmission are lipsticks / chapsticks / lip gloss because the particular properties of these items can sometimes sustain the virus for short periods and they can sometimes be used by another person immediately after someone who might be contagious. Similarly, she has stated that the only inanimate objects that pose any risk for *genital* transmission are shared sex toys that, again, might be used by another person immediately after a person who is infected. She also advises people with genital infections to not share bath towels *when they are having an outbreak*, but expects the risk of transmission in this manner to still be extremely unlikely.

Here is one such quote from Terri on her clinic forum where she addresses the issue and responds to someone asking about potential transmission from sharing a phone:

>the only inanimate objects I am at all concerned about are sex toys and lipsticks. We do advise individuals not to share warm moist towels, but even transmission in this way is extremely unlikely. The phone is not the kind of contact that transmits herpes. There has to be more contact than that. To acquire herpes, there is a certain amount of virus that need to be present and it is not a tiny amount. I guess if a person had a big cold sore and was rubbing their cold sore actively into the phone and then the next person came up immediately afterwards and started putting the phone in their mouth, there might be a 1% chance of transmission. It just doesn’t happen this way.

([Source](https://www.westoverheights.com/forum/question/mouth-outbreaks-and-transmission-through-phone-sharing/)) ### Ugh. I hate this man. I am new to the diagnosis and the changes in my life.

Anyways I caught my ex cheating with another man and I for one immediately knew this relationship was over and two wanted to get tested .
When i got tested I honestly didn't know what to think but I did know whatever the outcome was I was gonna make it .
When the doctor diagnosed me when HSV2 of course I was devastated because I mean when people talk about herpes they talk about it like you will constantly have warts and breakouts and your life is over so I'm here to tell you it's not .

It is easier for the top to transmit the virus but condoms cut the odds down by up to 96% and antivirals cut it down by another 50%. For bottoms it is harder to transmit from the top but condoms are around 40% less effective at preventing transmission to the top. Antivirals also cut the chance of transmission down by 50%. And there is already a very low chance of transmission if you do not have an outbreak and recognize your prodromal symptoms and don't have sex when you feel like an outbreak is coming on. Studies show that HSV+ people who know their status are 50% less likely of transmitting it to their partner and 80-90% of people with HSV have no idea that they have it so yeah just do the math lol.

If this virus has told me anything, it’s to be really picky about the mentality of who you date, because I would never date anyone who had any negative comment to make about herpes.

Especially in a small minded town with small minded people. 

Even without HSV, so many people, especially women, choose to stay with shitty and abusive partners because of the fear that being a single parent in a small town means they’ll be on the shelf forever. 

And if you choose to stay—I would never blame you. 

But you truly deserve better, and I do wholeheartedly believe that better is out there. Even in a small town. 

I grew up in a very small minded place and still saw courageous women leave their partners and find love when they had kids as a single mom. 

You deserve so much more than a man who manipulates you into believing that you gave him HSV2 and that this is the end of the world and you have to stay because of it.

If you’re too young to never have sex again, you’re too young to be saddled with this shitty man for the rest of your life—why give some of your best years to a man who hurts you and treats you so poorly? 

HSV2 is so much more common than we think it is, and for many people, it’s a relatively mild condition. I think disclosure is important and that safe sex is too—but I know that many people will still want you, regardless of your status. 

Even though there is stigma, there is also so much more information about living with HSV out there than ever before. You can be well informed, and so can your partners.

People are more understanding about herpes than you’d think—especially if you can explain the facts to them and talk clearly and in a straightforward way about what you do to take care of your own health and what you do to practice safe sex. ### I promise you will find a new partner.  Don't stay in an unhappy relationship just because you have HSV. Breaks my heart to hear you're feeling unworthy because of this. There are people out there who will love and accept you unconditionally. ### Herpes is never a good enough reason to leave a good relationship, but more importantly, it's never a reason to stay in a bad one.

If you break your post down, you are saying that you feel so bad about yourself, that you are staying in an abusive relationship - with your kids - because you are too young to NOT HAVE SEX AGAIN. 

I can only hope this is your depression talking, or your fear of being alone, because it sounds like you are putting a lot of things ahead of your safety, and that of your kids' safety. 

Get counseling. Do it today. Start looking for ways to leave this man. If you have to leave town, do so. If you have to stand on the steps of city hall and shout that you have herpes just to own it and take your life back, do that. 

Everyone has shit they worry about people not accepting. Everyone. Let it go and own it, and focus on your safety. 

Don't let your insecurities become priority over your safety or that of your kids. Even if this man never lays a single hand on the kids, they'll know he's abusing you, even if it's only emotional abuse. I grew up in that kind of house. Kids always know. 

You deserve better, no matter what. ### 
I got herpes from my ex a few months into our relationship. I stayed for 3 years. Don’t do it. He was emotionally abusive and manipulative and I definitely was scared to go partially because of my diagnosis but honestly? You have nothing to worry about. Some people will understand, others won’t. But here’s what I have come to accept at the end of the day… I don’t want to date someone who would react badly to a disclosure anyways. And you shouldn’t either, because that says a lot about that person. 

Being vulnerable is hard, and disclosing is weird and I don’t know if it ever stops being weird but I promise you, it gets better. 

My ex and I have been broken up for about 4 months now and I’ve had a few people I wanted to hookup with (met on apps) turn me down, but I’ve never had anyone I liked, and who liked me back turn me down. The research is out there, the information is there. If someone likes you enough, or quite frankly - respects you they will be willing to read it. 

Sending you love. You and your kiddos deserve better. We love you! ### Please don't stay because your feelings towards sex. A relationship is so much more than sex. You will find a man who will give you a relationship, which will include sex. Don't stay where it's abusive. There are good people around. ### I didn’t read all the messages I read your post, I’ve been with a horrible person who gave me hsv2 and I’m so angry and frustrated and have been crying since 2015…..
I don’t know if I’ll even be able to find someone to have a family with as I have this thing and I’m 42 now, depressed and having Outbreaks every 2 weeks. Honestly if my parents weren’t alive maybe I wouldn’t see the reason for me to continue like this. The rest of my family didn’t help me when I needed it they actually put obstacles to frustrate me even from their side they treated me like some sort of bullies.
I believe that you are lucky to have children and that you and them need a good respectful man by your sides and not one who’s with you for the same reason that you mentioned that you stato with him so since you both have the sti then you’re worried to find someone who’ll be with you, even I think that your partner wouldn’t have problems since he didn’t disclose with you. 
The more you stay with someone who doesn’t respect you as a human being, a partner, a mother, a female the more you let him bombard your self esteem so by staying with him you let him abuse you.
Is sex that important? 
no one dies without it and one can stay without it until a human partner is found. 
The other option is for the 2 of you to go to a counsellor.
I wish you good luck ### If you stay then you have gsh2 and a toxic relationship. If you leave, you only have gsh2. ### That's a tough situation, when you say small town... like are we talking population 200? If you're young and can support yourself and your kids you don't need to stay in that situation, you can always leave. I'm pretty sure most guys are more accepting of it. My ex's best friend had it and she had no problems dating guys, she told us they always knew too. ### Don't you dare stay in abusive relationship cuz you got herpes really it ain't like you get ready to die it's a f****** disease you ain't got cancer to stay in a abusive relationship you got to love yourself first okay.  I don't care if nobody else don't love you ever love yourself and that don't mean you ain't going to get into another relationship I thought the same things 30 years ago I had herpes for 30 years I had all types of boyfriends I've been married twice nobody gave a damn about that s*** I disclosed we never thought about it again you hear me.  please don't stay abusive relationship because you got herpes simplex virus and thinking u are not good enough yes you are your even better because you love yourself first and foremost cuz that man or that woman can kill you and if he's  or she a narcissist he's counting on you to stay there.  abusive relationship for you can end up with something worse like PTSD or your head knocked off on a coma or somewhere hell no get up and stop feeling sorry for yourself and move on and start loving yourself for who you are and hell with herpes. ### You won’t. Make the best of it or be happy being alone. 23+ years positive and only had two takers after being diagnosed. ### Don’t stay in any kind of abusive relationship for any reason. You said it. You are attractive. You will have sex again. It’s only transmissible when you have an outbreak. We need a group to hook up with other people with herpes ### Your a woman you’ll always find sex get outta there ### I can’t agree more. It’s a very common STI and a lot of people have it but it lays dormant. I think you need to consider your kids as well. What kind of impact you’re having on your babies? Break the cycle! Give yourself time. It has helped me so much 💕 ### The fact that this man let you believe that you gave him herpes and gaslit you for years is enough to leave. He also willingly gave you an STI and you weren’t able to consent to the relationship from the start without knowing this, what an absolute piece of shit ### I was in a similar situation. Like felt bad to leave because thinking oh now someone else won't want me and stayed in a bad relationship for longer than I should have had. Making the decision was hard but I felt so much better since I did. Honestly. Many people would still want you! It's harder to think that way until you're actually told that but my ex said something very nice when I've told him (we're good friends). He said that I'm a human being and not a sex toy and anyone should want me for everything else rather than just for my vagina. Sure one time things would be harder but even that hasn't stopped me. Anyone I've told they said that it doesn't change anything for them. They'd prefer being more careful but I don't see why that's a bad thing. ### I recommend the book I think its called 8 steps to healing shame and codependency. I have picked shitty guys too. ### Hello,  

I must say you have some deeper issues that exist outside of herpes. 

Your sense of low self worth started long before herpes and you need to come to terms with that portion. There are clearly some home issues or abandonment issues that resonate deep within you. 

Sex seems to be your escape route or proof to yourself that someone cares about you or something. 

You can not move past this issue until you examine the deeper issues that created all of your circumstances. There is a deeper reason why you must feel wanted by a man. You need to work on that before you can get the courage to stand on your own and have the confidence to walk through this life. ### I think he gave it to me too. :( ### You sound like a bad ass person and I love it!! ### Agree with you here just leave ### Yes!!!! ### It’s not that I’m feeling unworthy, it’s just where I live, people are very small minded. I would move, but I have a successful business here. I think I just have to take the chance. Being single is better than being abused. I’m making a plan, going to see some places tomorrow and staying with loved ones for a few weeks. Thank you for you kind response!! ### Your post made me cry. I am in counseling. It’s not just the sex, it’s the kids. Our that we have together and ones from previous relationships. They will all be affected. 

I’m scared I’m letting this stupid skin condition affect my decision making, so I came here for support. Your post is so right on. I know the kids know. They always know. My kid heard him berating me this weekend and said they got scared, so I left. I’m somewhere safe. 

Thank you for your words. They mean a lot. ### If you are having such frequent outbreaks please see your Dr and get on some antivirals? If u are already on some then they aren't working and try some others
No wonder u feel down you poor thing!
I am only 5 months into my diagnosis but the antivirals are keeping mine at bay thank God.  I couldn't stand to go thru another episode like my initial one(s)  Its so unfair that horrible dishonest people have left us to deal with this
I feel your pain xx ### I’m talking island in the middle of no where, where most people are uneducated. And probably most people have it but they don’t get tested. 😔 ### Mine was the girl friend I never trusted for two years that he told me I was crazy to worry about.. My inbox is open if you want someone to talk to who understands. I know how you feel 100%💕🙏🏻 ### Thank you 🥲 I really do try ### I can understand that, I'm from a small southern town. I also have two girls and both of their bio fathers aren't in their lives. I wish you the very best! ### I'm so happy you are somewhere safe. 💖

My parents were so toxic with each other - I honestly couldn't tell you which one was worse. I can tell you they cared more about not divorcing for the sake of image than they did about us. They could argue for hours - screaming, yelling, hateful things - about what to have for dinner. Obviously, I know now it wasn't about dinner, but as a kid, I didn't. I'd have rather come from a broken home than lived in one.

There is always sex, always another man. Even with herpes, even if you had 5 kids from 5 different men. There is always someone who will want you. I don't know what it is about this world that makes so many of us - herpes or not - think that because we have kids, or can't have kids, or have a lot of money, or not enough, or we're tall, short, thin, overweight, too smart, not smart enough, blah blah blah, we are not good enough.

You're still a prize. You don't ever need to settle. Stay safe. ❤️ ### Thank you ❤️ ### But isn’t it risky to take antivirals everyday for ever? I’m concerned about the side effects that they can have ### As far as I know they are very safe to take long term
People with HIV take them constantly and if you get shingles you are prescribed 6 tablets a day. The Dr told me they are very safe. And honestly they are way preferable to me than a painful outbreak! ### Well if most people probably have it then I think the odds of you finding someone else isn't so bad  :). Have you tried dating apps outside of your zip code? Like the nearest big city? I'm sure there are opportunities there. ### I am in a big city, but people here are small minded. I’m in Honolulu so no cities close by. But I’ve been away for the situation for a few weeks now and I’m already feeling so much better about myself and my future ☺️ ### Lol oh! I thought you meant island figuratively. Yeah, my idea is a little hard to pull off then I guess. Glad you are feeling better and things are improving. ### ",30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tfyiuc/i_think_im_staying_in_an_emotionally_abusive/
tgdb7t,"I just got told about an hour ago that I e got herpes Sorry, I’m sure these kinds of posts are very common and annoying here, but I’m freaking out.

My doctor has been trying to reach me for a few days now, he finally told me today that I’ve caught it. The only encounter I can think of where I could’ve caught it was over a year ago! I haven’t even had a breakout yet (at least I don’t think so?). He said it’s genital, but I probably caught it from giving oral so then he said it’s probably both type 1 and 2? I don’t really understand it

He said if I haven’t had any symptoms then not to worry about it, but how do I know if I’ve spread it or not? I felt reassured when he said it only spreads when you have the sores, but not Google is telling me it can spread regardless. I can’t even kiss my family or my little brother because I’m scared they’ll just get it. For all I know I’ve been spreading it and I’ve passed it to one of them (assuming that’s how it works). I’m just very confused and nervous, I don’t want anyone near me I feel like I’ll somehow spread it, I’d feel a lot better if it was just type 2 and I don’t gotta worry about my mouth but again the doctor said it’s probably both types

Sorry for ramble, any help is appreciated

Edit: I just realised my doctor probably thinks I received oral and not that I gave which is why he may think I could have both? When most likely I just have hsv-2? I’m not sure, but if I have 2 does that mean I can’t spread it through saliva or how does it work I’m confused",20,2022-03-17 11:52:08-04:00,"Take a deep breath. You’re gonna be okay. If he said It’s genital and you probably caught it during oral sex then it’s most likely ghsv1. If the other person had it genitally then it’s ghsv2. Since it’s only genitally then you don’t have to worry about spreading it to your family via touching/kissing/toilet. You can only transfer with genital contact. Yes, it can be transmitted even if you don’t have any sores. If you’re having an outbreak ask your doc for an antiviral. ### Your doctor sounds clueless about HSV.

Ask for your actual test results. They should tell whether you have HSV-1, HSV-2, or both. 

70% of HSV transmissions happen when there are no symptoms. It’s more contagious with sores.

HSV-1 and HSV-2 can occur orally or genitally. 

This isn’t the end of your sex life. It’s a simple disclosure most people accept. 

But yes, for now stop kissing family on the lips. ;) ### Doctors really don’t know too much about one or two, a lot of time, even the common test that they use is not very good and makes a lot of mistakes! HSV2 can give a lot of false positives with an index number from 1.1 to 3.5! Ask for your levels, and then get a western blot test. You can get HSV one or two in any location , someone does not have to have any symptoms to pass it ### My doctor did say it was 2 but as soon as I explained it was oral he said it could be both so I’m not fully sure what to think, I was nowhere near the person’s mouth

Although that is assuming I got it from who I think I got it from ### The doctor advice includes myths, but said OP “probably caught it from GIVING oral”. If true, this implies OP’s mouth is infected ### My doctor also told me as long as the virus is not active i can't transmit it to other people ### Hey type 2 can also be in the mouth. Have you had sores in the mouth? Bit your genitals have been fine all year! Herpes is actually not big of a deal, 67% of people have hsv1 and hsv1 are also found in genitals! Also, there is a false positive if you have had chicken pox, small pox, and measles.

Your doctor seems confused as he was not clear of which HSV, go to another doctor that specify it for you. ### Did you test negative for Type 1?

Type 2 can infect your mouth, your genitals, or both. If you don’t know which sex act(s) transmitted it, it could be in either, rarely both. ### You can transmit it without sores. ### Oooh ok thank you thank you, wait so what’s the difference between 1 and 2? I thought at first 1 was all oral and 2 was genitals ### Uuuh I don’t know if I got negative for 1 all he said was that I have genital herpes. I know it most likely than not was from giving oral ### That's what people are telling me here and what I read on Google, but my doctor told me otherwise. I even made sure to ask her clearly and she still said I can't transmit it when is not active. 
She said something about IgG results and that if it showed IgG I can't transmit it.

I'm just confused.
I don't see the reason for straight up lying to me ### No HSV1 can be both oral and genital. It just happens that HSV1 can go to babies from kisses and sharing drinks and food. I had oral herpes ever-increasing middle school and I was not kissing anybody lol. HSV1 is way more common 67% then HSV2 11%. HSV2 just have a more stigma as it is less common but keep in mind that the 67% and 11% are from people who actually got tested for herpes. It is actually believed that around 90% have hsv1 and 2 as so many people are not showing symptoms.  
When you do your STD panel testing, THEY DON'T TEST FOR HERPES, YOU HAVE TO ASK THEM TO TEST FOR HERPES. 
Everyone you meet who are sexually active in any way, ORAL included, are most likely to have herpes.
Also blood test are not accurate as you can get false negative and false positive. 

THE MOST ACCURATE way to know is swab test from an active outbreak. If you don't have outbreaks there is no point really as even if you test for herpes, it could be in your mouth and not genitals ### Antibody tests wouldn’t tell you If it’s genital ir oral, only if you have type 1 or type 2. If you have type 2 and caught it from giving oral you have OHSV-2.. Oral HSV-2. ### She’s clueless about HSV based on the other things she said. Look to WebMD, Mayo Clinic, WHO, CDC, or the Herpes Handbook. All solid sources. ### Yeah I’m definitely a bit lost, I’ve set up another phone appointment with my doctor to ask him more questions. If it’s alright to ask are you able to hide outbreaks with simple makeup? In the event I do have one I’d rather my family never know I’ve got it ### I have genital not oral so unsure on that one. Genital HSV is easy to hide, lol. ### Lolol you’re right that must be a lot easier to hide ### I have had oral herpes since 12, huge sore on my my mouth, trust me, you can not hide it but ibuprofen clears it faster for me lol.

I have never had symptoms and I felt suicidal I probably gave this person herpes. I went to an STD clinic and was told since I dont have symptoms not to worry and just forget about it. I looked up online that you can get a blood test but they commonly give false negatives or positives. So if I get thr test and it is negative am I supposed to just go through life not telling anyone as apparently the emphasis is only on people who get outbreaks or who pursue additomal tests to have to potentially ruin sexual relationships going forward. 

Do I have to base my sexual future and future partners well being on a coin flip on a test that is not fully accurate?

tggd6t,"another is this herpes post hello all! i just wanted to raise some concerns to your awareness and i would appreciate it if you all could use your best judgment.

I am a 21F who has never been tested for HSV1 or HSV2. I get my regular std panels done often but it has recently come to my attention that HSV1/2 is not regularly screened.
First of all, wtf doctors, atleast tell us!!
second of all, ive had maybe 23 partners my whole life (church girl went to college and took freedom too seriously). Most were protected but many weren't. Ive tested negative for all stis/stds that are regularly tested.
I recently developed a yeast infection (i started using flushable wipes more, don't know if that would trigger it) before my period and recognized a dull pain on my right lower abdomen. I also started getting intense headaches. I went to the gyno and she suspects it could be ovarian cysts. I also realized I started to get more ingrowns (granted, i was shaving more often however I did start using a  shaving gel) which i asked her about and she was positive it was folliculitis. I am done with my period and the abdominal pain is still there (not intense so very bearable) but my yeast infection is back. bc of the weird symptoms i started researching and herpes came up for things mistaken for a yeast infection. i keep overly checking for sores and nothing is there. i have no tingling or soreness or pain around my vagina but it is itchy. it doesn't hurt or burn when i pee. 

I started having sex with a new partner since january. he got tested for everything and nothing came up (was not tested for hsv1/2 as no one is) before we had sex. ultimately, Considering how many partners i've had, i've been in my head about my likelihood of getting it or already having it. ive never had a cold sore or anything like that for as long as my memory could recall. 

do my symptoms relate to anything hsv1/hsv2 related? this whole side pain has really thrown me off so idk what else it could be, the diagnosis was not satisfactory to me and genuinely considering my likelihoods just bc of my body count has made me spiral 

reading throughout this thread, i have gotten to know a lot and i know it won't be the end of my world. i would just appreciate your insights.",6,2022-03-17 14:09:21-04:00,"It’s not included on regular tests because the test make a lot of mistakes and cause a lot of unnecessary pain and worry! Give a lot of false positives and negatives! Is recommended that you’re not even tested for it unless you have physical symptoms. The only way to know for sure is if you get a swab from a sore or a western blot! A western blot can be a little bit expensive! My suggestion would be to never take an IgG or IGM test! Do what you need to do for your peace of mind! A lot of things can resemble certain things but you don’t know until you know and the only way to know is to invest in an accurate test ,so that’s totally up to you! You can get either HSV one or two in either location, using protection obviously gives you a better chance of not passing it or getting it but it doesn’t eliminate the risk!

Is recommended that you’re not even tested for it unless you have physical symptoms. The only way to know for sure is if you get a swab from a sore or a western blot!

That isn't entirely true. False positives on IgG tests occur in the low-positive range. Values above that range are much more reliable. Positive index values around 6 or above are *extremely* reliable.

So, when it comes to IgG tests, negative results can be a bit uncertain. But with positive results, the index value gives you a good idea of how reliable the result is, and whether confirmatory testing is recommended. In many cases, positive IgG results are entirely sufficient to confirm infection.

This is discussed in more detail on our wiki page on herpes testing: [LINK](https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/wiki/herpes_testing). ### yknow what, my older sister (33f) was diagnosed with PCOS a couple of years ago, i wouldnt put it past me ### Correct low positives often times can be false. Between 1.1 and 3.5 typically! The CDC recommends that you really don’t get tested unless you have physical symptoms. ### > The CDC recommends that you really don’t get tested unless you have physical symptoms.

That isn't entirely true either. The CDC doesn't recommend testing if a person hasn't experienced symptoms *and* has no particular reason to think they might have it. There are reasons where people can have particular concerns about having caught herpes despite not having experienced symptoms. ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tggd6t/another_is_this_herpes_post/

No. If herpes were to cause penile discharge, the only kind of discharge it would cause would be clear and very watery/runny. Plus, this would only happen if actual herpes lesions were occurring inside the urethra, which would be uncommon in general and even more uncommon to happen without external visible lesions on the outside of the penis occurring as well. Furthermore, if herpes lesions were occurring inside the urethra then urinating would be extremely painful. ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tgga4c/question/

People get rejected every day for a plethora of different reasons Sure there are people who ghosted me especially on tinder but as I talked to my friends I realized they got ghosted too and it wasn’t because of herpes it was because dating apps are cesspools in general. Dating nowadays sucks for so many reasons if you want to pin it on herpes go for it but that’s not the only reason. I was diagnosed with ghsv-1 at 19 and I thought my life was over I didn’t tell a soul cut off friends and everything because I felt so disgusting and gross. But eventually I put myself out there and had a few positive disclosure s and i began to realize that I was the one creating the stigma for myself.. The more people I told the less it weighted me down. Think of it logically friends should care because it doesn’t effect them. The only people your herpes effects are the people you are sleeping With. Friends are supposed to be your support system and if you tell them your story they should not judge you And they will learn from you And your experience. Hell you May even help a fellow herpes person out becuase if someone discloses to your friend after you teach them about herpes they will be more understanding and knowledgeable about it. But that’s up to you. I’ll attach some links that have seemed to help people and if you need anything please dm me.I’ve had it for almost a decade at this point and have a pretty good handle on it.

This first link is info about a support group I’m in. All herpes people from all over the world we all share are experiences, vent , swap info and remedies, and just talk about life it’s an awesome place to be for sure.

This is a list of social Medias about herpes. Sometimes it does people good to see people being public about it and the amount of support they receive from strangers. The accounts are funny and informative and all herpes positive. There is everything on there from podcasts, YouTube, TikToks, blogs, Facebook support groups, Instagram pages, dating pages, subreddits, and websites.

Please reach out if you need anything!! I promise it gets better! ### Thank you ❤️ ### > Ghsv1 however, is less likely to be passed. The rate for transmission from it is less than hsv1 oral.

Is it really?? ### Genital HSV1 TYPICALLY (emphasis on typically) doesn’t lay dormant. Most people have a reaction right away, very intense and then either never again or very sparingly. ### I believe so! I tested negative and my partner’s previous sexual partner was 4 years back, so his must have been dormant for at least 4 years ### Hey, please no shaming. I come from an extremely harsh culture. This isn’t making me jump ship — I am just dealing with an unexpected and confusing situation and doing my best to figure out how to move forward. Thank you for your opinion ### Of course! Feel free to message me girl ❤️ I have gathered a lot of info about ghsv1 since I was just diagnosed myself. It’s been hard, but I learned a lot and it helped me ### Yes because hsv1 is normally oral. So it has fewer outbreaks and less shedding time, is what I’ve been told and read ### If he just had an OB now after a year together it’s also possible that you are the one that gave it to him.  Igg test for hsv1 has a 30 false negative rate. So it’s still quite possible that you are positive. ### I tested recently about 2-3 months since last sexual activity and I’m negative still. I wonder if it’s dormant then?🤔 interesting! Never knew that🤷🏽‍♂️ ### Sorry what is igg test? ### That why we read about Dr. not necessarily promoting the igg without OB , it can be inaccurate. If it comes out a high positive then you know you have it , but now positives can can be false positive and 30% of negs with hsv1 and 8 % of hsv2 can be false negs. 

Western blot is a better choice but more costly and harder to obtain. ### Igg is a blood antibody test for hsv. People can have it with or without and outbreak to hopefully find out if the have hsv. Some drs. will also give an igm or igm only, should be avoided as been shown to not be an appropriate test for hsv and inaccurate. ### Interesting! I never knew what! Hmmm I might have it then🤷🏽‍♂️ expected it eventually 😅 ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tgfn3x/so_lostplease_give_advice/

tg9mks,"Can herpes cause only burning? 

Several years ago in 2017, I was tested for herpes.
If I was exposed- it happened in late June of 2017 or early July 2017.
I went to a doctor just to be checked and make sure, no issues- just paranoid.
She did a herpes test.
IGG on 
July 19th was 1.11
July 31st was 1.26
September 1st was .78

In lieu of no symptoms, and IGG not rising she dismissed the herpes diagnosis, which caused me a lot of emotional distressed.

Fast forward

In 2018 I had a baby.
Followed by IUD, IUD removed, Birth control.
The constant rise and fall of hormones caused me to get a infection ( BV) in April 2019

In June i  started to complain of my urine bothering me. My concerns were dismissed and I fought a infection for over a year. During that year, I burned constantly, but have fought the burning urination.
It’s my skin burning.

I have no irritation or redness, no visible sores.  I do have puffiness in my Labia minora almost every single morning, burning in what I think is my Labia minora.  
I think the burning is triggered by urine hitting it.
If the area is touched, it doesn’t hurt but if I pee later after the area has been touched, it burns.
No doctor sees anything visually wrong with me.

My partner has no issues.

IF I had herpes, I don’t think I would have a constant issues with this, but it’s always sitting in the back of my mind.

If anyone experiences issue with burning only as a symptom, please let me know.",8,2022-03-17 08:57:00-04:00,"The igg results you had were very low positive & then negative , that would almost certainly mean the first 2 were false positive which a hsv2 result of under 3.5 has a very good probability of being. Was it hsv 2 you tested for ?

Herpes doesn’t cause constant OB / burning .  The BV couples with a yeast infection could. Or yeast due to taking antibiotics and not being treated , treated long enough or getting reinfected by your husband if he isn’t being treated at same time. I’ve had yeast without discharge , just burning itch & swelling. Oral med diflucan has worked best for me & topical for husband. Other things to investigate are  mycoplasma and ureaplasma . ### if your igg went down then i’d say you don’t have it. 

get tested for myco ### Exactly what I thought, but always in my mind.

What do you do you think of my time frame of results? Not exactly 90 days.
It was a blood test for HSV 1&2


I don’t have the itch for yeast , no redness either.  
I did try a “natural” yeast wash that was recommend by a naturopath and it made me burn more.    
Nobody has ever swabbed my vulvar skin. Nobody will listen, because they do not see anything.  They say nerves, but gabapentin and amitriptyline have not worked.

I have tried estrogen/testosterone too.

In 2020 right before the pandemic, I did a 2 week yeast culture and nothing grew.

I have also been check the plasmas.- negative 

I had BV, the followed by AV which took me a year to treat.
Nothing shows on my microgen ( vaginally)
I have had bad bacteria in my urine, which I stayed on macrobid for over a year.  Other than my burn, it has never felt like a infection.
Theburning does it get better and worse and I feel like it’s my skin.
Always better on my period.

It so frustrating. I have traveled to SEVEN states to see too doctors and it has been a joke.
I paid one out of pocket and she basically ignored me and told me to see Irwin Goldstein in California. ### I wish I could share results… ### I had it mixed up.  Those were my IGG numbers, there is a post below where I made the correction. ### The result was given together ?  Was it igg or igm? Should have separate results for both.  It’s horrible when gynos don’t listen to the patients. All i can recommend is keep trying to find one 😞.  And that antibiotics often cause yeast , but if it’s isn’t showing. up on tests🤷🏻‍♀️. Have you tried a yeast treatment and men often asymptomatic that’s why all my gynos & pharmacist said they have to get treated also. ### I’m giving the wrong info. 
IGM above (not IGG)  was 1.11, 1.26 and .76

The IGG for HSV1 was .07, <.010000, <.010000
The IGG for HSV2 was .08, .06, .06 ### No, I’m so scared to try anything, especially medication. My skin just feels so sensitive when I apply anything.

I can never receive a blowjob ever again. I want to die. ### If they have ghsv and are receiving oral it is possible but far less likely if it’s gHSV2 because that strain doesn’t like to live in the mouth. If it is ghsv1 then it is more possible to spread to the giver ### But for GHSV1, what if there was kissing involved in that original encounter? I have GHSV1 and wondering if I have it orally now too because of the kissing?
I really don’t want to give oral sex to someone and find out the hard way that I passed it to them 😕 ### Okay so regardless of whether they have GHSV1 or GHSV2, it can’t be spread to the other person from giving oral sex. That’s great to hear ### That’s my biggest fear… i’m sorry man. But theoretically, if you find someone who has herpes, you could still have blowjobs from them? ### Calm down. Oral sex is not the only reason u want live. By the way I too have Ghsv 1 ### No maybe my writing was confusing

Example. Girl has GHSV. She gives me a blowjob. Can I get herpes? ### But that is nearly impossible in the gay community. ### You don’t understand.

I do with my partner, and while not the same it’s still a way to give her oral ### Out of curiosity, why? Is there a science behind it? Personally i’m a straight guy, and one of the girls I was seeing has GHSV. I don’t often pull girls, so I was desperate and got head from her. I almost had sex with her but didn’t want without a condom even though I know you can still get it without a condom. Getting dates is already super hard for me, if I have HSV or get it down the road, I’d probably find it impossible to ever find anyone. Hope a vaccine comes asap. I hear 2030 ### Is it bias I have? Maybe? But I believe in general, its easier for women to find someone to have sex with them than it is for a man to find a woman willing to have sex with them. Just statistically, men are 50% more likely to not reproduce in their life than women are, because women are more selective. I know you’re gay, but I feel for you. It’s probably even harder to find a partner for you than it would be if you were straight ### Gotcha. Thanks ### It’s just reality. All the guys I talk to don’t have it.

tgaxlo,What’s your experience with using protection? So I’ve been dating a girl for a few months now. She disclosed to me that she was diagnosed with genital herpes about a year ago. We’re pretty into each other and we both want to take things to another level. She’s not on any medication. In your experience how effective are condoms? Thank you,18,2022-03-17 10:01:17-04:00,"I hate using condoms tbh. I caught herpes while using a condom. I think they protect females more then males. ### I'm 90% sure I caught it wearing a condom. I'm pretty like 96% effective for protection if the man is the one with herpes and like 60% protection if the woman has herpes. The good news is as the man you are wayy less likely to catch it from her even without the condom but the small risk is there and will always be there even if she uses medication ### I also caught it and was using protection. ### Caught it as a male wearing protection as well. GHSV-2. Condom didn’t break but I did give oral so could’ve transferred from that. ### It definitely helps if she’s not having an outbreak when y’all have protected sex…just saying… ### Female to male transmission is waaaaaayy lower than male to female transmission 

That said, there will be some small risk. I believe it's 2% chance of catching it for males from an infected female I'd you both have sex for twice a week for a year with the use of condoms, no antivirals and if she isn't having an outbreak. It's very low, only 1 higher than a girl on birth control getting pregnant (I think that's like 1% in a year)

I would recommend having a discussion with her about why she chose not to take antivirals and if she might consider taking them daily to reduce transmission risk to you down to 1% in an entire year. Antivirals will also reduce outbreaks in her (if she has any) which will lead to you being safer overall ### Like did something break?? ### i’m a female and caught it from a male even though he was wearing a condom. just depends on where you get your outbreaks i guess. i do believe female to male transmission is much lower though. again, depends on where she gets her outbreaks ### Wow.. was it because the condom broke? ### Man that’s disappointing. I so basically can’t do much sexually then ### Wanna add that I also caught GHSV2 from a man who didn't know his status/didn't tell me and therefore had sex with me while wearing a condom not realizing the razor burn on his balls was actually a herpes outbreak 

So naturally the condom didn't help one bit ### No. Caught it on the base of my dick. ### I don’t think where she gets her outbreaks matters. Unless you’re having an outbreak asymptomatic shedding happens everywhere where there is thin skin like the penis and the vagina. Not just where you get your outbreaks. ### No the condom did not break. Herpes got on the skin at the base of the penis where the condom does not cover. ### It really depends on your approach to ghsv. I’m currently (to my knowledge) negative with a partner who has gHSV2 and we have never used protection since we went from friends to dating and having sex. I love her and having it doesn’t matter to me because I was given a choice going into the relationship and I chose her

Edit: I can’t remember the exact numbers but using condoms does significantly reduce the chance of transmission. Even more so if your partner is on antivirals as well ### Thanks for your reply man 🙏🏽 ### Was it during an outbreak? ### Thank you ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tgaxlo/whats_your_experience_with_using_protection/
tfksqr,"Successful disclosure! (Mostly) So I (32m) just started hanging out with this girl I was insanely attracted to, both physically and personality wise.  We had a first date, hit it off, and she suggested we go back to my place. Now pre-diagnosis me would’ve tried to hook up immediately,(admittedly, I’m kind of a sex addict and generally tend to have toxic relationships that start with impulsive sex), but since I’ve been diagnosed, I’ve been trying to positively reframe it as a good excuse to take things slow and actually get to know someone instead of having a sexual connection right off the bat and clouding my judgement with whether or not I should date someone. 

We get to my place and she wanted to drink with me, but I told her I couldn’t as I was her ride home. She asked if it was cool if she stayed, and I told her it was fine, but we couldn’t have sex due to the reasons explained in the above paragraph. Obviously, this was a half truth, but I felt as though it wasn’t the worst lie to tell, as it gave us both the opportunity to get to know each other. She was actually super happy to oblige, much to my surprise.

Cut to three dates and way too much dry humping later. Sexual tension was off the chart on both sides, and I decided she was someone I really wanted a shot with and was well worth the potential risk to embarrass myself entirely by disclosing.

She had herpes as well. I thought she was fucking with me at first, until she listed off everything she knew about it. On top of that, her mother and a bunch of her friends have it as well, and hearing that made me feel a little less freakish. 

We didn’t end up working out sadly, but it proved to me that finding someone who’s either cool with it or a carrier themselves is not nearly  the statistically impossible feat I assumed it to be.

All the cases of ppl who claim genital autoinoculation with hsv-1 that I've been seeing on this sub have acquired it during adulthood. This makes me suspect that they could have acquired it in both locations at the same time more or less (4 months or so window) and were asymptomatic in one of them initially? 

Judging by some posts/comments here, autoinoculation seems more common than studies show it is, so I am wondering whether this is a selection effect or these are undiagnosed ""paralel"" infections. Or the studies understate autoinoculation stats.",0,2022-03-17 08:58:18-04:00,,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tg9nhn/is_there_any_case_of_someone_who_has_had_oral/

Or is it more likely this is an autoinoculation? 
I have had it in my lips ans sometimes it shows up in my nose, this is not autoinoculation right? More like the virus shedding in a different location?

Also, in general I'm very confused about autoinoculation. I have had HSV-1 since 3 years old but I have eczema on my hands and I bite my nails sometimes and I wear contact lenses, afraid I will be spreading it everywhere even though I read the chances are small.",14,2022-03-17 08:40:02-04:00,"Once hsv is established in the nerve ganglion it can breakout on skin anywhere around the nerve when it reactivates. Usually this is where the skin is thinnest as in the case with genital herpes where in men the penis shaft is the most likely place for it to breakout - but the nerve runs from the penis to the anus and so a genital infection can also outbreak on the anus and, less commonly, the perineum. The scrotum is much thicker and so is not a very likely place for the virus to shed or outbreak, despite it being in the genital region. I don't have a source to hand but this info is available on the westover heights forum with a quick search.

I believe oral hsv works the same way; the virus infects the trigeminal ganglia (Google for photos) which sits at the ear/cranium. There are nerves connected to this which run from this ganglia out to various parts of the face including the jaw, nose and the cornea of the eye. So feasibly, once the trigeminal ganglia is infected, when hsv reactivates it can run along any of these nerves and break out/shed on the skin around these nerves. This would include the nerve that runs to the eye and the nerve that runs to the nose. This is also linked to herpesvirus encephalitis, which is where a hsv infection reactivates in the brain (believed to travel there via the nerve). 

It is not common, but unfortunately it does happen and it doesn't have to be a new infection. ### I think the eye would be auto inoculation or reinfection .  The nose just a different OB location of same lip/ oral infection. ### Well, just found this:

""Thus, reactivations are usually in the same part of the body. Sometimes, reactivations of the virus occur in a different region, but are still supplied by the same nerve (for example patients with a history of cold sores around their lips get a reactivation in their eye).""

I later found this which seems to confirm what you wrote. 

""Thus, reactivations are usually in the same part of the body. Sometimes, reactivations of the virus occur in a different region, but are still supplied by the same nerve (for example patients with a history of cold sores around their lips get a reactivation in their eye).""

So the same infection that causes outbreaks on the lip can basically take a different path and show in your eye area. 

Apparently hsv-1 shedding in tears is very common as well according to this study: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309305089_Herpes_Simplex_Virus_Type_1_Shedding_in_Tears_and_Nasal_and_Oral_Mucosa_of_Healthy_Adults ### I thought it was the same infection. Read a study about viral shedding in tears, nasal and oral mucosa of hsv-1 (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309305089_Herpes_Simplex_Virus_Type_1_Shedding_in_Tears_and_Nasal_and_Oral_Mucosa_of_Healthy_Adults), got the impression it was the same infection shedding in different locations.

The nerve seems to be the same, but I am not sure? ### It seems I was right, oral herpes is more dangerous than people make it out to be:(

""Thus, reactivations are usually in the same part of the body. Sometimes, reactivations of the virus occur in a different region, but are still supplied by the same nerve (for example patients with a history of cold sores around their lips get a reactivation in their eye).""

Source: https://www.aao.org/eye-health/ask-ophthalmologist-q/how-easy-is-it-to-spread-genital-herpes-to-eyes ### Did you have it on your lips or nose or oral mucosa before?
Edit: I misread your comment, it seems you have it genitally. I only have it orally since I was a child but felt some tingling around my eye area some days ago and freaked out (took acyclovir immediately). ### Yes, because the virus enters through the skin - typically your lip (eg through a kiss) and travels up the nerve. The sensory nerves are the first to be infected but they are not the final ""home"" of the virus - the ganglion is. The ganglion is the ""main hub"" of the group of nerves. So basically everyone with oral herpes has the virus living latent (when not shedding and not breaking out) deep in the same nerve ganglion, then when it breaks out the virus picks a nerve to travel down so that it can reach the skin. So in short, everyone has oral hsv1 in the same nerve ganglion, but not everyone has outbreaks and shedding in the same place on their face. ### Sorry it would mean same hsv infection but not from the existing  the oral / nose infection  .  So if you have it in the oral area unless you infected your eye area you wouldn’t expect an outbreak in your eye. ### I have lots of friends & family with ohsv1 and none of them have ever contracted ocular herpes or had any OB in their eyes ### Yeah but according to the link I posted people with cold sores can get a reactivation in their eye. It seems to be rare but it nonetheless sucks bc the possibility is not 0. ### It's rare but it does happen. Typically people over 50.

It's the same virus they have always had, not a new one, it just decides for some reason to activate and travel up a different nerve, to break out in the eye. You do not need to be infected with hsv1 via the eye to have an ocular outbreak. ### Thats what I am saying. The only reason it activates in the eye is because there is a nerve that runs from the cornea down to the ganglion. If the eye were not connected by a nerve to the ganglion, reactivation could not happen in the eye. It is the same virus the person has already had, living in the same ganglion it already has, its just outbreaking via a different nerve.

And sadly, for some people it can do this but via nerve that connects from the ganglion to the brain and that's when herpesvirus encephalitis occurs (well at least this is what they believe is happening). Clive Wearing is a famous example of someone who ended up with herpesvirus encephalitis but I do not know the details of how exactly his occurred, I just know it did catastrophic damage to his brain. ### ",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tg9b4u/can_established_oral_hsv1_show_up_in_the_eyes_in/
tfyto8,"Dating Problems I (24F) have been dating my bf (25M) for a few months now and before we got sexually involved I disclosed to him that I had hsv 2. At first he was very shocked, but decided to give us a try. Fast forward we are happy and everything is great except for one thing. Our sex life is non-existent, at first there was no issue and then I started to notice the lack of foreplay and his need to be ultra clean all the time. These things didn’t bother me at first, slowly he wanted foreplay for himself but wouldn’t reciprocate. I confronted him about this which was very tough and he came clean and said that my diagnosis weighs heavily on his mind which is why he won’t do any foreplay. My sex drive is at it’s all time low because I feel dirty and not worthy. I don’t want this to be a deal breaker between us, but he’s not budging that much. He just thinks it’s a phase and that he’s fine to go without the physical aspect of our relationship. Any advice would be helpful. It just took me such a long time to stop feeling dirty for having hsv2 and still struggle here and there. I don’t know how to get through to him if I even can.",8,2022-03-16 21:40:03-04:00,"Dump him. He has reservations and there are plenty of men who won't. He's hurting your self esteem and emotional health. ### You need to just tell him like either he accepts you and the risk or he doesn't. This sounds not fun at all. Maybe he doesn't care about the physical aspect but that doesn't mean you need to not care. I'm sorry that this is making you feel dirty but I think you need to just find someone else. ### You aren't dirty, 1in 5 women have it...and they estimate 80% of the population potentially has it!

I think its more damaging for your mental health to be in a relationship with someone who truly doesn't accept you to be honest with you. Clearly his aversion to things that you need for your pleasure is a big deal and something he may never get over. 

You are young and don't need to give up things that YOU enjoy because you have a very common virus. ### This is selfish on his part.
You deserve so much better.❤️ ### This is selfish. He should have been open and communicated his concerns to you. At least then you could have discussed dental dams or finger condoms. The way he chose to go about it was hurtful and mean. ### It’s selfish of him. I get having to come to terms with it and needing time, but you deserve someone that actually wants to please you without being scared - and you can find that.
I was dating someone that didn’t care at all and it didn’t affect our sex life, even though he didn’t want it for himself. But as he said - if he gets it, he gets it, and it could might as well has been from someone else. 
This is your BOYFRIEND. He shouldn’t be scared to touch you. ### I’m in the same boat as your boyfriend. If he truly loves you, he will eventually open up. It takes time to open up for others. Its taking time for me too but I know I love her and working to improve and educate myself that’s why I’m here. ### I was in this situation and it did not end well. He tried to be accepting but in end never was and it’s now made the acceptance of it a lot harder and really affected my mental health when things ended a year later.

I have been diagnosed for 10 years and have had  20+ partners since diagnosis. None of them to their knowledge have genital herpes some had cold sores. I am currently with a guy who is completely HSV negative he works at a blood lab and took a test just for shits and giggles.  He knows about my herpes I disclosed and he is completely fine with it and accepts the risks. There are plenty of people like this who do not care. Sitting around and waiting for a cure it’s silly you’re rejecting yourself before anyone even has a chance to think about it or reject you or accept you. You are putting limits on yourself before giving anyone else the opportunity to consider anything. People get rejected every day for a plethora of different reasons Sure there are people who ghosted me especially on tinder but as I talked to my friends I realized they got ghosted too and it wasn’t because of herpes it was because dating apps are cesspools in general. Dating nowadays sucks for so many reasons if you want to pin it on herpes go for it but that’s not the only reason. I was diagnosed with ghsv-1 at 19 and I thought my life was over I didn’t tell a soul cut off friends and everything because I felt so disgusting and gross. But eventually I put myself out there and had a few positive disclosure s and i began to realize that I was the one creating the stigma for myself.. The more people I told the less it weighted me down. Think of it logically friends should care because it doesn’t effect them. The only people your herpes effects are the people you are sleeping With. Friends are supposed to be your support system and if you tell them your story they should not judge you And they will learn from you And your experience. Hell you May even help a fellow herpes person out becuase if someone discloses to your friend after you teach them about herpes they will be more understanding and knowledgeable about it.

Please reach out if you need anything!! I promise it gets better! ### literally me. got it at 18 and i will randomly cry in the middle of the bar or class it fucking sucks ### Sending you a bunch of love. I (28F) was diagnosed last month. I have my really bad days, usually after I’ve realized I’m purposely trying to forget about the diagnosis. And other days are okay because i realize it’s not as bad as society makes it out to be. But I feel you. I had a huge crying sesh randomly at 6am today. I needed it, I’m still struggling to accept, but I know I’ll be okay. We’ll both be okay. Hope you feel better, everything will be okay over time. ### I know it’s still new for you and you’re probably running the gamut of convincing yourself you’re “unlovable,” but I’m several years out and it just isn’t the case. I’ve told a *lot* of people and a handful of potential partners about my diagnosis and absolutely no one has cared. The hardest critic is going to be yourself. You’re just one of many who is living with this, but you’re lucky to be one who knows about it. Stop the negative self-talk—you didn’t choose this, so why beat yourself up?

The best thing you can do for yourself is learn how to contain outbreaks, practice prophylaxis—arm yourself with information. There are ways to be safe, but still have fun. Soon this will just be another thing to know about yourself, like having allergies.

You’re a bad bitch and it’s going to take a lot more than this to bring you down. ### From ob relayed pain or the stigma? ### I promise it is only a big deal in your head. Most people do not care, in my experience. Chin up and maybe look into therapy if these thoughts continue. ### What part of the diagnosis is the worst for you? Do you have constant symptoms? Or is it just the mental and emotional aspect of \*knowing\* you have herpes?

This might be an unpopular opinion and I'm in no way trying to invalidate your feelings or your experience. That being said:

We have been taught as a society that STDs/Is are worse than any other viral or bacterial infections. This probably stems from organized religion and the idea of ""purity"" behind sex for better or for worse. But really, you're already a host to millions of bacteria and foreign microscopic organisms that you don't even think about. They've been living inside you since you were born, or even before. But you don't think about this as a bad thing because, even though we're taught this in high school biology/anatomy, we're not taught that it's scary or bad. In even the most progressive sex ed classes around the world, STDs are taught to be seen as scary and bad. But really, like almost any other illness (which you could easily have now without even knowing) it's only scary if left untreated or in severe cases. 

Don't get me wrong, herpes isn't fun by any means, but neither is any other sickness you might have. I've had herpes now for two years. I let the idea of it control my life for a few months, but soon realized that it was only different because of the way I was thinking. I had very few symptoms, and of the people with herpes I've talked to, a minority deal with regular symptoms for long, and transmission really isn't that common (again, just speaking from my experience). ### I’ve been feeling this exact same way. I’ve been in severe mental distraught. This way I’m suffering from this is so unbelievable I constantly try to ignore it and act like I’m okay but I just cannot. I’m not sure if my depression is due to the way I acquired it, or if it’s due to all the physical pain & symptoms I’ve been having for months, or if it’s due to my uncertainty for the future. I’m convinced depression is a symptom on having herpes. I’m really trying to be okay like everyone else seems to be. ### I’m a man that will never get oral again.. makes my dreams vague lol, but it’s something I’ve learned to deal with.. ### What?!? With HSV1!?! Maybe you should read about HSV2?!? And how terrifying this virus is for a lot of us… ### If you are affected this much, please get therapy. 

Crying every day, disassociation, etc., are all signs that you need some therapy. It doesn't matter if it's herpes or a bad break up or losing a job or what - it's just time for some therapy. 

Take care of you. ❤️ ### I know everyone is different but I’ve had GHSV1 for 20 years and have only had 2 outbreaks in that time (without daily antivirals). I’ve had successful relationships, (they were fine with the fact that I have it) I was with my ex for 12 years, we had unprotected sex pretty much that whole time and he never contracted it. I was recently in a 4 month relationship, again regular unprotected and he didn’t contract it. I’m not encouraging you to do this, obviously everyone needs informed consent, but the chances of you passing on GHSV1 through P/V sex is actually very unlikely, and typically people with GHSV1 have much fewer breakouts than HSV2 (this is because HSV1 prefers the mouth, HSV2 prefers the genitals). You can even take daily antivirals to help ease your mind. But just know that this isn’t the end of the world, HSV is VERY common, more people have it than you know! And I promise you that you’ll be able to lead a very happy and normal life 😊 
I suggest you watch this, very informative and will make you feel much better I’m sure! https://youtu.be/YntUMzrvefw ### The stigma I guess ### Why wouldn’t you? ### I understand that the two strains are different from each other but hsv is hsv. I’m not going to compare myself or my experience to those with hsv2 because the mental/physical impact this virus has on people is subjective to the person. They both suck. ### Hey ! After your first outbreak was sex painful or did it feel different at all? This might be tmi and you can choose not to answer, but I’m curious because I’m currently struggling. ### Let that dark cloud go to enjoy your life again ### How much direct stigma, from people you care about or who you want to date/sleep with, have you faced? ### Hey sorry that you’re struggling. 😔 No it wasn’t painful nor did it feel different but I had only had sex twice before I transmitted hsv1 so I don’t have much to compare to. I do get sore after two much friction but that usually settles after a day or so, and I’m not sure if it’s due to hsv1 or if I’m just sensitive. ### Also, after my second outbreak (which I only had in Jan this year) my skin has been pretty sensitive down there since, it’s slowly getting back to normal now though. Have you experienced this? Sex still feels the same though. ### Im currently still going through my first, or at least I’m guessing. I thought I was all healed up but when I tried to have sex it felt like something was tearing down there. I’m assuming my skin is just really sensitive still as a result, I am hoping it gets better as time passes. I did have plenty of itching a week ago tho there were no sores present, but that went away. I’ve been dealing with this outbreak for over a month now. ### I think the skin can stay very sensitive for a while after, are you on daily antivirals? I hope you feel better soon, it just takes some ### ",16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tfoqkq/ugh/
tg2jcw,"Legal advice Hi all. This may sound absurd, I understand if it does. However I’m at my wits end. I was diagnosed with GHSV1 in December of 2020. It took an extreme toll on my mental health, to a level I can’t describe, as I’m sure others here also went through. Long story short, two people I   was close friends with at the time of my diagnosis whom I shared it with I am no longer friends with. Since May of 2021, they have posted a public video on social media disclosing my diagnosis & making fun of it, saw me at a hometown bar this summer and decided to tell everyone we went to high school with who also were at the bar that night (there were many people, especially those I knew) for no reason. I had no contact with them at ALL that night, and walked far away any time they were near me. Not one word was exchanged between us. Tonight, they’ve once again posted it on social media. All of this has been done in a malicious / cyber bullying intention and I’m incredibly tired of this. I have not spoken to any of these people since May of 2021 and for whatever reason this has continued. I literally moved to the opposite end of the country in July 2021 and it is still continuing. Surprisingly, I’m quite unbothered with this happening again in the sense that I don’t feel the need to confront like I normally would. I feel that the only people who look pathetic in this situation are the two who are stooping low enough to spread personal information regarding herpes. However, I’ve had enough of this and am tired of hearing that they’re continuing this. Normally I wouldn’t take much or any action in this situation, however I’m tired of this happening & worry about how this has continued and potentially will continue to worsen my mental health. I am wondering if there is ANY sort of legal action that can be taken, even a civil lawsuit. I know it sounds absurd. I know I should not let this effect me and I am trying my hardest and at the same time it’s not right that this is happening and I want to be left alone. I know defamation and libel are not an option because this is true information, but if there’s ANYTHING I can do, please let me know, even if it’s a stretch and there’s slim chances of it going anywhere.

Document everything. 

I'm so sorry.

tg55by,"So I have HSV-1 (oral herpes) and have had it for the longest time. Just checking about these do nots? Probably got it from my mom or something when I was younger, I am 39. Flares up only when I am stressed. Managing ok with it generally. 

However as a responsible individual, I Googled and am also asking here about the do-nots, which I think are :

a) No kissing allowed? (I didn't kiss my last gf because of my condition)

b) No oral sex? 

c) No sharing of utensils or food? (I actually share food on a semi-regular basis with quite a lot of people, maybe I should not have been doing that?)

d) No unprotected PIV sex?

From what I have read, it's the most contagious during an outbreak, but also can be spread without one?

Just want to be informed and lead a healthy life.",2,2022-03-17 04:09:02-04:00,"Right yes you are contagious even not during an outbreak because you could be shedding. If you have frequent outbreaks you should consider going on antivirals. 

You can still kiss people. Most people you've ever kissed probably had ohsv1. 70% of people have it orally bur 80% of those people never have any outbreaks. So they don't know they have it ;). You also can't pass to them if they have it already. 

Oral well yeah so you can pass it on to them genitally if you give them oral and it's harder to protect them if it's oral and they're a woman. You can once again go on antivirals to give higher chances that you won't pass anything to them. If you happen to find someone who has it genitally even type 2 you can't give them herpes genitally again :) so oral becomes easier. 

You can still perform oral because chances of them getting type 1 genitally is lower and plus yes you can help it by 1) antivirals  and 2) don't go down on them if you have an outbreak of pre outbreak symptoms. Same goes for kissing ofc.


It is highly unlikely to pass on herpes by sharing food or other things because the virus passes on skin to skin contact but we've heard some stories apparently. I'd say to be sure don't do that during an outbreak but any other day you should be fine as it technically shouldn't pass on this way.

You have oral herpes, right? Why would that change anything for PIV sex? Your lips aren't on your dick :) 

If you have genital herpes then it'd be better to use condoms and maybe antivirals if that's something you don't mind. Women have higher chances of getting it genitally due to our vaginas. I don't see how you could get genital herpes from your mum however so I'm assuming you have it orally. ### It's oral, but I was asking in general.

Also it's just basic informed consent dude. ### This is wild—my doctors have always told me I should disclose in all situations—in fact they stress it. 

It’s something I hear repeatedly from nurses and doctors. 

And I’ve worked in sex-education and harm reduction and most people in the field agree that disclosure is both good public health policy and a good consent practice.

(I think the medical reason is that it’s important for public health reasons—to reduce transmission rates of the virus) ### I wish I had your doctors lol. Was anyone else told this? My friends told me to do this but I still feel guilty, but if certain doctors are saying this then 🤷 ### The diagnosing nurse told me I don't have to disclose which made me feel better but also made me mad.

That definitely sounds like a non consensual situation! :( ### Well, that sounds like... ### I can see it. It's not like it affects you constantly. I ""forget"" I have herpes in regular life. ### Fair point but why would all those professionals tell me I shouldn’t? They all told me that it would ruin my sex life. If I disclose it on any sort of occasion, it just means that I will have to deal with it constantly just for that tiny chance of transmission.. I feel like this disease is unbearable if i’d even have to tell a girl on a random night out. ### Strange, my doctors only told me to not disclose it if I don’t have any symptoms & i’m using a condom. ### Totally get that. Maybe where im from the vision is just different (the Netherlands). Literally every doctor and institution I have spoken to (probably 5 or 6 professionals) gave me the advice to NOT disclose it to hookups or random sexual encounters because it’ll ruin my sex life for the tiny chance of infecting someone (with condom & no outbreak). They told me to only disclose it when I am dating someone in a serious way and frequently have sex with this person. ### Ignore your friends, always disclose. ### I've heard a lot of doctors say that. Morally you should tell them. It is however your decision at the end of the day. You're kinda trying to like ""save"" yourself by not discosing but you'd feel much better about it later because people would still accept you. It'd make you feel better about diagnosis too. Sure it might not be everyone but that's also their decision at the end of the day. You'd rather have them chose to take the risk rather than put them at risk without their consent. Once again it is for you to chose what to do. 

Doctors only say that because of how many people feel shitty about it and also how common it is. Doesn't mean they're telling you to do the best thing. ### I’ve been told to not disclose to random hookups by every doctor I spoke with, still feels weird and i still don’t know what to do since i’ve had it for only a week now (gonna get my result today but I’m already certain of it). For the disclosing, it feels better to listen to all of those doctors than people who aren’t doctors, so if I do get confirmed today, im just gonna go with that I guess. ### I feel like its immoral too, for myself i’d tell a girl if its getting more serious and we’re having sex on a regular basis. I just don’t know if i’d tell every single girl that I hook up with on a drunk night out/a casual one time thing because it’ll just ruin me mentally. For those occasions i’ll just stick to a condom & no outbreak, apparently that gives transmission only a 1% chance, thats probably why all of my (Dutch) doctors say that I shouldn’t disclose it to random hookups. ### Already sent the text lol but I appreciate it I hope she still wants to see me again 🙏 ### Yeah honestly I feel dumb af but I did truly forget as I did not plan on having sex that night ### I literally forget all the time unless i hear the word which is rare, or if I have an ob ### [deleted] ### [deleted] ### So you’re telling me that all those professionals are wrong and I should listen to you instead? I would rather risk that 1% of transmission than having to disclose it to every single girl i have 1 hookup with.. I’m a 20 year old student and I will definitely be very cautious but I feel like disclosing it to everybody is just self sabotaging & depressing right now. Probably one of the reasons why all of the professionals I spoke to told me not to disclose it to every girl i meet. ### Its okay, I appreciate any kind of feedback. I’ll always be able to look at myself in the mirror, no matter what decision I take from now on. And yeah it’s really hard to deal with, I’m still in denial actually. Seems like this disease has a very subjective way of dealing with it, I completely understand that there are people who disclose it in every situation, but i’m keen on following the advice of several doctors by not disclosing it to literally everyone and by being as safe as possible. It’s a risk i’m willing to take, either way i’ll go now, it doesn’t matter which way I go, both ways just suck and i’ll have to accept that until I find a wife when i’m older. ### [deleted] ### Ahh, im from the Netherlands and everybody here keeps it a secret, so the stigma must be pretty bad. I still haven’t even gotten my official result but I am already certain of it.. I’m sad to hear that u got rejected because of this shit, exactly why I only wanna disclose to a girl I wanna be serious with and not just some random hookup. :( ### [deleted] ### Fair, I (probably) also got it from a hookup who told me she never showed any kinds of symptoms and had her first outbreak after that, no idea if she’s lying tho, but we did it without protection which i’m definitely not planning to do. I feel like she didn’t know because then it’d be a weird action of her to not even suggest protection. I don’t think it will be negative since I have no idea what else it could be - but the only symptom I have is a sore on the tip of my penis which only hurts a lot when its touched or whenever I pee. The doctor gave me antiviral meds to cease it, and I guess it’s kinda getting less after 3 days. The girl however had a fever and a lotta pain. I really hope your test will be negative tho, that would be amazing. ### [deleted] ### I respect your point of view a lot, hopefully I can think like that some day. It’s just the fact that i’m 20 makes it all worse for me, honestly would’ve cared so much less if I was like 40 or whatever. I’ll still follow my doctors advice for now but i’ll definitely think about what u told me today!

tfng4w,"Emotions all over the place I was just diagnosed with gHSV2 yesterday via PCR swab. I only have one ulcer on the side of my clitoral hood. It's annoying and painful but it could be worse (I hope it doesn't get worse)
When my husband and I first started dating, he disclosed his herpes diagnosis. We weren't sexually active until we got married last September. So I've always known it was a risk and we found that using protection interfered with our feelings of intimacy. 
I've known I'd get it at some point. But now that I actually have it.. I'm feeling so hopeless. Logically, I know that eventually it'll be no big deal and that it doesn't change who I am or anything.. but I'm so depressed and angry. My emotions are all over the place. I'm trying so hard to not take it out on my husband, because I knew the risks. I already know I'm going to be with him the rest of my life, so I probably won't have to deal with disclosure before sexual contact ever. 
But I'm spiraling, and no amount of logic or common sense is making it stop. 
I have a friend that's very open about her herpes and her experience so I'm planning on meeting up with her for lunch this week to talk. I'm doing everything I can to get support through this because I struggle with self harm when I feel out of control and I want to get through this without hurting myself. 
Thanks for reading my word vomit 🤍",8,2022-03-16 13:32:47-04:00,"Hey I understand the depression I was depressed for years until I finally decided enough was enough. I have been diagnosed for 10 years and have had  20+ partners since diagnosis. None of them to their knowledge have genital herpes some had cold sores. I am currently with a guy who is completely HSV negative he works at a blood lab and took a test just for shits and giggles.  He knows about my herpes I disclosed and he is completely fine with it and accepts the risks. There are plenty of people like this who do not care. Sitting around and waiting for a cure it’s silly you’re rejecting yourself before anyone even has a chance to think about it or reject you or accept you. You are putting limits on yourself before giving anyone else the opportunity to consider anything. People get rejected every day for a plethora of different reasons Sure there are people who ghosted me especially on tinder but as I talked to my friends I realized they got ghosted too and it wasn’t because of herpes it was because dating apps are cesspools in general. Dating nowadays sucks for so many reasons if you want to pin it on herpes go for it but that’s not the only reason. I was diagnosed with ghsv-1 at 19 and I thought my life was over I didn’t tell a soul cut off friends and everything because I felt so disgusting and gross. But eventually I put myself out there and had a few positive disclosure s and i began to realize that I was the one creating the stigma for myself.. The more people I told the less it weighted me down. Think of it logically friends should care because it doesn’t effect them. The only people your herpes effects are the people you are sleeping With. Friends are supposed to be your support system and if you tell them your story they should not judge you And they will learn from you And your experience. Hell you May even help a fellow herpes person out becuase if someone discloses to your friend after you teach them about herpes they will be more understanding and knowledgeable about it.

Please reach out if you need anything!! I promise it gets better ### I’m starting to feel like depression is a symptom of herpes. The way i try to control my deep sadness & anger all the time. I truly wish I was just perfectly mentally okay but I had to seek serious help with multiple therapists and counselors. I’m unsure if it’s the situation of how I got it that has me like this, or just the herpes condition itself. I heard it just takes time & it’ll get better so that’s what I’m hoping for the both of us. Sorry you have to go through this ### I had similar feelings when I first got diagnosed. I have HSV-2, but somehow orally (which is apparently becoming more common). At first, I was worried and hated that I had an incurable STI, but then I realized it really isn't a big deal, literally over 60% of sexually active adults have it and if you take medication, it will have close to no impact on your life. I take Valtrex daily to prevent outbreaks and haven't had any since my first outbreak and diagnoses. It's something I don't even think about anymore. When you realize that so many people have it (with most not even knowing they do), it starts to ease your mind; at least it did for me. ### If you love your husband and plan on being with him for the rest of your life, then there is nothing to worry about. Sounds like you have a pretty mild initial outbreak. The first is ALWAYS the worst; I got meningitis in my first outbreak, in part because I don't have HSV1 (if you acquire HSV2 after already having HSV1 you're much more likely to have a less severe first breakout or be asymptomatic).

The outbreaks will eventually stop with antivirals and you will be as if you don't even have it. Really, after that, the only issues come with disclosure to new partners; that is by and large the hardest part and I am currently 6/6 in disclosures as a 29M. In your case, again, that shouldn't be an issue. I am currently starting a romantic relationship with a 28F who is HSV negative. After four outbreaks (the next three after the initial one were incredibly mild) I am asymptomatic. You'll make it and you will still be able to have kids, if that's something you want.

Now that you both have it, you all will soon be free to engage in sexual activities without worrying all that much. Just wait a few months for the antibodies to build for oral so you don't get it there as well. ### I just want to say that you are absolutely wonderful for accepting your husband with HSV. And that as long as you are happy with him the diagnosis shouldn’t matter. It’s the big stigma against having herpes down below that gets everyone all over the place. I would recommend seeing a doctor and possibly getting on some kind of anxiety and depressive meds. I take Lorazepam 20mg a day to help with depression and anxiety. I was diagnosed in September with HSV 1. And it tore me apart. I truly understand what you are going through. Especially because I am not married and I do disclose to people. I recently started seeing a therapist that has really helped to keep my mind clear. Do not feel shame for contracting this, because if we take out all the bs it’s no different then a skin infection. Look at it as like getting acne or having break outs once in a while. But no one can see them. The only ones that will know are you and your husband. Stay strong, outside of the two of you no one has to know. It’s up to you when and who you tell. Otherwise it doesn’t change who you are at all. ❤️ ### All the numbers in your comment added up to 69.

tfk6do,"Almost constant hsv2 symptoms. Hi all, 

I’ve had HSV2 (genital) for around 20 years. I take 1600mg of acyclovir a day, 1000mg of lysine and use lomoherpan as and when. 
My actual outbreaks aren’t too common, probably 5 or less a year. However, I go through periods of experiencing prodromes for months on end. My labia feel sore all the time, as though grazed, although there’s nothing visible. I can also feel pain and pressure there, as well as nerve pain in the back of my leg. 
I’m generally very healthy (I haven’t even had a cold for years). 
Doctors either don’t believe me, don’t know what the issue is or just aren’t interested. Goes without saying that it ruins my sex life because I’m super cautious about passing it on. I also contracted the virus through a r*pe as a child so symptoms are very triggering at times. 
Is anyone like me? Does anyone have any information or advice for me in terms of how to better control it? 
Thank you.
Edit: thank you so much for everyone taking the time to comment. It seems the issue is thrush, so not herpes related although super similar. Such a relief that I can actually cure it. I’m really sad that doctors hadn’t spotted this and I guess it’s so important for them (and us) to remember that herpes won’t be our only gynaecological issue.",16,2022-03-16 11:26:44-04:00,"1600mg is way too much a day. ### I've had hsv2 for almost 20 years, and whenever I get symptoms like this, I have bacterial vaginosis. 

Also, prodrome means warning sign, essentially, and would last a day, tops, so what you are experiencing isn't prodrome if you aren't getting outbreaks. Some people get nerve pain from the antivirals and you are on a hell of a dose. The dose for suppression is 800 mg twice a day - maybe cut it back? 

Maybe get tested for yeast and BV, and see if you have either of those first, and then cut back on your dose of acyclovir. It's an awful lot. :( 

The other thing is that maybe you have a pinched nerve or something - something totally unrelated to herpes. 

I hope you find some relief soon. ❤️ ### Oh man, I just posted something really similar about 20 minutes ago. I'm so sorry, I don't have any suggestions but so, so much empathy for you. I'm in the same situation. I have been having severe symptoms at least 2 weeks every month, often it just runs together because it starts the week before my period, and takes a week or two after to heal. The sores are the least of it, the raw, achy skin and nerve pain is unbearable. 
And I just talked to a new doctor this morning who completely blew me off. I'm so hurt, ashamed, tired and hopeless. Everyone says it's not a big deal, but apparently, sometimes it is! I can't imagine giving this to someone else, knowing how debilitating it is. I don't understand why there's so little to be done about it. 

 I'm so sorry you feel the same. ### Switch to low carb diet and figure out the food that are inflammatory to you. Most of the times you think only medicine can heal but it’s also your state of immune system ### I was also going to ask. I was diagnosed a year ago with oral genital  hsv and this morning after my shower I started to feel itchy. It’s red but I don’t see the knife like cut or any sores. Is this a prodrome? It hurts like crazy and I can’t focus ag work. I ordered the acyclovir and will start taking it today. Ugh I was hoping I’d be one of the lucky ones to never get an outbreak again :((( ### I think you should try cutting out the drugs completely and see if it gets better. That's too high a  dose and I think you need to give your body a chance to see if it can fight it. ### Hi, 

Thank you so much for your answer. I’ve actually wondered if it was BV before and kept testing but I’ve never had a positive test. 
It’s really interesting that people are saying my dosage is too high. It was prescribed by my doctor and I’ve been on a similar dose on and off before. Will need to discuss it I think. ### Should also mention the symptoms are always in the exact spot I get outbreaks. Seems to be a mystery. ### Sending love. I hope you find an answer too ❤️ I don’t feel like doctors understand it at all. ### Good idea! Thank you ### Hi, 

Thanks for your response. I only started taking them again a few months ago following a long break. I didn’t take them for a couple of years but had the same issue. ### [removed] ### Look up a book called cleanse to heal by medical medium on Amazon, it has supplements that can help detox you ### I'm sorry. That sucks. ### Comment removed. You appear to be projecting some personal issues into the discussion in a manner that is not warranted. One of the major issues here is whether OP's symptoms are even herpes related in the first place.

You also appear to be confusing acyclovir dosing for an active outbreak vs for daily suppression.

>You can have false negatives until about 90 days post exposure, be warned.

False negatives can occur at the 12-week mark and beyond as well. They are less likely at that point, but can still occur, and the rate is still substantial.

>It’s a lot easier to diagnose you if you’re having an OB, because they can confirm visually and swab them.

I think meant to say *inspected* visually and *tested* or *confirmed* via swab? Because herpes should never be *confirmed* based on visual inspection alone.

tfvpvv,"Test Report Came Out So this doctor told me I have herpes after looking at my penis (Which I was thinking is a bacterial infection of some sort), and suggested me some tests from a lab that he ""suggested"". The reports are given below, cost me a good chunk of money, I have a follow up consultation with this doctor on Saturday and I am starting to doubt him because Can he be all business and just wanted to make some money through commission from tests and all because people do that here for Business as I have heard.  Test results are negative I think? So please share your output on that as well. 

My test results

IgG - 0.72 ( normal range 0.8-1.2)
IgM- 0.49 ( normal range 0.8-1.2)


CRP - 1.10mg/l 

My gf also got tested for some just to be careful

IgG- 0.76
IgM-0.64

CRP- 2.84mg/l",12,2022-03-16 19:02:50-04:00,"It’s negative. IGm is unreliable. Either you probably tested to soon or are truly negative. Get tested again in 12 weeks! ### I was facing these symptoms for more than one and half months tho, so I am sure test was not very soon and symptoms are clearing up fast now. So should I really go for a test again? And should I consult the same doctor? ### Maybe go to the consultation and see what he has to say. And if you do decide to retest - now or later - do so with a different doctor. Maybe even consider switching your primary to not be him… ### Did he swab your OB ?  Herpes OB don’t last a continuous month & half.  Reason why person said you may have tested too soon with Igg is , if it’s a new infection it can take up to 12 weeks for antibodies to show up positive in blood test. Igm not a useful test .  

Also you didn’t mention which hsv antibody you tested for ?  Hsv 1 or 2. Should be listed as 2 separate results.

And cpr?? Do you mean pcr of an OB ?  Was your GF having an active OB too ? ### The doctor didn't clarify but I checked the report it says for hsv 1 and 2 both, (hsv 1 and 2 igG) and no there was no Outbreaks in any of us. My gf and me. My gf has/had no symptoms, where as I had somewhat of a fungal infection case on my penis and as I have seen in photos, it didn't look like a herpes outbreak. 

And this infection was going on for about more than 2 months in total, or maybe even more because of my ignorance so if it was herpes I'm thinking igG would have been positive

Also the doctor directly stated you have herpes and then asked me questions like when did you have sex last time and did it go worse after sex and I told him it started to get worse like 14 days ago and still he suggested igG , which makes me think it's all fishy

Also he suggested a crp test which is C- reactive protein test and idk how that is related to this situation. ### Also he didn't swab outbreak, he just looked at my penis and told me it's herpes. ### If you had no OB I am puzzled to as why or how he diagnosed the hsv .  Did he or you treat the fungal ?  I know you can buy otc cream & you should see results in a couple days. With fungal I’m surprised your GF hasn’t been infected. ### Visual diagnoses in lieu of actual swab is sloppy. And also will not identify the strain hsv1 or 2. Did he give you anything to try and clear it up ?  Are you still having symptoms? ### That's what I am confused about. ### He gave me one ointment and one cream, it's working, whatever it was is clearing up now ### No antiviral oral med ? What did he give you to clear it up ? ### Hi, sorry for catching up late on this, so he gave me a couple pills for infection and inflammation, and one ointment and a some cream to apply on the area. 

And follow up on the doc - i consulted him once again to see what all he is about and I was actually asking him if there's a chance it's not herpes since my and my gf's test both are negative, and there are very less chances of us getting herpes and there are no symptoms as well, and he sort of lost his shit for a moment and said - "" the blood test is negative , doesn't mean it's not herpes , It is herpes and ther virus can still be there and there would be no symptoms at all"" (i guess he got offended that I am questioning his diagnosis) .

But I mean what other confirmation do I need apart from blood test , because it could be that I am negative atm , if it's too soon or anything (which is not because I calculated everything) and even my gf is negative and that cannot be a coincidence, that's what I am thinking and, the doc is just trying to make his $$ and giving me dates for follow up consultation, ps- he suggested me another followup after 10 days, although my infection is 90% gone from the skin . ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tfvpvv/test_report_came_out/
tfmj8f,"Increased outbreaks after covid vaccine? Hi all! I am by no means trying to start a pro-vax/anti-vax debate here. I'm just curious if anyone else has had an increase in outbreaks since getting the covid vaccine?

Previously I was just getting one per year if I wasn't taking daily Valtrex, and I NEVER got an outbreak while taking it. Not much else about my life has changed; in fact, I've moved out of a big city and quit my stressful job so I feel like it wouldn't be additional stress causing it.

tfvb2o,"Waiting for intimacy with HSV2 exposed partner? I (f) have recently started seeing an amazing person (m) who I'd like to be intimate with soon. He has disclosed to me that he recently had unprotected PIV sex with someone (f) who is HSV2 positive - the last time being a month ago.

Apparently she hadn't had a symptomatic flare / episode for the past six months so he assumed the chance of transmission would be very low. However based on my reading it seems there may be a \~10% chance of transmission to him in this case. I would like to avoid potential transmission to myself if at all possible.

I'm wondering what the best way forward is to inform and protect myself? Some options I'm thinking through below - all thoughts / advice most welcome!

\- Gather more info about his likely exposure e.g. how many times they had unprotected sex, how long she has been living with HSV2, whether she takes any antiviral meds, how frequently she experiences symptomatic flares / episodes?

\- Refrain from all genital contact and PIV sex with him until 12 weeks have passed since the last exposure (i.e. \~8 weeks from now) and he can take an IGG test to see whether he's contracted HSV2?

\- Invite him to take an IGG test now (\~30 days after the last exposure so not ideal as I understand it should be 12+ weeks for most accurate results), only engage in condom-protected genital contact and PIV sex with him until 12 weeks have passed since the last exposure, then he can get another hopefully more conclusive IGG test?

\*I don't believe he's been exposed to HSV2 via past sexual partners or at least has never had any symptoms. He also doesn't have any symptoms of HSV2 now. 

To be clear I'm into him and would like to engage in intimacy just feel it would be good to know his HSV2 status first (which likely isn't possible for sure for another \~8 weeks...) and be able to take some protective measures like condom use and antiviral meds on his part if it turns out he is now HSV2 positive.",14,2022-03-16 18:44:13-04:00,"Are you saying your partner had a *single* sexual encounter with a woman who has hsv2? If so, the likelihood he got infected would be considerably *less* than 10%, and that's *especially* so when he hasn't experienced any symptoms suggestive of herpes.

Here are the female-to-male transmission stats for genital hsv2 within the constraints stated:

---

**Female-to-Male Ghsv2 transmission risk:**

If the situation is reversed and it's the woman who has genital hsv2 and the man doesn't and they both know she has it, if they have unprotected sex for an entire year (approximately twice per week) except during outbreaks and the woman takes no herpes medication, the man has a 4% chance of becoming infected by the end of the year.

To reiterate: having sex more or less often than twice per week would raise or lower that base figure accordingly. And that base figure comes from studies of couples already in long term relationships, and herpes is slightly more likely to transmit when the partners have been together less than 3 months, or when the infection is still fairly recent (eg first six months etc).

Condom use and herpes medication would each lower the female-to-male transmission risk by about 50% further from whatever it was before. So if the couple uses condoms *or* the woman takes medication, the annual risk to the man comes down to about 2%. And if they use both, it comes down to about 1%. As you can see, men are at considerably less risk of catching herpes than women when no condoms are used. But men also gain considerably less protection from condoms than do women.

---

So. It sounds like your partner wasn't in a long term relationship with that woman, so the risk may have been slightly higher than that stated above. But that should still give you a general sense of things.

>I'm wondering what the best way forward is to inform and protect myself?

I would suggest you consider the degree of likelihood he caught it, and then decide whether that would warrant your using condoms. Condoms provide women with a very high level of protection from herpes, though not quite complete.

>Invite him to take an IGG test now (~30 days after the last exposure so not ideal as I understand it should be 12+ weeks for most accurate results), only engage in condom-protected genital contact and PIV sex with him until 12 weeks have passed since the last exposure, then he can get another hopefully more conclusive IGG test?

Unless he had a considerable number of sexual encounters with the woman in question, I personally don't think that testing would be warranted in terms of that particular woman at least. If you're concerned about his status more generally then you could certainly ask him to get tested. And in that situation, it would likely be appropriate for you to get tested also. Genital hsv2 is fairly common, and a full 80% of the people who have it *don't know they have it*. ### That’s very responsible of him to disclose that information to you. I would just wait the 12 weeks and you can both get an IGG test rather than trying to calculate the probability he was infected. It will give you guys more time to get to know each other and research safe ways to be intimate together if he is positive. ### Yeah, you are wrong. There's also a chance you have herpes and don't know yourself. ### Thanks for this reply!

My understanding is that he had unprotected sex multiple times with the woman who is HSV2 positive. I will try to find out from him how many times and when she was first infected. Am I right in thinking that the likelihood of transmission drops over time meaning if she's been living with HSV2 for several years it would be less likely to transmit? I don’t know if she was/is taking antiviral meds but will also try to find out from him. The 4% rate that you quote is quite reassuring. Do you have a reference for that please?

I would absolutely be using condoms with him until he can get an IGG test at 12+ weeks post the last exposure. My question is more whether refraining from all (condom-protected) genital-to-genital contact and PIV sex is prudent in the intervening time as I very much wish to avoid HSV2 if possible for a variety of reasons.

Point well taken about the mutual testing. I did the IGG test about three years ago and was negative for both HSV1 / HSV2 and have only had two new sexual partners since but will happily take it again with him. He has had significantly more sexual partners than me so a general check for us both could be a good idea anyway. ### Additional question if that’s ok:

If he did happen to contract HSV2 from her (by engaging in oral and/or PIV sex), could this pass to me via oral sex (giving and/or receiving) now? Or it’s more genital-to-genital contact and PIV sex that’s the risk? ### Thanks, it’s the standard I would expect of a sexual partner. I guess this is what I’m leaning towards, waiting 8 weeks (it’s already been 4 weeks since his last exposure I think) although that feels long. ### OP wrote a fairly extensive post, and talked about multiple issues. For you to simply claim that ""she's wrong"", without specifying what it is that you believe she is wrong about, is not helpful. ### >The 4% rate that you quote is quite reassuring. Do you have a reference for that please?

The preceding stats are regularly quoted by herpes expert Terri Warren on her online forum. Terri has a 35+ year career researching and treating herpes specifically, and was personally involved in the large-scale studies that determined the base transmission rates with vs without suppressive medication. 

Here are some examples of her stating the 4% stat:

>Without suppression on condoms, the transmission rates for HSV 2 infected females to uninfected males is about 4% – antivirals reduce the risk by half – condoms take the risk down to around 1-2%.

([Source](https://westoverheights.com/forum/question/how-to-time-a-wb-test/))

>The risk of transmission to an uninfected partner while you were taking Valtrex and having sex about twice per week is about 2% per year. If he uses condoms in addition, the rate drops to about 1% per year. More sex, more risk. 

([Source](https://westoverheights.com/forum/question/hsv2-for-9-months-questions-for-new-partner/))

>If you had been having sex with her twice a week for a year, not using condoms but with her on treatment, the risk of you becoming infected would be about 2%. So you can do the math and see how low your risk is for a single encounter.

([Source](https://westoverheights.com/forum/question/hsv2-worry/))

Etc.

If you search her forum for mentions of ""4%"" you are likely to find many more instances.

>My question is more whether refraining from all (condom-protected) genital-to-genital contact and PIV sex is prudent in the intervening time as I very much wish to avoid HSV2 if possible for a variety of reasons.

Well that's somewhat of a subjective question. You've seen the base transmission stats above for when condoms are used, and that's when the male *definitely* has ghsv2. That risk is *very* low. In your case the risk would be lower still, because it isn't clear that your partner even has it, and it's considerably more likely than not that he doesn't. 

Different people are comfortable with different levels of risk, but I would suggest to you that if you've had sex with partners in the past without requiring them to get tested first, that the risk here is about the same as it was in those past situations -- because some of your past partners have all but certainly had sex with people who had hsv2, whether they did so knowingly or not. Unless you've always insisted on testing before sex, or unless you've only had a very small number of partners so far, it's likely you've had sex with people in the past who had hsv2 also. And you've all but certainly had sex with partners who've had sex with people who had it. ### Both kinds of genital herpes, genital hsv1 and genital hsv2, post a very low risk of genital-to-oral transmission if no outbreak is present.

No matter whether a person has genital hsv1 or genital hsv2, the risk of genital-to-oral transmission is very low so long as no outbreak is present.

Genital hsv1 poses a very low risk of genital-to-oral transmission outside of an active outbreak because genital hsv1 is one of the least active kinds of herpes there is. It very rarely sheds asymptomatically (ie very rarely becomes active on the skin surface without causing actual visible symptoms). Then add to that the fact that the vast majority of exposures to asymptomatic shedding don't result in transmission *anyway*, and you can see the risk is very low. Genital hsv1 poses a very low risk of genital-to-*genital* transmission outside of active outbreaks for the same reason.

Genital hsv2, meanwhile, asymptomatically sheds considerably more frequently than genital hsv1. But hsv2 has a very strong preference for the genital region. Even when it is given the opportunity to infect orally it usually doesn't bother. Oral hsv2 *can* happen but is very uncommon. Here's a relevant quote from herpes expert Terri Warren:

>Getting HSV 2 orally through giving oral sex is very rare – I cannot say it is impossible. But with meds and no outbreak, the risk is incredibly low.

([Source](https://westoverheights.com/forum/question/hsv2hsv1-genital-oral-transmission/))

Furthermore still, in the very unlikely event that you *were* to get infected orally with hsv2, be aware that oral hsv2 is probably the best kind of herpes to have. First, it is the least active kind of herpes, by *far*. It hardly ever outbreaks beyond the first outbreak, and poses a virtually negligible risk to partners when no actual outbreak is present. And second, an established oral hsv2 infection not only provides protection against later infection with genital hsv2, but also protects against later infection with oral or genital hsv1. Basically, the least problematic kind of herpes protects against all the other kinds. It can take up to four months for a herpes infection to become established (ie to result in the body producing enough antibodies to protect from any further infection), but many people will have the protection in place much sooner than that. So this is something worth reflecting on also. Many people who have other kinds of herpes wish they could have caught oral hsv2 instead. ### Ok, I'm not always helpful. Sometimes I'm just on the internet. ### Thanks for this reply and the sources. I’ve had four sexual partners in my life, three very short-term with condoms and one very long-term with / without, always talked about STIs before and insisted on testing (not HSV2 though) after the first encounter. None of them were knowingly HSV2 positive or exposed, although of course like you say yes it’s possible I do think my overall risk / exposure to date has been quite low. Hearing someone say they’ve been knowingly exposed to HSV2 in the past month through unprotected PIV sex feels quite different, and although the risk is less than 2% according to Terri I think the mental health impacts of me contracting HSV2 would be severe so something I’d like to carefully avoid. ### Thanks so much, and this is nice to know re oral HSV2! ### >>For you to simply claim that ""she's wrong"", without specifying what it is that you believe she is wrong about, is not helpful.

>Ok, I'm not always helpful. Sometimes I'm just on the internet.

tfv78t,I have HSV2. My doctor said as long as the virus is not active I cannot transmit it to other people. ,2,2022-03-16 18:39:24-04:00,">I have HSV2. My doctor said as long as the virus is not active I cannot transmit it to other people.

That's incorrect. The stats are for asymptomatic genital hsv2 transmission are well established:

---

**Male-to-Female Ghsv2 transmission risk:**

In studies of couples in long term relationships (ie together at least 3 months already) where the man has genital hsv2 and the woman doesn't and they both know he has it, if they have *unprotected* sex for an entire year (approximately twice per week) except during outbreaks, and the man takes no herpes medication, the woman has about a 10% chance of becoming infected by the end of the year.

Having sex more or less often than twice per week would raise or lower that base figure accordingly. Also note that that base figure comes from studies of couples already in long term relationships, and herpes is slightly more likely to transmit when the partners have been together less than 3 months. We aren't sure exactly *how* much higher the risk is before the 3-month mark, but we know its definitely higher. We also know that herpes is more active when the infection is recent, eg during the first 6-12 months of having it (the decline is gradual).

If the man takes daily herpes medication that would lower the risk to the woman by about 50%, bringing the annual risk from about 10% down to about 5%. Furthermore, condoms have been found to provide women with a very high level of protection from herpes, though not quite complete. One recent large scale study found that condoms reduce male-to-female herpes transmission risk by a further 96%. Herpes expert Terri Warren thinks that might be a *bit* on the high side, but not by much. So consider well over a further 90% reduction. So without condoms or medication, the annual risk to the woman is about 10%. With medication it falls to about 5%. With condoms but no medication it would be about 1%. And with medication *and* condoms it's well under 1%. 

**Female-to-Male Ghsv2 transmission risk:**

If the situation is reversed and it's the woman who has genital hsv2 and the man doesn't and they both know she has it, if they have unprotected sex for an entire year (approximately twice per week) except during outbreaks and the woman takes no herpes medication, the man has a 4% chance of becoming infected by the end of the year.

To reiterate: having sex more or less often than twice per week would raise or lower that base figure accordingly. And that base figure comes from studies of couples already in long term relationships, and herpes is slightly more likely to transmit when the partners have been together less than 3 months, or when the infection is still fairly recent (eg first six months etc).

Condom use and herpes medication would each lower the female-to-male transmission risk by about 50% further from whatever it was before. So if the couple uses condoms *or* the woman takes medication, the annual risk to the man comes down to about 2%. And if they use both, it comes down to about 1%. As you can see, men are at considerably less risk of catching herpes than women when no condoms are used. But men also gain considerably less protection from condoms than do women.

Again, all those transmissions above refer to when no outbreak is present. With precautions, the risk *can* be brought down to very low levels. But what your doctor told you is fundamentally wrong. ### Where can I find some of this information on hsv1 :) ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tfv78t/i_have_hsv2_my_doctor_said_as_long_as_the_virus/

He knows about my herpes I disclosed and he is completely fine with it and accepts the risks. There are plenty of people like this who do not care.

Please reach out if you need anything!! I promise it gets better! ### I feel this as a female at 22 years old im in my prime ### Hey buddy.

Ik there's a lot of solid support here, but I thought I'd say my piece. 

I wasted years, and the best connection of my life, in your mindset. Don't. Really, just don't. It's not worth it. You'll wake up a decade later and realise that all the time you felt you had shit in your blood or whatever, you could've been living your life. 

If you need to take a break from sexuality, do that. Every time you wish you were out on the pull, practise something. Even cooking. Damn sure the love of your life will be more in love with your ability to whip up a gorgeous meal than your genitalia when you're seventy anyhow. ### Hello, I also felt the same when I found out I caught HSV1 on my genitals. It was an awful time. Practice self love and focus on yourself. I’m also only 20 now and found out when I was 16. Your life isn’t over. I’m extremely open to almost anyone that I have herpes and it was comforting to realise a lot of people I know have it as well. You’re sex life isn’t ruined either, just make sure to be honest to a partner, use protection and chances are they won’t catch anything unless you’re having an outbreak. I have been with my boyfriend for 2 years and have had unprotected sex since the start of our relationship. He got tested the other month and he still hasn’t caught it. ### I got diagnosed with ghsv1 when I was 19 and thought my life was over too. I’m 39 now and I’ve had a great sex life… my partners all accepted it about me, we were safe and none of them caught it. I only get a super minor outbreak every couple years. I try to take good care of my health and supplement with lysine. Youll be ok 💜 ### Bro having herpes has effected my sex life 0. I have never disclosed to a person who rejected me because of the herpes - I’ve slept with many of them the same night. It’s legit not a big deal. It’s so common. Hella my friends have it. Hella people I know who are married have it and have not given it to their partner - including my brother. Your life is only lost if you believe it to be. ### I’m 35 Male I contracted HSV when I was 23 I got very depressed about it for a couple years but ended up coping with my depression with training and exercise at the gym! I had the same mentality but it’s not the end of the world. It took me like 4years to start dating again, and every girl I talked to I would let them know I have hsv before things went any further! I’m now 5years married and I have a newborn so there is hope in living a normal life, don’t let this obstacle cripple you! ### I found out when I was 20 & I felt that same kind of things you’re feeling. That was over 6 years ago. The first guy I was dating a after I found out said he was cool with it & then while we were having sex started freaking out about it… so that was awful & made me 10x more depressed. But I’ve been with some people since then, the first actual boyfriend I had shortly after my diagnosis was hsv positive as well. So it’s not totally impossible to find someone else who has it, even though I know it may feel that way. All the ones that weren’t positive didn’t mind like I feared they would, & I haven’t given it to anybody as far as I know. I don’t know your gender identity but I’m a woman so I will be honest about the fact that I’ve seen a lot of people say it’s easier for women than for men. Either way I hope this is helpful to you. The thing that helped me the most was being on antivirals daily. It takes away a lot of the guilt you may feel of putting others at risk, because it significantly minimizes the risk of passing it on. & it gives whoever you’re with at the moment peace of mind as well. Despite all this though, I still get the overwhelming anxiety & fear when I have to disclose, so I don’t really do casual hookups. It’s still an emotional topic for me so I don’t feel comfortable discussing it with anybody I don’t trust a little bit on an emotional level. Hang in there, do some research on how common this is, don’t let yourself fall into a spiral of negative thoughts. It’s never gonna feel great but it definitely gets easier to live with. ### i’ve had herpes for a month now, and i’m 18 years old and felt exactly the same! I used to laugh at the jokes and swore i’d never get herpes, but now I literally don’t know how I did. maybe God needed to humble me. I have type 1 genital, and I just don’t know where I could’ve gotten it from. you will find someone who cares about you deeply. they’ll be able to look past this disease. I was so devastated I was going to kill myself, but I realized that it isn’t as bad as I thought. it’s only the stigma. if you need to talk to someone, i’m all ears. you’re not alone in this. 

I don’t usually comment on posts like these, but I agree i’m hoping for a cure in the next 5 years that’s affordable. More people have it than they realize, and the worst thing about this disease is the stigma only. over 60% of the US population has herpes. I promise it’s way more common than you think and there’s support groups (online & private) that you can join! like I said you can always dm if you need anything! don’t let this take control of your life because a cure will come eventually! ### Well i do not have herpes but my husband of 7 years does. He told me before we had sex and since then I knew that I needed to be with someone who was so honest and could be so vulnerable. This isn’t a life sentence. It sucks, but any woman worth loving will understand. Teens have a hard time grasping the concept but trust me, older adults understand that it’s not as taboo. ### Some people don’t want to hear what you have to say but I haven’t had sex in years I’m super sad about that and I feel the same way pretty much life has ended ### im getting my results tomorrow, 99% sure its gonna be positive after what the doctor told me. im 21 & had a really active sex life, just been feeling like complete shit now and lost my drive to keep going. i heard u can avoid infecting others by using a condom & only have sex when there’s no outbreak, but there’s still a small chance. i would feel disgusting and so embarrassed if i’d infect an innocent girl with this shit.. both of my doctors also told me that i shouldn’t tell random hookups because it’ll ruin my sex life, can’t disagree with that but infecting someone else is my biggest scare right now. :/ ### Only you can decide what is right for you! But try dating someone with herpes then ### [removed] ### I know how you feel.. mine was given to me through infidelity and I also have to deal with the rage. It’s horrible because you don’t need to have an active outbreak to give it to somebody. One of my friends was drunk and went to kiss me on the cheek this weekend and hit my lips and I’ve been in a panic because the reality is I don’t want anybody to have to go through what I went through. People say it’s stigmatized sure but wait until you give it to somebody in their life is in shambles and they know exactly where it came from. And then their life is forever changed as well. I can’t go a week without an outbreak.. takes me weeks to heal and then I’ll make it to almost a week and I get one again. I have a horrible immune system that’s severely immuno compromised on top of that i’m allergic to Valtrex and all the other medication‘s because as my doctor said it’s the same active ingredient in all of them including acyclovir, etc.. i’m so sorry that you are going through this as well🥺 ### Omgosh, you are being dramatic which you are definitely allowed to do, you can be sad and depressed and work through the feelings and once you get past this and look back.... you will see you are being dramatic.

Most of us realize that we were being dramatic due to the lack of knowledge and the stigma surrounding herpes. I just laugh at it. It's hilarious. It's something I hardly care about. My EBV disrupts my life more than my HSV does. There are much more important things to think and worry about than herpes.

So, go through it how you will... but you are being dramatic. ### If i have a positive partner who i trust and love then i believe he will be careful and let me know (as will i) when he has an OB. After the OB heals then we get on with life as usual. Its a small price to pay to be with your person. Ill pay it and i know he will too. Someday. ### Lots of women out there feeling the same. ### Even if you ONLY date women that already have it, that's still a HUGE pool of women. If anything, it would probably be a bonding experience between the two of you since you've both ""been through the same thing."" Most girls dread disclosing their status on a 1st or 2nd date, so it would probably be a huge relief to them if they don't have to worry about rejection or spreading. I don't know why so many folks act like their sex life is over. I almost feel like this could improve someone's sex life if they only date people that are obviously sexually active. ### I think many of us felt that way in the beginning.  Love has a way of working out the kinks, please, trust in that.  You're handing this the best way you know how.  Give things time to settle and acclimate.  You will learn about the signals your body gives you when having a flare up.  You will learn to adjust accordingly.  This is coming from someone dealing with HSV for 30 plus years.  I've been married twice and had many sexual relationships in my 52 years.  GIVE yourself time.... ### Thanks for taking your time to create a list like that. ### Literally same. I should be out here having fun yet at 22 I’m burnt out. I hate this. ### Take a deep breath, this is a very common and stigmatized disease.  You should also note, that as a woman you are far more likely after disclosure to not have any issues.

Don’t let the fact pharma stigmatized this in the 70s in the US break you down.  I know the feeling, but it will be okay.  When I was 19 I had a woman disclose she had HSV and I passed.  By the time I was in my early 20s, I had sexual encounters with many women that disclosed, without protection (not advocating for this), and had a blast.  I got HSV-1 from my kids - my daughter gave me a big hug and kiss when I got home, and had nasty cold sores the next day, I got symptoms a few days later, and transferred it from my face to G during my primary infection just a couple of days later.  Grand times.

I am not in a situation where I need to dislocose.  I respect people that chose to. But the CDC either needs to recommend HSV is tested in al STI panels, or society needs to stop pressuring on disclosure.  They’re putting a huge stigma and burden on a very small % of those infected, and it’s not right.

If society want’s disclosure, everyone should know their status to the best of their ability.

Controversial views on this sub, but I think it’s okay to share them. ### [deleted] ### You have hsv2? ### The jokes are funny ### I’m getting my results soon too and I’m also sure it’s going to be positive and I can really feel your pain I’m 19 and it feels like my life is ruined. I can’t even begin to imagine how I’m going to tell people it because so many people are uneducated about it and will shame you for it. It’s hard to imagine telling a guy and he starts being disgusted with me. It will definitely be though mentally but you are not alone. ### I second this! There’s a lot of people who have HSV and are willing to date. I totally understand feeling depressed about the diagnosis, especially when you’re young. So many people have cold sores and have it; they are just super uneducated about the condition. We are just some of the lucky ones to know we have it and have to have a convo with our partners prior to having sex. I had to seek therapy to help me. There’s a lot of help out there. ### Comment removed. That is a known bogus treatment.

There is no cure for herpes at the present time -- whether natural or pharmaceutical. Anyone who claims otherwise is either extremely poorly informed or is trying to scam others. If/when an actual, legitimate cure is developed it will be front page news all over the world and will be readily confirmed as genuine by well known and highly respected figures in the medical community, as opposed to being promoted by random websites or instagram posts or youtube videos by people that either no one has ever heard of, or who have no formal medical training whatsoever, and whose claims have not been independently verified by any person or agency with any established reputation that is qualified to do so and whose credentials can be readily verified.

Be aware that the people promoting these ""cures"" often believe that a negative IgG blood test result is evidence that they have cured themselves or others, when all it actually demonstrates is that they don't have an even *basic* understanding of herpes testing. An IgG blood test routinely misses 8% of hsv2 infections and a whopping 30% of hsv1 infections. This is well established. So if you come across someone claiming they have cured themselves and their evidence is a negative IgG blood test, that fact alone indicates that they have no clue what they're talking about and have *not* cured themselves. An IgG test would not be an appropriate test for determining whether herpes has been cured. ### On my life ### Thank you for sharing, and I agree. Interesting, I put my HSV status on my dating bio, and I still have to disclose it because of people's ignorance... And when I do, they are stunned! Mostly shaming behavior, you know, ‘oh shit’ type comments... They burden me with having to keep them safe. But I do feel for my fellow man. Therefore I do. 😕 ### Are you not in a position to disclose because you have ghsv1 instead of ghsv2? I (24F) just got diagnosed with ghsv1 from this guy who went down on me who didn’t know he had oral hsv1. I’m terrified of having to tell future partners about it, but I guess that’s something I need to get over… but for a casual hookup, not during an outbreak and using protection, do people with ghsv1 generally not disclose? ### No I don’t. I’ve had 3 outbreaks over the past 4 years, including my very first one when I found out I’d caught herpes x ### No i have hsv1. However my brother has HSV2 and he’s married and in an open relationship where he has multiple partners (who also have multiple partners). It is harder for him disclosure wise cuz he has outbreaks a few times a year and I never have them, but he still has a much more vibrant sex and dating life than most people I know - and since his diagnosis has not been single for any significant period of time. He did not give it to his wife or any other partners. ### I’m 22 as well. I’ve disclosed three times since being diagnosed in May 2020. It went pretty well to be honest! I was also in a yr relationship in 2021 (no longer am). I’m only sexually active with people I disclose too and those I am not I only share when I feel ready. Half of the time with a lot of the men I meet  we end up just not being compatible so things drop off and we never end up being intimate to begin with. Honestly living with this virus has cut down on the partners I am intimate with and as someone who lacked confidence, self-love and consistently sought out external validation through sex. It has been a blessing. Not everyone deserves to have such intimate access to my body and those that do have to be willing to accept all parts of me (virus included). It also has aided me in slowing down and actually get to know people now and using my discernment a-lot better. It helps to be educated about the virus as well! ### Message me if you ever need to vent! ### Oh okay good to know. Thanks man. ### ",31,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tf7vtl/mortified/

GHSV-1 are becoming more common because people are no longer getting OHSV-1 as kids. People are more aware that cold sores are contagious so refrain from kissing kids when they have an outbreak and most contagious. 

So young people are first becoming exposed during oral sex.

Once a strain has infected you in one spot you won't get it in another spot.

tflr99,"Meds no longer working, I'm in excruciating pain EVERY MONTH. It's not ""just a rash"". Is this just my life now? I can't do it. I just had the WORST doctor's appointment I've ever had, and I feel so hopeless. I emailed my ob/gyn last week because I'm having terrible outbreaks every single month, and I was getting desperate. I already changed from acyclovir to Valacyclovir because the first wasn't helping. I take 500mgs a day for prevention and 2000mgs a day when I feel symptoms coming on. If this is helping, I can't imagine what NOT taking it would be like. 

I thought I had covid again because my body hurt SO MUCH. I had to take two days off work because I felt like I'd been scalded and skinned from my kidneys to my foot. My muscles hurt, my joints hurt, my skin hurt. The lesion is the least painful part. It starts the week before my period and I'm literally in bed for at least 3-4 days. 

I emailed my doctor to ask if anything else could be done and I guess she's out of town but her staff made me a phone appointment with a different doctor. When she called she had no idea what I needed and when I started crying because I'm so uncomfortable talking about this and feeling so hopeless, she was completely rude and dismissive. I pulled myself together, told her I already tried acyclovir and exactly how much Valtrex I take, and she first came back with ""well, you can try acyclovir instead, it works a little differently"". I literally just told you I've tried it. Then she asked AGAIN how much Valtrex I take. I JUST SAID THAT! And she offered me lidocaine. There isn't enough lidocaine in the world. It's not the lesion that hurts! It's everything else! 

I feel like I can't express how terrible this is, and because I have a history of depression and anxiety, they treat me like I'm just being dramatic but it feels SO BAD!

I had been struggling with a nonstop contant string of outbreaks for 4 months straight. You're welcome to check my post history if you want to read into my situation a little. Antivirals stopped working out of the blue after 8 years and I was being ravaged by this virus, much like you. No relief in sight, I felt absolutely hopeless.

And then I discovered SADBE. I'm sure you've seen in mentioned here and there on this sub along with a whole host of other ""suppliments."" I had brushed it off for so long... and then I actually decided to look into it. It's incredible. 

Squarex is a company currently raising funds for phase 3 clinical trials for the use of SADBE for HSV. Its a medication you rub into a dime size area on your inner arm once every 3 months and it's been shown to cause aassive reduction in HSV outbreaks. 

The struggle is that its not on the market for HSV. So if you want to try it you have to convince a doctor to prescribe it for you off-label. You have to thoroughly educate yourself on the clinical trials and come armed with knowledge. I was turned down by my OB when I asked him to prescribe it... but I was lucky enough to have a primary doctor kind enough to let me try. I did my first application of SADBE 3.5 weeks ago and for the first time in 4 months (of absolute HELL)  I'm completely outbreak free.

With genital hsv1 that is possible but *very* unlikely. Some might say *extremely* unlikely. It's important to qualify your statement.

I haven’t had sex since the diagnosis but if the stats are true I think you’re good.

Sometimes you need to let others takes the risk for you, where the willingly know what they're going into. ### It’s so good that you care so much about passing it on. It shows how selfless you are. But, people who are with us will always be taking the risk of being infected (to be fair, anyone is always taking that risk no matter who they’re with, but it’s more conscious for our partners). It’s their decision. All we can do is communicate when we feel we might be risky and abstain at those times. That’s it. 
To be fair, I don’t even know if anyone truly understands herpes transmission. I’ve sadly had it since childhood, and have never (as far as I know) transmitted it to any of my 16 sexual partners. I’d imagine it’s because I’m in tune with my symptoms and careful, but when I was younger and knew nothing about it, not so much. 
Most people will have some form of herpes by older age. It’s okay, it’s only an annoying skin condition. Go easy on yourself. ### I see. Well that’s good. But should we not be prepared for the worst?

I may be working myself up tbh. ### > As long as she accepts the risk I think you got the green light.

That's something I try to remember. If I give someone all the information, they consent to the risk, it's out of my hands. If I end up transmitting it, I will not beat myself up about it or feel guilty, because they made their choice. It feels callous, but there is no way in Hell we should blame ourselves when we did everything in our power to live healthy, normal sex lives. ### I guess that’s all we can do huh?

Ultimately if you’re really scared about it you can use condoms until you’re either really serious with the girl or until you’re more comfortable with the diagnosis ### Also the way I think of it is if I’m on antivirals and a condom I have about the same chance of getting a girl pregnant with a condom of as i do passing the virus along ### Disclose. I’m sure the person who gave it to you did not. Hence your current state. ### Exactly.

In studies of couples in long term relationships (ie together at least 3 months already) where the man has genital hsv2 and the woman doesn't and they both know he has it, if they have *unprotected* sex for an entire year (approximately twice per week) except during outbreaks, and the man takes no herpes medication, the woman has about a 10% chance of becoming infected by the end of the year.

Having sex more or less often than twice per week would raise or lower that base figure accordingly. Also note that that base figure comes from studies of couples already in long term relationships, and herpes is slightly more likely to transmit when the partners have been together less than 3 months. We aren't sure exactly *how* much higher the risk is before the 3-month mark, but we know its definitely higher. We also know that herpes is more active when the infection is recent, eg during the first 6-12 months of having it (the decline is gradual).

If the man takes daily herpes medication that would lower the risk to the woman by about 50%, bringing the annual risk from about 10% down to about 5%. Furthermore, condoms have been found to provide women with a very high level of protection from herpes, though not quite complete. One recent large scale study found that condoms reduce male-to-female herpes transmission risk by a further 96%. Herpes expert Terri Warren thinks that might be a *bit* on the high side, but not by much. So consider well over a further 90% reduction. So without condoms or medication, the annual risk to the woman is about 10%. With medication it falls to about 5%. With condoms but no medication it would be about 1%. And with medication *and* condoms it's well under 1%. 

**Female-to-Male Ghsv2 transmission risk:**

If the situation is reversed and it's the woman who has genital hsv2 and the man doesn't and they both know she has it, if they have unprotected sex for an entire year (approximately twice per week) except during outbreaks and the woman takes no herpes medication, the man has a 4% chance of becoming infected by the end of the year.

To reiterate: having sex more or less often than twice per week would raise or lower that base figure accordingly. And that base figure comes from studies of couples already in long term relationships, and herpes is slightly more likely to transmit when the partners have been together less than 3 months, or when the infection is still fairly recent (eg first six months etc).

Condom use and herpes medication would each lower the female-to-male transmission risk by about 50% further from whatever it was before. So if the couple uses condoms *or* the woman takes medication, the annual risk to the man comes down to about 2%. And if they use both, it comes down to about 1%. As you can see, men are at considerably less risk of catching herpes than women when no condoms are used. But men also gain considerably less protection from condoms than do women. ### Just out of curiosity how many months did it take for you to become positive. I tested neg after 12 weeks and wondering if I should retest. If you are on daily antivirals and wear a condom transmission is about 2.5% per year I believe. ### If no condom I think it’s 5% chance per year ### 5% chance a year, that being sex twice a week ### [deleted] ### >If you are on daily antivirals and wear a condom transmission is about 2.5% per year I believe.

Just a heads up that, no, with condoms it's actually considerably lower than that. Please see my reply to OP on the main thread where I provided the stats. ### I’ve been testing for it since July of 2021 hsv 1 and 2 it finally was positive in January and the only symptom is a bump no itch no pain or anything it’s just a constant bump ### Were you on antivirals this whole time while testing? Or did you just start ### How long have you had the bump for? I’m experiencing similar issues and have had a bump that’s been there for the past 6 weeks. Although I’m having tingly sensation on the tip of my penis ### >I’m experiencing similar issues and have had a bump that’s been there for the past 6 weeks.

Herpes lesions last 2-10 days and they go through their entire series of phases within that time (blister formation, blister, blister surface erosion leaving an ulcer, crusting/scabbing, and scab healing), so they don't remain looking unchanged for more than a day or two either.

Your bump can be ruled out as being herpes based on the length of time it has been there. ### [removed] ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tfm9kn/still_new_and_have_questions/
tfm6gz,Sunlight I just recently got diagnosed with hsv1 and I’ve read a lot that sunlight is a trigger for outbreaks. This winter has been long and miserable and with the weather finally starting to break it made me wonder if I can keep up with my usually routine of laying in the sun. I don’t use tanning beds or anything like that but in the summer with the hot sun beating down on me I love to lay out in it for about an hour at a time. Am I still going to be able to do this without getting an outbreak? I’m also suppose to go to Florida this summer and I’m terrified of not being able to enjoy myself due to the sun. Any comments welcomed! Still new to the hsv life so I’m trying to navigate it best I can.,2,2022-03-16 12:36:32-04:00,"For me personally, sun exposure does not influence my outbreak frequency. I have GHSV2 and I can lay out naked for hours with no issues. My partner on the other hand has OHSV1, and is very sensitive to things like over-chapped lips, windburn and sunburn. Any irritation to the lips and he gets worried he might get a cold sore. I think HSV this is just one of those things where everyone's body reacts differently. And you will unfortunately just need to play it by ear while you learn how your body does. My advice though is for the summer, make sure you are properly hydrated, wear high SPF on your face and/or a hat, use chapsticks and other irritation preventatives. From my experience if your skin is happy then OBs are less likely to flare up due to irritants/sun exposure. You could also ask your doctor for information if you are worried (because a doctor I am not. Can only speak for myself and reiterate what my partner has expressed to me). Hope this helps. ### Sunlight only effects my oral herpes not my genital. I think it’s more of a dry skin thing.

I hated the experience and will never do it again, however, we didn’t use condoms and there is a very high chance I have herpes now. Waiting or the test results to come in.

My question is, if the herpes is isolated to my anus, am I good? Can I still spread it if I don’t let anyone near my anus? I really don’t know how it works and cant find this answer on google. I don’t have anything on my mount or dick, it’s only on my anus.

It's herpes and it can spread or breakout anywhere in the boxer shorts area. ### All you did was contract it through anal. Yes you can still spread it through your man goods. It doesn’t stay in one area(of the genital area) like that. ### Anal herpes checking in: I have always wondered this too. I've only ever had a blister on one of two places around my butthole, so I'm inclined to think those are the locations where the virus would hypothetically shed and if everyone just avoids my butt, would the risk of transmission decrease significantly? Of course no one is or will ever research this, so the general advice will always remain that if you're HSV2+ you're always contagious everywhere 😞 ### it may have been researched  as viral shedding  is a risk     i would think  the viral shedding would be in the infected area ..so if there is no contact  in this area  you d lessen your chance for passing this on

daily valcyclovir 500 mg could be helpful 
there may be other thoughts ? ### also is this hsv 1 or hsv 2  ? ### seems like there is no scientific consensus. i would think since the lymphnodes in that entire area are usually affected, you should assume shedding is possible through your junk. but i'd personally consider it less of a risk, just on a hunch. ### Are you sure?

Oral herpes isn’t contracted through genitals USUALLY. Can still happen through oral sex. But no he can’t spread genital herpes by just kissing  someone. ### He’s specifically asking if he can still spread it still without someone touching his anal area.

No, those would definitely *not* be common symptoms for someone with oral hsv1 and those particular symptoms do *not* suggest that you caught oral hsv1. They don't rule out the possibility, but they don't suggest it either.

tes3d6,"Someone I'm newly dating has HSV-2 - want to educate myself about risk and safe practices Hi all -

Someone I *very* recently started seeing disclosed that he has HSV-2. First, I want to say that I have a lot of respect for him for being so transparent.

He told me he tested positive about 17/18 years ago, and has never actually had an outbreak. He gets tested for STDs routinely, so he tested positive without symptoms. He also told me that since being diagnosed, to his knowledge he hasn't passed it onto a partner (of course there's no way to be sure unless tested as they could be asymptomatic).

Given we aren't exclusive, I would use a condom with him regardless but am open to any other advice about risk in this situation.

Thanks :)",40,2022-03-15 11:51:51-04:00,"I'm going to paste exactly what I wrote earlier today to someone.   
  
I'm a 29M and have had HSV2 for over three years. HSV2 commonly affects the genitals but can be oral as well; HSV1, while preferring the mouth, is responsible for up to half of new genital herpes infections. I've had a total of four outbreaks (all in the first year). I haven't had any outbreaks since. This is how it is even for a vast majority of people that get this. Over 80% of people that contract HSV2 NEVER have ANY symptoms and are out there spreading this because they have no idea they have it. An estimated 1/6 Americans have HSV2. For those who have symptoms at first, the outbreaks decrease with severity and amount and eventually will cease entirely. Most of the horror stories on here are the exception, not the rule - I would say probably 5-10% of the people who get herpes are likely immunocompromised and suffer recurrent outbreaks - which can easily be managed with antivirals. It is, as is often described, a skin infection - one that doesn't decrease your lifespan or really affect your ability to have children (neonatal herpes being passed through childbirth is 3 times less likely than you giving birth to a child with down syndrome).  
  
Having this myself, I can say that this is NOT a big deal at all and I do not get the stigma surrounding it. That's really the only problem IMO about having this - others' assumptions and stereotypes about the infection. I will say this - of course, for a guy, the symptoms aren't as painful because if we do get sores, they tend to be outside versus inside. It's very possible you already have it or HSV1. Ironically, if this guy ONLY has HSV2 and didn't ever have HSV1 and you did, YOU could have given him genital herpes. I am in this boat, I tested negative for HSV1 when I got tested a few months back for my HSV negative partner.  
  
If you all have 2-3 sex acts per week, there is about a 10% chance of you acquiring the virus in a given year (this is without protection). Again, if you contract it - there is an over 80% chance you never get ANY symptoms. Daily antivirals reduce the chances to about 5% per year. Condoms, conservatively, reduce the chances by another 50%; however there is research by Teri Warren that shows condom use may reduce transmission rates from M to F by up to 96%. Conservatively, the use of antivirals AND condoms will result in a 2.5% yearly chance - but we may be talking well under 1% due to condom use with antivirals. Oral with HSV2 is generally safe as it does not like the mouth area, but is still possible (but under 1%); use a condom at first if you're not comfortable. Also, the longer he has it, the less he sheds the virus. If he's asymptomatic (doesn't have outbreaks anymore) this also leads to a reduction in overall shedding. People without symptoms shed less on average than those that still get outbreaks. Asymptomatic shedding (with no sores) IS responsible for up to 70% of transmissions, so YES, that IS possible, but again, this is hindered by taking daily antivirals and condoms.  
  
The vast majority of us on here that got it (90%+) was NOT from someone who disclosed and was honest with us; it was from someone who didn't know they had it OR KNEW AND LIED/NEVER TOLD. I was in the second boat; my ex-girlfriend knew she had it and didn't tell me out of fear I would have rejected her. If she had told me, I would have not have rejected her; her being honest with me and showing me all the precautions would have been a massive green flag for me and by taking those precautions I VERY LIKELY would not have it today.  
  
For the few that have contracted it after taking the risk and when given the choice, the anecdotes I've seen from people is that they didn't contract it until years into the relationship - which at that point I would imagine most people are happily married and don't care anymore.  
  
This guy is presumably looking for a long-term relationship and by telling you this is communicating his desire to be honest with you, even with the chance that you turn him down as a result. Clearly, he's not looking to lie to you or mislead for the possibility of cheap sex; so many people pass this on or lie about it just to get laid. Consider that a MASSIVE GREEN FLAG.  
  
Still, if you're hesitant, I recommend taking it slow with him and getting to know if you two are compatible. Sex is good, sex is great; but I'm taking it slow with a woman who is HSV negative right now because I desire so much more. Sounds like he does too. ### I would ask if he’s on antivirals and maybe ask what measures he took in the past to make sure he didn’t pass it. I’m sure someone here will provide you with more specific transition rates than I can as I am a female with ghsv and from my understanding the rates are different between male to female vs female to male transmission. From my understanding the longer you have it the less likely it gets to shed - as your body learns to fight it off and create more antibodies. And seeming as he said he’s had it for 17/18 years it could be low. As long as you know the risk isn’t completely 0, you yourself have to make sure you’re okay with the possibility of getting it. Asking questions and doing your own research is already a great step in the right direction. Thanks for being understanding and educating yourself hope you find the info you’re looking for! ### Transmissibility decreases over time, after 17/18 years he very likely is not contagious anymore as his immune system successfully suppresses the virus from replicating to communicable levels. Why it's so important that HSV2+ people try to live healthy lives! Combined with not having symptoms or outbreaks, he is a VERY low risk. Go for it! ### There’s condoms you can order from Japan (vivagel) that are supposed to be virucidal to HSV. I’m sure if you rub one of those condoms on all exposed areas it would kill most of the HSV but I’m not sure. I’ve used SADBE and red marine algae to get my infection under good immune control but I’m not sure how that effects shedding/transmission but I assume I’m less contagious. He may want to try those interventions to reduce shedding and risk of transmission. Also I thinks clinical trial is starting this year from a ohiladelphia doctor for a preventative vaccine for HSV so if you could get into the trial that would eliminate much of your worry. ### You may fine this info helpful. Just general facts and research links. https://www.cocodensmore.com/post/a-completely-boring-herpes-educational-blog-post-that-you-should-absolutely-read-anyway ### If they take meds regularly and don’t have a outbreak you’re fine . It’s not a big deal ### I will say, it is possible that he could’ve had a false positive test result, but if he gets tested frequently then maybe not, unless they aren’t testing him for herpes again (which is actually pretty common). if his IgG result is below 3.5, it is possible that it was a false positive. Let’s assume he’s actually positive, after 17/18 years the risk of transmission drops. HSV is most contagious during an outbreak (which he says he doesn’t have), but can be spread when asymptomatic (but this risk goes down over the years). I highly recommend asking him what he does to prevent OBs. If he doesn’t do anything, he might be willing to if you were to ask him. I take 1g of valacyclovir daily (an antiviral that can be used to reduce the frequency and severity of OBs and get rid of OBs when you have them), lysine (an amino acid which counteracts arginine, which is something that hsv needs to replicate), and red marine algae (which reduces the frequency and severity of OBs). The antiviral is a prescription and so he may not have access to it or want to take it. The other 2 are supplements, so even if he doesn’t take them now, he may be willing to if you ask him :) ### I dunno where that other dude gothis information as he cited no sources, but I'll tell you my anecdotal. 

Caught it at 22. I had outbreaks back to back for an entire year with maybe an outbreak every two months for the following two or three years. Dropped down to four times a year after that. That's not necessarily in the downstairs, though - I have had outbreaks on my arm, my thigh (where I first contacted it with a partner I used a condom with every time,) and worst of all inside my nose, which is incredibly painful and embarrassing and it shows outside of my nose, too. Also in my anus. It can infect your eye and I'm shocked it didn't with me. 

12 years later I get them much less but oh boy when I do, they're pretty bad. Any time I've tried medication it makes it worse, so much fun. 

I'm behind what that other poster said - frivolous sex isn't worth it, but maybe we're just old. I had a kid with a guy I was in love with, but we split up, and so the idea of having a baby without a serious relationship sounds horrific. 

Now --- good points. I was dangerously promiscuous. I was on a route of getting into a scary mess of trafficking or death, who knows. I wound up with my kid's dad simply cause he had herpes and I wanted to get laid but fell in love. I'm able to educate tons of people, or used to when I had facts memorized. ### Stay away ### Hi- no outbreaks? Would you mind asking him what his igG value was at the time of testing? Curious to know as it could have been a false positive. ### Be up and front and honist with them if they love they will understand. ### Just saying you should ask for his igg levels, because there’s a 50 percent chance that it could be a false positive especially if he never had symptoms. Igg levels between 1.1 and 3.5 has a 50 percent chance of being false and the closer to 1.1 it is the higher the chance of false positive. Do some research and you’ll see. Or I could just link https://www.statnews.com/2017/01/26/flawed-herpes-testing-leads-to-false-positives/ ### This is a morally-based comment, but I don’t understand the draw of knowingly taking health risks with casual sex. I would not, in a million years, risk the future of my health just a hook up with somebody who I’m not exclusive with. 

Maybe I’m old now or something, but as a female especially, you can have sex with any guy you want. If you’re not emotionally attached to this guy and pursuing a relationship, why would you put yourself at risk in the first place? I don’t get it. ### Hey dude I’m not the OP I’m a 21M with a 19F sex partner who is HSV-2 positive. Is really appreciate this comment. Makes me feel a lot better about it. ### I’m curious where you get that study that condoms and valtrex reduce transmission that much. I read a study that condoms reduce transmission about 30% and the study with valtrex they used condoms in that study to get that 50% reduction in transmission. ### Wow, thanks. 

This post is amazing. ### It’s still contagious, it decreases over time, yes. But there is always a chance of spreading it to their partner. ### Thanks, and I appreciate your response but as I mentioned below I really don't see how I'm being ""frivolous"" about sex when I'm doing the complete opposite. I'm doing my research prior to making a decision to have sex with someone that I have a connection with and could potentially get more serious with. ### I actually don't feel super comfortable asking sorry, he's been really generous with sharing personal info around this so early on and this seems like a step too far for me :) ### This question is extremely unhelpful, judgmental, and you make a LOT of assumptions about my relationship with this person based on a few short paragraphs. I'm simply looking for more information as someone I'm dating disclosed, that's it. ### I’m not the OP, I’m a 21M who is HSV negative, with a 19F HSV positive partner

I didn’t find your comment to be attacking at all, and I personally found it quite helpful ### exclusivity/=/casual. polyamorous people exist. your comment is very discouraging. I also refuse to believe I have to give up casual sex bc I have a skin condition that 14% of the population has. ### i'll add that its far easier to spread from an infected penis to a vagina than the other way around. 1992 study found 17% males transmitted while 4% of females transmitted to their partners--cant recall if they used antivirals or condoms. i want to say they didnt. ### Well, in general, not specifically you, sorry, didn't mean any offense. (Lol I'm projecting probably considering my history ;P) ### Sorry if you feel attacked but nothing I wrote was judgemental in my opinion. My response can be summarized as follows: 

I don’t consider it wise to risk permanent health problems on somebody who isn’t even interested in a relationship with you. 

Seems like a helpful, thoughtful thing to say actually. So I’m sticking with it. ### Thank you kind sir. ### [removed] ### It's okay lol, was also projecting a bit by the conversation lower down in the thread ### I'm confused as to where I stated we aren't interested in a serious relationship. We JUST started dating, are not exclusive yet, and I want to take steps to educate and protect myself if we choose to make things physical soon. ### Except everything seems to suggest it’s not for a short-term fling but for a relationship. ### Comment removed due to misinformation.

>Risk with 2 sex acts a year is 5 percent with condoms and antivirals and 2.5 conservatively with both. M to F

Did you mean to say 2 sex act *per week* for an entire year? Because, otherwise, that statement is *way* off and grossly overestimates the risk. 

Even if you meant to say per 2 sex acts per week for an entire year, your stats are still a bit off. Here are the stats for male-to-female genital hsv2 transmission within the constraints stated. Note that it's important to specify the constraints when providing these stats:

---

**Male-to-Female Ghsv2 transmission risk:**

In studies of couples in long term relationships (ie together at least 3 months already) where the man has genital hsv2 and the woman doesn't and they both know he has it, if they have *unprotected* sex for an entire year (approximately twice per week) except during outbreaks, and the man takes no herpes medication, the woman has about a 10% chance of becoming infected by the end of the year.

Having sex more or less often than twice per week would raise or lower that base figure accordingly. Also note that that base figure comes from studies of couples already in long term relationships, and herpes is slightly more likely to transmit when the partners have been together less than 3 months. We aren't sure exactly *how* much higher the risk is before the 3-month mark, but we know its definitely higher. Herpes is also known to be more active when the infection is recent, most notably during the first 6-12 months of having it (the decline is gradual).

If the man takes daily herpes medication that would lower the risk to the woman by about 50%, bringing the annual risk from about 10% down to about 5%. Furthermore, condoms have been found to provide women with a very high level of protection from herpes, though not quite complete. One recent large scale study found that condoms reduce male-to-female herpes transmission risk by a further 96%. Herpes expert Terri Warren thinks that might be a *bit* on the high side, but not by much. So consider well over a further 90% reduction. So without condoms or medication, the annual risk to the woman is about 10%. With medication it falls to about 5%. With condoms but no medication it would be about 1%. And with medication *and* condoms it's well under 1%. ### Exactly - I'm not sure where it will go, maybe something serious, maybe not, but I think I'm being smart about this. We're both adults, and sexual compatibility is important to both of us in pursuing a relationship. I find the notion that I'm being frivolous about sex almost laughable when I'm actually taking things slow and doing my due diligence with my partner before we take things any further. I'm *choosing* to potentially engage in sex with someone I'm interested in, have chemistry with and who has been nothing but respectful and transparent. Can't think of better character traits I'd want in a partner. ### except the part where she said it’s an open relationship and she just thinks he’s hot…. ### Yes I meant to say per week. Still what I said falls in line with what you posted. ### Where did I say it's an open relationship? We're still getting to know each other and therefore not exclusive. And uh yes I don't think it's weird to say I'm physically attracted to someone I'm dating. ### You said you’re not exclusive. That’s literally what an open relationship is. 

I have no desire to continue this conversation. ### It's not...it's called dating. But okay :) ### open relationships are so different than being not exclusive. if you meet someone on tinder and go on a couple dates would you say you’re in an open relationship? id classify that as dating, but not being in a relationship. maybe that’s what OP is doing. ### Yep, this person clearly doesn't understand dating. If you go on a few dates with someone, it's way too early to commit to a serious relationship (at least for me). We're still getting to know each other at these stages, and part of that at some point will be sex. If things continue to go well and we both want the same things I could see myself being in a monogamous relationship with him. ### ",16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tes3d6/someone_im_newly_dating_has_hsv2_want_to_educate/

When they called they said I tested positive for exposure and to come back in three months and that was it. Just wondering what the odds are it could be hsv1 or a false positive. I’ve already come to terms with my results as is but just curious. Would be more upset to have had to go through the mental process of accepting this if it’s not what they have told me.,1,2022-03-15 22:27:39-04:00,">2.64 value for the Igg and they said hsv2. When they called they said I tested positive for exposure and to come back in three months and that was it. Just wondering what the odds are it could be hsv1 or a false positive.

An IgG test would not mix up hsv1 and hsv2. But they *can* sometimes report false positives. Your index value fell into the range where there's a substantial possibility of it being a false positive.

Statistically, the odds of an hsv2 index value of 2.64 being a false positive are probably around 40-45%.  

Here's a quote from herpes expert Terri Warren regarding an hsv2 index value of 2.68 having a 40% chance of being a false positive:

>So at an index value of 2.68, there is probably a 40% chance that this is a false positive. 

([Source](https://westoverheights.com/forum/question/2-68-results-for-herpes-2/))

Your index value is very slightly lower than that, and so may have a slightly greater likelihood of being false (the lower the value, the more likely to be a false positive) ### ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tf72yy/just_confused/

tf2dsf,"First Disclosure advice Hi everyone, I have read all the posts in here for disclosure ideas and transmission rates. And looked at the wiki links and guide. I got a positive (33F) HSV2 test in November IGG 6.0 and symptoms. My OB was very minor that my doctor didn’t even think it was Herpes. I did the blood test on my own. I’m on 1000mg Valtrex and take lysine daily. I haven’t had any other symptoms however , I know that doesn’t mean I won’t eventually. This also concerns me with my initial outbreak I didn’t feel anything as in tingling or itching. I just noticed some random bumps. I only went to the doctor because I’ve had shingles before but I know getting shingles in that area is really rare so wanted to get it checked out. I’m concerned I won’t be able to tell when shedding is happening without bumps ever appearing, any advice on that?

I’ve been seeing someone since January. Him and I have known each other for 2 years and had previously dated a year ago for 3 months but split due to our schedules and work travel. Now we are both home regularly and talked about trying again. We have not slept together currently only kissed. I plan on disclosing Friday. Honestly, I’m really not sure how he will react it’s a solid 50/50 chance he will nicely decline or be ok with it. I know he won’t judge or be disrespectful so there’s that. 

Should I keep the disclosure short and sweet or detailed? Should I go in depth with the facts right away or how I got it? Sorry, I just really don’t know how to approach this.

ter7n3,"I did it :) ghvs2 (f21) tw: SA/rape/violence

Hey guys!!! I’m so excited to tell you guys this even tho I’ve never posted or talked to any of you. I made an account just to tell you all about this.


So I was sexually assaulted last may and went to the hospital the morning after it happened (I was also stabbed and beaten really badly where my left side of my rib cage collapsed and had some head trauma)- had done a rape kit, the aids/hiv 72 hour thing, and regular std testing and was treated for my other injuries. I moved back home for recovery and when I was told my results at my home obgyn office they were clear. I went back to that office 4 times in the following six months for follow ups on my tearing, etc. I was really relieved and continued my healing journey- during this I wasn’t having sex with anyone, really isolated myself and just was really scared of sex and men in general, it really changed the way I viewed men and viewed sex and really how I viewed myself and my body and my sexuality really everything. Fast forward 6 months, the end of December/early January I noticed 3 raised white bumps on my left inner thigh/vaginal area. I called my obgyn and spoke to a nurse to ask some questions bc I didn’t know if this was a lady doctor issue or a dermatologist issue because I had never seen anything like this- I knew it wasn’t ingrown hairs but they weren’t blisters or ulcers and honestly I didn’t even think of it being herpes because I wasn’t sexually active since it happened and they had told me I was clear. While on the phone I was just describing exactly what I said and she replied “it sounds like you’re having an outbreak” at this time I had no idea what that meant so I said “outbreak? I don’t know what you mean” she then said “well in your chart it says you have herpes” I immediately freaked out repeating my name and birthday and asking her if she had the right person cause that can’t be right. No one told me in the 6 months I returned to that office multiple times. No one ever mentioned it. I had a great relationship with the nurses there and none of them had ever mentioned anything about it. I was crying on the phone and telling her that couldn’t be right. She was extremely apologetic and comforting she told me I would be okay and she’s so sorry no one told me and that this happened to me. I asked to schedule an appointment and to get retested to confirm. I just knew in my heart that I had it and was severely depressed the week leading up to my appointment. My mother went with me for support.


Long story short the assault gave me herpes. I was swabbed and it came back positive. I was really devastated. I was really hung up on the fact that no one told me. And not only that my doctor didn’t even think it was a big deal - he even recommended me not to tell anyone. Which I thought was fucked up. I got put on antivirals got some topical ointments and started researching what it was and I found this Reddit. I read the daily posts at 8pm every night when I got the Reddit notification. It made me feel so much better and like I wasn’t alone. The only person that knew was my mother- because she was there when I found out. 


I was struggling mentally to be quite honest. I’m already bipolar 2 and was recently diagnosed with PTSD. Not only did I have to remember this event for the rest of my life. But I now have to relive it every time I think about the fact that I have herpes because of it. 

During this time I had began seeing someone- I was finally feeling comfortable about men again, I was beginning to feel like my body was mine again and then i found this out. I hadn’t told him about the assault nor my new diagnosis. We would kiss and I’d spend the night sometimes and he would try to progress things forward but I always had the excuse that I was on my period or I wasn’t feeling well. I kept putting it off because honestly I didn’t know what to do or how to even begin telling someone - yet here I am telling the whole internet 😭- I had been doing this for about 3 months. I knew he would look at me differently I knew it would change things and that terrified me. He was the first guy I’ve felt comfortable with and I formed an attachment to since my assault. I remember when we first started dating we watched the juicewrld documentary and in the beginning they were clowning some guy joking about him having herpes- me being locked inside my head thought he would laugh but he really didn’t have any reaction. Fast forward 3 months later. 


Last night I went to see him bc he had just got out of the hospital from being sick this weekend. We were cuddling and he started trying to be intimate. I flat out told him “it wasn’t happening” he said okay and we went back to cuddling. I asked if he was mad at me and he replied “no why would I be mad?” And I just said I know how guys are — he could tell something was bothering me and he probably knew that something was up at this point I had been dubbing him for 3 months and asked me what was wrong I kept on saying nothing and he was like you can tell me. I just kept repeating I can’t I was legit terrified- I had begun crying by this point and I was trying to hide it terribly but I was trying to avoid telling him. I’d haven’t spoken about this to ANYONE. I had been sitting on this secret for months and was just entirely unsure about everything how to disclose if I should disclose right now or what. He then said “you’re eventually going to have to tell me-you should just tell me now” and I just knew it was now or never. He’s right I shouldn’t waste anymore of his time. 


I told him everything while crying and he held my hand. It was the most terrifying yet freeing thing I’ve ever done. He stayed quiet and listened to me tell the story. He just replied it’s okay while rubbing my hand, he even knew that you’re less like to transmit when you’re not having an outbreak. I educated him on everything I knew about transmission rates and everything and made sure he knew that the risk wasn’t zero. He was fine with it. He said that he was thankful I told him and we hugged I cried some more and we fell asleep cuddling.


He didn’t view me differently he didn’t treat me any different. He said “don’t you feel better now that you told me” and he was 1000% right. It was the first time in months I felt normal I felt comfortable I can’t describe to you how much lighter I feel. 


I can’t tell you your experience will be the same, but I figured posting this would help someone just like all the other posts helped me. There’s no way to know how they will react. But assuming the worst only hurts yourself. I was so locked in my head about this and I thought anyone I told would look at me like I was used, dirty, or gross. And that’s not the case. You are everything you were before your diagnosis or assault you are more than how people treat you. Having this doesn’t make you any less of a person or any less desirable. To my ladies you are beautiful and completely deserving of all love and care. To everyone in here - life goes on, there will be people who are understanding and will see beyond this skin condition. You are still a real person. You are still human and you deserve every bit of happiness this life has to offer. Sending everyone love and strength.

ter02z,"The right help makes a world of difference Diagnosed about a year ago. It was devastating at the moment and didn’t have to be. 
The “doctor” (using quotes because she does not deserve the implied respect of the title) who diagnosed me was awful. Shamed me, made me feel disgusting, physically recoiled, and left me in a flood of tears without the confidence to ask some much needed questions.
Lurked on this sub and tried to change my attitude. Found a bunch of remedies beyond prescriptions to manage my systems that truly made the world of difference over the past year. Helped me embrace myself again and find some of my old confidence.

Last week I finally made it in to a new office for a prescription (previous “doctor” ran out before I could process the diagnosis let alone get treatment)

The experience was night and day. She was kind, understanding, and incredibly helpful. I was finally able to have a discussion without tears. Now that I’m medicated my viewpoint is completely changed and I realize what a truly small inconvenience this is and just how overblown the stigma is.

I really just wanted to share my experience in case anyone else was made to feel less than bc of their diagnosis. Shamers are wrong and uninformed. Don’t let them stop you from getting help you need.

TLDR: shamed by my first “doctor” finally built up the courage to get actual help a year later.

I had a similar experience when I was first diagnosed in urgent care. Luckily there are real health practitioners out there who understand the virus and how common it is. I’m glad though that it did not break your spirit and you are more confident and taking care of yourself. Hugs! ### Thank you for posting this. I have recently been diagnosed with it and I’m heartbroken. Do you mind sharing the remedies that you found helpful?

Witch hazel works WONDERS I still plan on using it in the event of more flare ups. I got a bottle version I keep in reaching distance if my toilet and quickly soak a piece of toilet paper and wipe at the end of doing my business. In bad flare ups I’d dab to avoid being too painful. IMO this helps the sores clear faster. I had wipes I’d carry with me on bad days if I was going to be out for long times but I felt the wipes were too rough (and bad for the environment) for constant use. I also had a bidet (about 30$ on Amazon; easy enough to install) that I feel helped not cause further irritation. I’d start this process once I felt a flare up coming.

I would also take lysine supplements, specifically the Quantum Health Super Lysine+. My flare ups would be pretty bad and this worked better than the basic lysine but regular lysine may work for you. I tried to take this regularly but would often forget and start taking doses as soon as I felt the slightest tingle.

These combined dropped my 7-10 day AWFUL breakouts to a 1-3 day mildly irritating ones.

tf280o,Herpes and abnormal pap smear I am so scared/nervous. I got a pap smear last week and they called me today with the results and they had told me my pap smear was abnormal. Now I have to wait until May to get a follow up test for my pap smear. I am 26 years old is this normal. I am freaking out and I want to cry. Can having herpes be a reason as to why my pap is abnormal. I dont know what to think I am so scared.,21,2022-03-15 18:29:31-04:00,"Calm down :) 
Herpes can’t cause an abnormal Pap test. 
You also shouldn’t be scared because of the test results. The Pap test will tell you something about cancer or cell changes. You are in Group 3 I think.
Normally your immune system will fight against these. But you have to do the test every 6 months because if these cell changes will get really bad you can react really fast. 
I’ve had the same thing. It took 3 years and now they’re gone. My immune system won :)! ### No you can have a healthy vagina with herpes. Mine also came back abnormal in February. I also gotta wait the 6 months for a check up. ### I just went through this same thing, getting told my results came back abnormal, I was told that is common. I had my second Pap smear just over a week ago so well see, one thing that helped me was I would say to myself “I can think about it closer to the appointment.”, might not help you but who knows. It is a long time to wait but it’s easy to fixate on it, which doesn’t help sadly :( ### Get Gardasil 9 vaccine to prevent future other type of High risk HPV strain. ### As long as you don’t have HPV or diagnosed with HPV you’re gonna be ok. Once in a while we women will get an abnormal finding.

Same thing happened to me. I was diagnosed recently with GHSV2 through blood test and my Pap smear came abnormal. When I was diagnosed with herpes along with the abnormal Pap smear I spent one month none stop crying with high blood pressure, major anxiety and stress. All of this brought a shock to me so my reaction compromised my mental health and my physical health (no sign of OB tho just a lot of nerve pain and tingling). 

Took two weeks for them to reach out to me with the Pap smear and a few days to schedule another appt. They had to do a colposcopy and also an biopsy because they noted abnormal findings when they did the colposcopy. 

All in all after 4 weeks - I got my results and they came normal. 

Sometimes your cervix will have changes, especially if you had sex recently before getting your Pap smear. 

My findings were benign squamous cell tissues with blood and mucus debris, and benign endocervical glands. No sign of malignancy or dysplasia. In other words, NORMAL. And these cells WILL clear out on its own in few weeks. 

So don’t panic. You will have to go get another Pap smear every 6 months tho. ### Okay so yes, you can have herpes(HSV) cells show up on a Pap smear at the time of a current outbreak. But that is not the same as an abnormal Pap smear. Pap smears are specifically for the testing of cervical cancers and HPV. There are many types of HPV. Some cause warts and some cause cancer. Sometimes you can have an abnormal pap just due to stress or whatever so that’s why they repeat them. Herpes would not be an “abnormal” result call. They would tell you if they saw herpes cells. 

I recommend calling your provider and asking for clarification on your pap results and for them to explain it better to you. Sometimes doctors don’t realize that they need to explain things better.

Also try not to stress. I know it’s easier said than done. Abnormal paps happen all of the time. I’ve been scheduled for like 8 colposcopies and never had to actually have the procedure once they look with the magnifier. My paps were abnormal after having my babies. My paps have been abnormal randomly for no good reason. ### Yes i just went to the doctor yesterday and they told me the hpv strand they found in me was high risk ! I started crying on the spot i feel so fucking hopeless. I feel like i deserve this ### And its a colonoscopy but they said if they find anything abnormal they are gonna be taking pieces of my cervix 😭😭😭😭😭 ### The nurse also told me I tested positive for HPV. I thought genital warts can cause HPV? I may be wrong though. Did you also have an abnormal pap smear? ### Hpv probably caused the abnormality ### Genital warts are caused by a certain strain of HPV. I believe it’s a different strain of HPV that can cause cancer. ### Is the follow up for a coloscopy/biopsy?

HPV is what causes the abnormal pap.

Diagnosed with HPV in 2013, had the biopsy and was told it wasn't deeper. And haven't had an abnormal one since. 

Was a cervical cancer strain, so a bit more stressful.

Cervical cancer isn't the fastest spreading, so even if it's found deeper it can be treated/layers frozen off. 

However, it could be a more... Innocuous strain. 

There's debate if HPV is dormant or if the body actually rids itself of it. Which is not the best news. But is interesting, I suppose.

But the body is good at healing itself, especially when younger. ### Did you also test positive for HPV? If you did was there a second appointment you had to go through that was a little more invasive than a pap smear ? I forgot what the name for it was but thats what I have to get. Sorry for all the questions im just really scared. ### It's called a colposcopy. I also tested positive for the HPV strain that causes cervical cancer, and they identified abnormal cells on my pap. This was about 9 years ago. They did the colposcopy to biopsy the area that stains abnormally during the procedure, and honestly I wish I had done more research before agreeing to the procedure. A lot of HPV+ abnormal cells resolve on their own and the colposcopy was painful and invasive and completely unnecessary. The biopsy was negative, my pap was normal six months later, I've never had another abnormal pap and I don't even test positive for HPV anymore. ### No negative. I have my vaccine. No she just gave me an appt for another papsmear in 5 months ### What ?! Thats insane ! Was there something on your colpscopy that came back abnormal that they recommended that you get the biopsy?
Was the colpscopy really painful ??
And thank you for responding !!! ### The colposcopy is the biopsy. They insert the speculum, then apply a dye to your cervix that identifies the abnormal tissue. Then they chop out little pieces anywhere the dye indicates abnormalities. It hurt a lot and I cried the whole time. I fired that gynecologist later and filed a complaint with the licensing board, both for how she pushed the colposcopy, treated me during it (made a comment that suggested I deserved this for having sex), and her thoughts on a woman's purpose being to make babies. It was demoralizing and unnecessary. ### Oh my gosh im so sorry that happened to you that absolutely horrible and traumatizing!!! Thats so awful who does that ?!?!?!
But the nurse said im not getting a biopsy just yet she said there is another one before that one ? But i forfot what it was called :/ ### I had to look it up to remember all the details. The colposcopy is when they stain the cervix and surrounding tissue with the vinegar dye looking for abnormal areas. If anything shows abnormal, they biopsy right there. That hadn't been explained to me and they didn't ask or warn me that they were going to start cutting me up. ### What !??!? See they didnt tell me all that! They did not tell me if that came out abnormal they would cut me up right there! Omg :/ thank you sooo much for telling me this! I have to go talk to mt doctor more about this now! I legit would cry if they had to do the biopsy right then and there. Were you okay to drive home after? ### ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tf280o/herpes_and_abnormal_pap_smear/

tf47zc,"Warrior Spirit Says Hello To Other Warrior Spirits Hi all. 24y/o queer F/NonBinary. I've been following this sub for about 6mo after being diagnosed in April 2021 w GHSV1 or GHSV2 and thought it was time to say hello and share some. When I was swabbed they only told me I was HSV positive, and didn't specify which type even after I requested the specificity (most practitioners don't find this an important distinction). 

I had my first breakout directly after getting the covid vaccine, which sent my immune system for a whirl. I suspect that I contracted HSV from my current partner or the person that him and I had a 3sum with this last year. However, I noticed prodome/flu symptoms before the 3sum, and after seeing him exclusively. He only has had one oral outbreak that I am aware of and he broke out right after I broke out genitally for the first time. It is hard to understand who had it first and from where it originated. I have worked hard to not fixate on its origin, because such is energy demanding, but the past year of having this has caused me to face real suffering, met with little concern or support from partner who I am living with.

My symptoms post-outbreak #1 have been very mysterious, perception altering, and difficult to face on my own. I am going to share some of what I have felt in hopes to relate to someone or add to a wealth of knowledge. I haven't broken out into complete sores since the first time (which was around 3-4 sores total) but I have experienced intense viral/prodome? type symptoms back to back for about a year, basically spinning me into a fit of desperate/borderline hypochondriac investigation, going to tons of doctors visits and the er twice. The symptoms did not come with sores, so it was almost impossible to understand if something else was going on, or how a viral disease could wreak such havoc on a very healthy, young person. In 2018 my senses altered a bit after developing visual snow and POTS syndrome (due to combination of an eating disorder and compacted use of psychedelics (LSD specifically)) - some would refer to it as HPPD. Since then, the onset of herpes has caused my visual center to sort of hyperact - and what would for some be an intense anxiety attack, for me becomes a depersonalized hyperreality (imagine a high definition television screen plus static) with a very ""nowhere and no-one is safe"" type environment, especially my own body. The worst of this was brought on by a night of drinking and going out, which I cannot really do anymore. And since has decreased with further proximity away from the onset of this plus deep spiritual work to ground myself in this reality. More basic symptoms include - headaches, nausea, deep fatigue, chest pains/minor myocarditis, nerve discomfort/constant agitation, waves of light headedness/dizziness, lack of appetite, pain in lymph nodes in the groin, cramps, leg pain, and the accompanying anxiety/emotional distress that comes along with this. These symptoms will only really spread out a couple weeks at a time (seem to be in line with hormonal changes) and have varying degrees. Not all symptoms are always happening at once but sometimes they are. And when they reach a height, a small ""papercut"" type feeling appears genitally and quickly disappears. Herp saying whatsup player. 

I am very conscious of most knowledge on herpes, what to do and not do, and have altered my life to fit this accordingly. I am extremely healthy and active when this isn't defeating me. I use Chinese and herbal medicines generally and have tried a combination of things that generally haven't shown me true success yet. My current cocktail is B12, Liposomal vitamin C, L-lysine, the informal use of medicinal mushrooms (non psychedelic), herbal teas, and plant based diet with animal products infused. I've moved away from arginine rich diet recently and am drinking a ton of water, sleeping normally, and basically no drinking or staying out all night. Antivirals do basically nothing for me and I have read a lot about the benefits of letting your system fight on its own. I have support from family who live out of town and friends nearby. My mind is strong but this hurts me deeply. My biology is suffering. I get glimpses of how I used to feel every now and then and it pains me constantly to accept this new reality. I do it anyway.

tf3tun,"Am hoping to have some insight into my weird symptoms. I recently had protected sex and unprotected oral sex about 5 weeks ago. 

The morning after I did feel a little nauseous and dizzy but this could have been from drinking a few beers and not getting much sleep. 

4 days later I felt a slightly burning sensation on mainly one side of my shaft. Only when it brushed up against my underwear or squeezed against my leg.  The thing is I also sprayed tea tree oil in that spot. Diluted with water but now am aware that’s not enough. And it needs to be diluted with a carrier oil. This slight burning went on for a week. Went away. Then returned for a day or so. 

Later on I also felt a burning sensation on a different part of the shaft. And a sharp temporary sting in the same area two separate times.  I wasn’t sure if it was from pubic hair growing and poking the other side. But it felt a little too intense for that.  And also a slight sting in my urethra 4 weeks after the encounter. 

On and off the first two weeks I had a minor headache that would go away in a few hours. And a slight ache in my groin or thighs. And a feeling of restless leg syndrome in my legs at some point. But I’ve also been laying in bed depressed for a while so I thought it may be due to lack of movement. 

Also had an itchiness at the head of my penis and slightly down the shaft for two days about a week ago.. This almost felt like a yeast infection even though I’ve never really had one. I’ve had a small red dot on the side of the head for a month now that has not gone away at all as well. It looks like what balanitis would look like. But only one dot. 

Fast forward a week later and I noticed a small red quarter of an inch spot on the lower part of the shaft. With maybe a little blister on it. But incredibly hard to tell. I noticed this spot also in another location a week before. The second time it happened I showed it to my primary care doctor and even though it was barely visible he quickly said it’s probably herpes. This doctor has been quick to shame me about not using the proper protection though. So I honestly can’t tell if he’s just trying to scare me. And jump to conclusions. 

And it very well may be. But it has since pretty much disappeared in 2 days. I also put cream on it used for oral cold sores though. 

The girl I saw also admitted she does get cold sores. So I am wondering what my risks are. I got a blood test again at this 5 week mark. And I know that’s barely going to be 50% accurate. But I also had unprotected sex 9 weeks ago. So hopefully I can get some kind of answer. 

Also is it possible to spread genital herpes from someones hand to the penis?  
At this point I’m trying to just assume I have it so I’m not hurt too much by the results. 

But am confused that I have had on and off symptoms for a month. And no consistent ulcers. Only small red spots that come and go within a day or two.",9,2022-03-15 19:44:12-04:00,"If she gave you a BJ then yes there’s a risk. It’s low tho ### Hand to penis isn’t a risk..or vice versa. If the girl got cold sores it’s a chance you have hsv1g. Everyone has different symptoms. ### Small red spots that come and go within a day or two does not sound like herpes at all. 

All of the sexual activity you described has a low risk of transmission. 

And the rest of the sporadic symptoms you’ve had are not suggestive of herpes. 

I would plan on having a blood test, and then if you think you have an ulcerated lesion at some point—get that swabbed. 

But on the whole, almost nothing that is here sounds like HSV. 

Sorry that your doctor was heavy on the shame RE protection—yes. It’s important to use condoms. And that importance is hard to overstate—the main STI they protect really well against is HIV, and HIV rates are on the rise again globally among heterosexuals.

But I also think that your doctor stressing the importance of using condoms is in no way somehow evidence that you should be super anxious about this being HSV. 

Stay calm, get tested. I’d also recommend getting a test for a yeast infection and a UTI given some of the stuff you’ve been describing. ### You'd have to give a urine sample for uti symptoms. They test for white blood cells, bacteria, blood etc. Maybe ask for referral for dermatology to confirm yeast or fungal infection. ### Do you find these sporadic symptoms alittle odd ? I know it can show in many ways. But for it to drag on for so long. ### I also suspected a yeast infection. I only saw very small shiny spots and one red spot on the head. That’s been there for a month. 

I have found antifungal cream to help with the scratchy feeling. So I am hoping it’s that ?  

The doctor wasn’t very helpful though and quickly said it’s not a yeast infection. ### I wish I believed that. But I just read a post before of a girl who fingered another girl who has ghsv1 and then touched her self and got it.

Still hopefully you’re right ### My doctor told me there’s no way to test a man for yeast infection. 

And do you think a uti would be picked up on an std panel?  

And it wasn’t the shaming that made me stress about having HSV it was the fact that he looked at the small red spot and said confidently it looks like herpes. ### I did do a urine analysis but came back negative. I’ll look into a dermatologist for the yeast infection. Thank you. ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tf3tun/am_hoping_to_have_some_insight_into_my_weird/

I have hella acne, but I also haven’t been taking care of my skin as much due to depression, but my skin has never been this broken out.
 
It’s subtle but it’s enough for me to notice. I’ve been getting rashes on my legs. I developed seborrheic dermatitis on my face and scalp. 

Skin is way more sensitive all over. 

I developed that darkened line women get on their stomach when they’re pregnant.(Which would be impossible)

I’ve had recurring oral thrush and sensitive bleeding gums.

teqh95,"Satisfied to finally have gHSV-2 confirmed after being doubted by doctors. I **finally** had my genital herpes confirmed and wanna say ""I told you so"" to every medical staff I talked to about it.

TLDR; ranting/venting because nurses told me I probably didn't have herpes and now I've proved them wrong.

I was exposed in August of last year and had a three week period with \*very\* clear symptoms.  
Fast forward to two months later when I had the same experience but for two weeks and milder intensity. I've had sporadic symptoms on and off inbetween and after those periods, but never any outbreaks. Most docs and nurses I met said it wasn't herpes as I didn't have any blisters,  but couldn't tell me what it would be otherwise. But my symptoms were clearly there! And they wouldn¨'t test me only based on symptoms. I even had this doctor calling bullshit but still gave me aciclovir because I told her I ordered a home test kit and tested positive for type 1 and 2 antibodies.

Come January, I had two or three tiny and painful open sores on my labia. Can't remember if I felt any symptoms beforehand. I got them swabbed and it came back negative.   
Last week I found a similar tiny blister that hurt the same way, but not as much. The nurse questioned me at first as I hadn't felt symptoms this time. She also doubted it because there was only one bilster that ""didn't look like herpes and it would've been *sooo* painful if it were."" I asked her to swab it anyway to at least rule it out and made a point of how much the herpes thing initially tore me apart mentally. She finally did it and **tadaa!** Got the letter today that said I had tested positive for HSV-2. TOLD YOU!

Thank you for coming to my HSV talk.",4,2022-03-15 10:38:56-04:00,"Getting the diagnosis after all of that run around sounds like a relief to finally have a concrete answer. I’m sorry they didn’t take your concerns seriously. Not all outbreaks are a blanket “this many blisters and this much pain” so shame on them.

teoboy,"Disclosing tonight but I've left it very late I'm travelling today to meet someone I've been talking to for a while and have met up with already a couple of times. I'm just wishing I had disclosed sooner! He went away for work and is away for a couple of months so invited to me stay with him whilst he's away. I wanted to ring him and talk about it on the phone but also I've always disclosed in person and find it easier to do so that way. He's also been extremely busy with his job. So now I've got to wait until I get to his hotel and go out with him tonight to tell him and he probably thinks sex is definitely on the cards because we've met up a few times and had a bit of a fumble last time we hung out. I should have probably said something then but I knew it wasn't going to go further that time so I didn't.

After flirting all night we got back to the hotel and he said he didn't want me to feel pressured just because we are in a hotel. I said I don't feel pressured and I love sex but before I can do anything I feel the need to disclose the fact I have hsv type 2 which causes herpes... he was like aw thanks for telling me, you are cute. Told him im on antivirals plus with a condom transmission rate is relatively low and he said ok cool. And then proceeded to have amazing sex :)

He is so lush. I'm feeling pretty happy right now hehehee ### Have you discussed sti testing at all ? Do you know his sti status , hsv incl. ? ### OMG! I could have written this post myself. I will be talking to him on Thursday and staying at his house until Saturday. We've hung out for a good while over the past 2 weeks, and I should have brought up the past couple of days before I left. We haven't had sex, but I know it's coming and need to talk now.

Yep agreed, feel like we are closer now but in a way that has made it even harder to disclose, I'm just hoping he is understanding of why I was nervous not to do it sooner.

Good luck with your situation and yes I will do <3 ### I updated it- it went very well. We just had sex again lol ### I believe disclosing is correct thing, but wonder why people with hsv are always the ones who need to go first considering the other person could very likely have it too and just not know it and assume they are negative ?  When I’ve talked with friends and asked who actually knows and has been tested the answer is almost none. ### It is very annoying but I was one of those people once upon a time! I'm in the UK and herpes is not regularly tested for, only if you have symptoms. My doctor even told me not to bother disclosing unless in a relationship as the stigma is worse than the actual virus... I actually only became more educated due to this subreddit,  I would have known fuck all without it which seems crazy to me! ### Not sure if it’s tested for anywhere without asking & paying.

Because i wanna die now but my life is too precious, i love my brother too much to leave him here without me, so its even more painful i have to live with this, i dont find myself ever accepting this or loving myself the same, i want to model and do high fashion and be an actress, but i feel dirty and tainted💔i cant live my life past herpes, sorry for the rant as its the only place i can talk about it ive only told my brother but i dont wanna depress him because im miserable, so i feel sooo soooo so alone i cry so much because i miss so many people💔💔",24,2022-03-15 04:25:42-04:00,"Herpes isn’t limited to ugly people. Why are you putting so much emphasis on how attractive you are? Do you think this mindset may have something to do with how hard you’re taking your diagnosis? It’s fine to be confident, but resorting to “I’m too hot to have herpes” is an unusual take and shows you may have deeper rooted issues than having herpes. You’re worth more than what you have to offer sexually, and I imagine a lot of these people you consider “not in your league” that you “have to settle for” are worth more than you give them credit for as well. ### M23 here. Currently dating a F23, she is lovely. Your diseases doesn't define you, but your person does. By limiting yourself, you're missing out on all the opportunities that lies ahead.   


Before I dated this F23 she was in two relationships. Where they know she had herpes. And I would say we're all 3 quite good looking, so your standards doesn't need to be lower. You just need to focus on you as a person and not as something people can't love or adore. ### I thought my life would never be the same, and I was emotionally destroyed after my diagnosis.

But now, 1-2 years later, I’m literally 100% over it.

More people have herpes than those who don’t, and it’s just like any other skin condition. I get bad rashes on my head and I have to use cream daily and I’ve never been ashamed or held back by that. Why is herpes any different? 

Trust that you will be fine soon ❤️ When I read people saying that, I didn’t believe them, but it’s true. ### Maybe this is a wake up call to analyze the people you surround yourself with. Real friends will educate themselves and support you during this time of accepting yourself. Be realistic. You are just a baby and have a whole life ahead of you. I know it’s daunting in the beginning but it gets better. Trust and believe this is the time for you to heal your mind and body. Make healthier lifestyle changes and choices. Be aware of what you are letting into your life like hurtful thoughts, people etc your body is still a temple. Don’t disrespect it because of how others made you feel. Love yourself so much that you will attract the right people. And please work on your mindset. Life doesn’t stop because of herpes. It is so common and there are so many good people out there who still live perfectly normal lives post diagnosis. Don’t use it as an excuse to not fulfill your dreams. It’s not a death sentence. You’re not handicapped. You can still do all of those things. ### i feel you. I knew i shoudnt have based so much of my personality on being young, hot, and fuckable, but i did. now i dont feel like those things. i try to reframe it like this: i can still dance, flirt, and chat up people. i can side eye someone across the room. its not like im inviting them to sex right then and there.  from what i hear attractive young women have no problems picking up dudes. im still in my first OB so i cant attest personally, but it seems like its all about being confident (just like in the Before Times!). IDK about you, but i value my promiscuous personality more than i value the sex i get from it. still, the sex will come, especially after this first year is over with. you are still you. 100%. you can do everything you wanted to do before this diagnosis, just gotta do this extra step of disclosing & taking precautions. talk to the people you miss. dont isolate yourself. thats the worst possible thing you can do. ### I feel you 100% I feel I am an attractive fine ass woman, and like you, I get a lot of unwanted attention from men. I just disclosed for the first time last night and it went well. I know you’ve had a bad experience. But You’ll never know how they’ll react - trust your judge of character and tell people you think will be understanding - I know that’s tough to judge and I’ve only disclosed once, but from reading other womens disclosure stories that gave me strength. Start working on yourself and look beyond your diagnosis to find confidence within yourself and as you get more comfortable with you im sure you will find comfort in disclosing to the right people. Sending you love and light! You got this :) ### I know the feeling. It will smoothly fade and you will feel back normal because you will find out lots of info that will calm you and everything will be okay I promise. I thought i was doomed because I read this sub and heard what panicking people say, but it will be okay soon I promise. Educate yourself and you will understand it’s not a big serious problem. Jessica Alba, Scarlet, Usher, Kim Kardashian and lots of famous successful people have hsv. ### you will be fine the disease dosent define you. no matter what you look like you will find ppl dont care about it.. i hope the days get better for you and if you ever need an ear chats always open! cheers. ### Hey I understand the depression I was depressed for years until I finally decided enough was enough. I have been diagnosed for 10 years and have had  20+ partners since diagnosis. None of them to their knowledge have genital herpes some had cold sores. I am currently with a guy who is completely HSV negative he works at a blood lab and took a test just for shits and giggles.  He knows about my herpes I disclosed and he is completely fine with it and accepts the risks. There are plenty of people like this who do not care. Sitting around and waiting for a cure it’s silly you’re rejecting yourself before anyone even has a chance to think about it or reject you or accept you. You are putting limits on yourself before giving anyone else the opportunity to consider anything. People get rejected every day for a plethora of different reasons Sure there are people who ghosted me especially on tinder but as I talked to my friends I realized they got ghosted too and it wasn’t because of herpes it was because dating apps are cesspools in general. Dating nowadays sucks for so many reasons if you want to pin it on herpes go for it but that’s not the only reason. I was diagnosed with ghsv-1 at 19 and I thought my life was over I didn’t tell a soul cut off friends and everything because I felt so disgusting and gross. But eventually I put myself out there and had a few positive disclosure s and i began to realize that I was the one creating the stigma for myself.. The more people I told the less it weighted me down. Think of it logically friends should care because it doesn’t effect them. The only people your herpes effects are the people you are sleeping With. Friends are supposed to be your support system and if you tell them your story they should not judge you And they will learn from you And your experience. Hell you May even help a fellow herpes person out becuase if someone discloses to your friend after you teach them about herpes they will be more understanding and knowledgeable about it.

But you sound like a strong person, PPD is awful and you had the strength and courage to pull yourself out of it and come out stronger than before. Obviously this setback with the herpes sucks but you’re still the same person who worked so hard to get where you are, I have a feeling you will persevere and come out loving yourself just like you have before. ### Well boys at the age of 19-25 can be quite the handfull. Pretty sure you just meet some fuckheads (May I swear on reddit I'm new to this) 😉

You're mentioning anxiety pills, and it's completely okay to be scared, angry and sad when things occur. But it's not that life changing! You are still you! Boys who found you attractive before will still now.

It was usually just a burning/ intense itching on the inside of my vagina but it would subside for a couple days and return a week later. only once have a ever gotten one of the little bubbles that look like pimples and with my luck it popped up right on the skin above my clit :). 

my symptoms have gotten so bad that i can’t focus on anything. i can’t walk around for too long. i can’t sleep. i sometimes have to call out of work/ leave early because the pain and itching is so intense. I’m pretty healthy and in good shape. i try to avoid anything that’ll stress me out because i think that’s a trigger although it’s hard to tell since i have them so frequently and the last so long. my last outbreak lasted from august to november and before that it was a constant thing.

i’m currently pregnant and i don’t know if the hormones are making it worse or something but i desperately need to figure out a way to keep this under control. the pain has become a very serious problem for me and it’s taking a toll on my quality of life. i know that might sound dramatic but i have a very low threshold and i’m already hormonal as all hell. 

thanks x",13,2022-03-15 16:24:54-04:00,"Hey sorry you’re going through this, outbreaks shouldn’t last that long, it could be something else? Have you gone to the doctor about it? And before you got pregnant were you ever on antivirals daily? Also, your skin can get a lot more sensitive while you’re pregnant. ### Have you been tested for yeast? ### Hormones are deff a trigger for alot of people I would deff talk to your dr. There could be a lot of other things besides herpes that could be effecting you. UTI , yeast infections or bacterial infections and a lot of times that will trigger an out break. I’ll attach  the outbreak guide I put together after talking to the support group and a bunch of redditors it’s all info how to shorten and lessen outbreaks and deal with particularly painful sores. But deff talk to your dr before making any major changes 

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w0nbGEJuiRHgKUb4DjZQALX3vWA26MBZA7lhDmsHlbo/edit ### Your symptoms sound very unlikely to be herpes. Herpes simply would not cause discomfort as intense as you describe in the absence of visible symptoms in the same areas. Nor would it cause symptoms that persist for as long as you describe, or as often as you describe, especially in the absence of visible symptoms. This is extremely unlikely to be a herpes issue.

Yeast infections and fungal infections (aka ""jock itch"") can cause the sort of chronic symptoms you describe. In some cases, yeast can even cause small sores/blisters. Fungal infections, meanwhile, can sometimes cause visible symptoms where it looks like the very top layer of skin as been scraped off, similar to when you fall off your bike and skin your knee -- where just the very top layer of skin if affected. I obviously can't say for sure whether you have a yeast or fungal infection. But this is extremely unlikely to be a herpes issue. ### hi! i went on valacyclovir for a month or two but it nothing for me. i have an appointment with my doctor today and hopefully i can’t talk to her about putting me on a different antiviral. ### thank you this is super useful! i’m talking to my doctor soon about what i can do medication wise. ### hi :) thanks for the feedback. i used to get yeast infections in high school and they felt nothing like this. and the discharge i had was more thick whereas the “discharge” that im currently experiencing/ have experienced during previous flareups are more milky. i also used things like Monistat and other remedies for yeast infections and they only made it worse. that was before i was diagnosed. i’m not really sure how to go about treating it if it is a fungal infection because i’m afraid treatment will only make it worse. ### I hope you get it under control! Do you get any blisters  at the moment or just pain and itching? You have a higher chance of recurrent thrush when you’re pregnant so it could be that too. Did the doctor help at all? ### It sounds like a trip to the doctor might be warranted, don't you think? 

Herpes would not cause milky discharge. The only kind of vaginal discharge that herpes would cause would be clear and very watery/runny. And the only possibility for it to occur in any substantial quantity is during a primary outbreak that starts within 2-10 days of becoming infected. The discharge is caused when a considerable number of herpes lesions occur inside the vagina and/or on the cervix. The lesions cause some cell walls to break down, and the cells to rupture and spill out their watery contents. That's what the discharge is.

And again, numerous other aspects of your symptoms are not suggestive of herpes either. ### i haven’t gotten a blister so far and i’ve only ever gotten one on the two-ish years i’ve had it. it’s mostly pain and itching. and as far as the appointment goes, i couldn’t find my insurance card and couldn’t afford to self pay. i had to reschedule for next week. i do think i narrowed down some triggers though. I struggle with anxiety and lately it’s been really bad so sometimes I don’t sleep for a day or two and then sleep for an entire day after. my body is exhausted but I also can’t fall asleep so I usually just drink two or 3 cups of coffee (with oat milk) a day. I know it’s really unhealthy but at the time I wasn’t aware I was pregnant and I didn’t realize that not taking care of my body would trigger a flareup. ### Just came back from my doctors appointment. I asked about wether it’s a fungal infection or a yeast infection and she told me it’s not either. she told me that since i’m super sexually actively it’s making it worse because i’m not giving my vagina time to recover from the flareups or something. i also just have a bunch of triggers i didn’t know i had before that make it so much worse. ### Oh ok, yes lack of sleep and stress can definitely be triggers but good that you’re not getting blisters with your symptoms. I hope the doctor can get to the bottom of it. ### >I asked about wether it’s a fungal infection or a yeast infection and she told me it’s not either.

So did she tell you what she thinks it *is*?

> she told me that since i’m super sexually actively it’s making it worse because i’m not giving my vagina time to recover from the flareups or something.

Right, but what is ""it""? What is the underlying condition that she thinks is causing the symptoms? Because herpes would not cause ""about a year and a half being in constant pain and itching"", not matter how much sex you're having. Herpes simply doesn't work that way. Nor would herpes cause milky discharge under any circumstance. So what does she suspect the underlying condition is, that she's claiming you're exacerbating by being very sexually active?

If your doctor is suggesting this is herpes then I would suggest you consider posting on herpes expert Terri Warren's online clinic forum. Terri has a 35+ year career researching and treating herpes specifically. There is a US$20 fee to post on her forum but she will answer your post personally and she is far more knowledgeable regarding herpes than doctors in general practice. And she is a recognized expert on the topic as opposed to an anonymous internet stranger like myself. But again, unless I'm misunderstanding something about your situation, this sound very unlikely to be herpes and much more likely to be something else.

No, having an outbreak does not speed antibody development. If a person has herpes then they will develop antibodies whether they experience outbreaks or not. And whether they experience outbreaks makes no difference to the rate of antibody production. ### Thank you for the insight! ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tey04k/how_soon_after_exposure_did_you_test_positive/

tejbcv,"Pap smear detected herpes So Im going this week for blood work, but I’ve been freaking out since I got my Pap smear. My Pap smear came back that I have a cell change consistent to herpes, and BV and a yeast infection also epithelial cell abnormality.. when my ob told me that I began to freak out and I told her so does that mean I am positive or not. She said no it means you MAY have herpes not to worry Bevause it could be l because I had so much going on down their it could have caused inflamed cells. I went and got checked at planned parenthood hood a week later and they checked and said they seen no sign of a outbreak and also not to freak out and could have been that the Pap smear detected just some abnormal cells. I just want to know if anyone out there has been through the same thing and turned out fine? I’ve never had an out break or experienced any sort of symptoms my daughters father cheated on me so I’m super scared.. and now I feel like every little itch or abnormal feeling is an outbreak and my mind is everywhere. 

Also keep in mind when getting my Pap smear, I had sex with a new partner the day before my pap, I had a yeast infection BV and also had monistat medicine in my vaginal area and basically so much..",35,2022-03-15 03:19:01-04:00,"Never heard of a Pap smear detecting HSV but this may be new to me. It’s worth tagging the mod & see the response. I would recommend getting an iGG blood test at this point & see what that comes back with. ### I legitimately don’t know why I’m getting downvoted for sharing my lived experience on how I was diagnosed. But ok. ### [deleted] ### Hello when i had my first outbreak of herpes, i had fever and muscle soreness. It hurt when i peed because the sore / outbreak blister was hit by my pee. Check your vag for any blisters. 

I get my routine pap smear and i saw that it also had a herpes portion. Mine was negative at the time because i didnt have any outbreaks ### My herpes was diagnosed via Pap smear. A lot of folks have internal OB without even knowing. The herpes cell change under a microscope is pretty obvious to the lab and doesn’t look like hpv or any of that. My bloodwork showed positive for GHSV about a month later. My pap with the herpes indication was suspected to be my first OB so it took a little bit for my antibodies to climb. 

You should request bloodwork to check. I’m honestly surprised your OBGYN would dismiss that on your pap and not look into further work up to rule it out. ### Maybe you’re confusing hsv and hpv? Pap smears are done to check for human papilloma virus (hpv) which is the leading cause of cervical cancer. ### I would wait a couple months and then get a herpes IGG test, it takes some time for antibodies to form after you contract herpes (in case this was a first outbreak which in your case you probably don't know)

If you went a week later and they didn't see anything it's possible it was because your outbreak healed already, people can have internal outbreaks and not realize it ### I am not sure but it was not me thank you for sharing !!! I am freaking out but thank you.. I appreciate it! ### So first swabbed showed a possible positive? And then when you went back it was negative ? ### Sorry for so many questions but was it a Pap smear? ### Never have I had any sort of out break & I also had BV & yeast infection. I did scratch for a day n Still there was no out break. & when I went to planned parenthood I showed her my results from my obgyn n she told me that I wasn’t specifically tested for it and she said from what I explained it doesn’t even sound like an outbreak :/ ### It was no more than a week later that I got another Pap smear at planned parenthood and the provider  checked for any sore blisters or signs of blisters and she told me I was completely clear that’s why I was super confused.. and I agree my doctor was no help.. answered none of my questions.. ### Your blood work doesn’t show ghsv , it will only show hsv 1 or hsv2 .  It will not actually show ghsv which is just the location of the hsv. 

Did the pap smear tell you which OB you were having. Problem I have read is a pap would only be able to identify hsv is it happened to be performed when you were having an actual OB or a time of viral shedding ( which isn’t continuous ). ### But could it heal that fast if it was my first time? But true it’s been a month so i think I’m going to go today ### I just think everyone should be informed. It’s not always a one size fits all situation with finding out if you have herpes genital/oral/type 1/type 2. Im very pro health advocacy and you know yourself best. I hope you get answers and I know it’s easier for me to say it but really, try not to stress. Bloodwork for peace of mind. Everything will be ok ❤️ ### Wait for your next outbreak if any, to confirm ### I would request bloodwork
For peace of mind for sure. ### It’s not difficult to put two and two together when the positive hsv2 in my bloodwork coincided with herpes cells in Pap smear along with a subsequent external OB…

I’ve had ghsv2 for nearly 10 years. So I’m pretty secure in knowing the type I have with how it presented and how it was diagnosed.

Edit to add: I am sharing my experience. My experience and steps for testing may not be everyone’s experience. But this is how I found out and because of that, I’m sharing for awareness. ### Yep mine healed in a few days 

I'd wait at least 2 to 3 months from the pap to get a blood test, anything before 3 months will likely result in a false negative ### My doctor doesn’t want to send me to get blood work /: she said come back IF I have a flare up or break out. She said that there’s no proper blood work for it. ### Ghsv can be either Hsv1 or 2.  Some people do not realise that both strains can effect both oral or genital areas so it’s good to be clear on what you are referring to. 
And you didn’t actually say you had tested positive for hsv2 you said ghsv.  You may know what you have and are referring to but others who are just finding out they are positive or potentially positive do not. ### Yeah my doctor doesn’t want to send me for blood work she said to come back to the doctor’s IF I have a flair up or outbreak.. ### Honestly specifying type 1 vs 2 genitally in my comment is a moot point. Regardless of type, herpes cells are herpes cells if they are on the cervix, there is a high likelihood of having a form of GHSV because the cervix is in your genitals. Therefore additional testing is the next step that makes to most sense to confirm if it is actually cells from ghsv and if it’s type 1 or 2. ### Wow. Did you see the physical report from your pap where it states the suspicions of HSV? I’d be finding another doctor. They should not refuse that test. ### Yea medical professionals love letting you live in an ""ignorance is bliss"" state when it comes to herpes 

Wait for about 12 weeks from the pap and go to a STD testing center, Planned Parenthood or whatever you have available where you live that doesn't require your doctor's referral. Get tested. You'll have peace of mind and it'll be good to do it to protect future partners


Edit to add : while blood work(antibody tests- IGG) for herpes can sometimes miss infections it's better than not getting tested at all ### So to clarify. My order of diagnosis was 

Suspicious HSV cells on pap >bloodwork: HSV1 negative, HSV2 equivocal >repeats labs several weeks later HSV1 negative, HSV2 positive igg 8.60 >subsequent first visible external outbreak after positive labs several weeks later.  = GHSV2 ### Yeah I’m pretty upset! And I am going Thursday to get a copy of all my medical records and switching doctors because how could you allow your patient to be overwhelmed and confused.. ### That’s a good idea I’m going to look for places I can get tested with out my doctors referral I also want to know so I can let my last partner know so he can make the right choices as well and be safe.. ### So your positive for HSV2. They did the igG test.

** sorry, thought your response was from OP ** ### You can also order tests online at let'sgetchecked or stdcheck whichever one is available in your country, and you just go to a lab to have them draw the blood ### Yes. In my original comment I mentioned that the first notification of having HSV was because of the pap results saying present HSV cells. That was the start of my diagnosis. My blood tests then confirmed that it was hsv2. So I am diagnosed with GHSV2 and the first indicator of this was because my pap showed the cells at the time of my swab. The repeat labs being equivocal the first round and then showing an igg at 8.60 for hsv2 is indicative of me having my first outbreak at the time of my pap and then it took about a month or so for enough antibodies to register on my 2nd round of bloodwork. 

This was a routine pap that I did annually along with my normal STD testing. ### Interesting. I would have never though they could do that during a Pap smear. Always good to learn new things! ### Oh they don’t look for it but when there are changes or abnormal findings the person running the results will make note of it. So to just clarify, Paps are primarily a screening tool to detect hpv and cervical cancers. It just so happened to be my luck the I had HSV and it was like “hey you see me over here too, right!?” ### A, i see. 
Even more interesting. Hell, if it wasn’t for the blood I would have never known I had HSV. ### Right! That’s why it’s wild that it’s not a part of routine testing. My husband gets tested annually and they always give him a hard time when he requests it. He only can by telling them that his spouse has diagnosed gHSV2 and that he’s exposed to it regularly. ### ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tejbcv/pap_smear_detected_herpes/

I would think at that point, taking antivirals is pretty overkill since even on those 4 days, your body has an extremely low chance of producing a virus strong enough to even infect or transmit.

tehlsl,"Feeling torn. Looking for information (and advice) This is a throwaway account because I am in a situation that I never expected to be in, my emotions have been all over the place, and I need to talk frankly about the situation but I really can't get advice from people IRL. This will be a long post, so here goes.

I'm a 21-year-old Christian woman and I just starting dating a 24-year-old guy who, while not actively religious himself at the moment, was raised in the same religion as me and understands and respects my choice to remain celibate until marriage. (I only bring up the religion thing to provide an explanation as to why we haven't engaged in sexual activity yet). We've been seeing each other for about six weeks and made it official two weeks ago. He was my first kiss and he's my first boyfriend so I don't really know what I'm doing, but I know I really like him and I don't want to break up with him.

Last night, he was driving me back to my apartment after we had a really great evening together, when he got really serious all of a sudden. He said he had something he needed to tell me. It took him a few minutes to say it because he was trying not to get too emotional, but basically he contracted genital herpes about two years ago. He says that the symptoms are mostly entirely managed now and he takes medicine for it regularly, but that this is something that he'll have the rest of his life. He told me that if this is something that is a dealbreaker for me, he wants me to break up with him now rather than later when we get even more emotionally attached to each other. He said he would accept whatever I chose, and that I could take a few days or even weeks to come to a decision. 

I really appreciate that he would disclose this to me, but I've been in tears on and off all day whenever I try to think about the situation. To clear my head, I just decided to learn more about herpes so I can make a truly informed decision. I know that there's a degree of ""following your heart"" that needs to happen in making relationship decisions, but I also want to know what the facts are and I'm struggling to find the statistics about how contagious herpes is and how many people with herpes have severe symptoms. 

So far I'm able to find demographic statistics about how widespread herpes is (way more common than I expected!) and I've also learned that many if not most people with herpes have no symptoms at all (which was also surprising to me--just goes to show you how stigmatized herpes really is), but I'm having trouble finding clear statistics about transmission rates based on a variety of factors (condom usage vs unprotected sex, gender, length of time since infection, whether or not sores are present, etc.). A comment under an old post in this subreddit gave me a bit of hope that this ""highly contagious"" virus wouldn't necessarily be something I'd be guaranteed to contract on the honeymoon, as I had previously thought ([https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/lub00d/comment/gppz33y/?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/lub00d/comment/gppz33y/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)[utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/lub00d/comment/gppz33y/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)). But I'm having trouble finding what study this user is referring to.

I know that if we ever got to the point where we were seriously considering marriage, I would need to come to terms with the fact that I'll probably get infected at some point. So even though we're a long way from that level of commitment, I'm worried if I decide to stay with him, I'll be essentially risking my own sexual health and the health of any kids I would want to have. But if I leave him now, I'm worried I'll be losing a potentially fantastic life partner over a condition that would actually be super manageable down the road. We're obviously early enough in our relationship that there could be plenty of other reasons we break up before we even have sexual contact, but I agree with him that it would be best to make a decision now about this particular issue.

If anyone has information (i.e., statistics and studies) that would be applicable to my situation, I would appreciate the reference. I also welcome general information about herpes, anything that would be good to know when interacting with someone who has disclosed that they have herpes. I want to make a thoughtful decision so the more I know going in, the better. Finally, I know this isn't r/relationship_advice but if anyone on this sub has been in a similar situation or has advice for this woefully inexperienced girl, I'd like to hear other people's opinions but I can't go around telling my IRLs about my boyfriend's herpes, so anecdotes and advice here are also welcome. Please don't sugarcoat anything.

TLDR: If a (female) virgin marries someone (male) who has herpes but it's been years since he contracted it and the symptoms are manageable, what are the odds that she will a) eventually contract it and b) have severe symptoms?",6,2022-03-15 01:23:30-04:00,"I'm going to paste nearly verbatim what I wrote to a woman earlier this week.

It's important to know which strain he has because if it's HSV1 you very well likely have it and will be protected from ever getting it genitally (2/3 of the population has HSV1 or oral herpes). I am going to assume it's HSV2, but if it's HSV1, the rates of transmission are MUCH lower.

I'm a 29M and have had HSV2 for over three years. HSV2 commonly affects the genitals but can be oral as well; HSV1, while preferring the mouth, is responsible for up to half of new genital herpes infections. I've had a total of four outbreaks (all in the first year). I haven't had any outbreaks since. This is how it is even for a vast majority of people that get this. Over 80% of people that contract HSV2 NEVER have ANY symptoms and are out there spreading this because they have no idea they have it. An estimated 1/6 Americans have HSV2.  For those who have symptoms at first, the outbreaks decrease with severity and amount and eventually will cease entirely. Most of the horror stories on here are the exception, not the rule - I would say probably 5-10% of the people who get herpes are likely immunocompromised and suffer recurrent outbreaks - which can easily be managed with antivirals. It is, as is often described, a skin infection - one that doesn't decrease your lifespan or really affect your ability to have children (neonatal herpes being passed through childbirth is 3 times less likely than you giving birth to a child with down syndrome).

Having this myself, I can say that this is NOT a big deal at all and I do not get the stigma surrounding it. That's really the only problem IMO about having this - others' assumptions and stereotypes about the infection. I will say this - of course, for a guy, the symptoms aren't as painful because if we do get sores, they tend to be outside versus inside. It's very possible you already have it or HSV1. Ironically, if this guy ONLY has HSV2 and didn't ever have HSV1 and you did, YOU could have given him genital herpes. I am in this boat, I tested negative for HSV1 when I got tested a few months back for my HSV negative partner.

If you all have 2-3 sex acts per week, there is about a 10% chance of you acquiring the virus in a given year (this is without protection). Again, if you contract it - there is an over 80% chance you never get ANY symptoms. Daily antivirals reduce the chances to about 5% per year. Condoms, conservatively, reduce the chances by another 50%; however there is research by Teri Warren that shows condom use may reduce transmission rates from M to F by up to 96%. Conservatively, the use of antivirals AND condoms will result in a 2.5% yearly chance - but we may be talking well under 1% due to condom use with antivirals. Oral with HSV2 is generally safe as it does not like the mouth area, but is still possible (but under 1%); use a condom at first if you're not comfortable. Also, the longer he has it, the less he sheds the virus. If he's asymptomatic (doesn't have outbreaks anymore) this also leads to a reduction in overall shedding. People without symptoms shed less on average than those that still get outbreaks. Asymptomatic shedding (with no sores) IS responsible for up to 70% of transmissions, so YES, that IS possible, but again, this is hindered by taking daily antivirals and condoms.

The vast majority of us on here that got it (90%+) was NOT from someone who disclosed and was honest with us; it was from someone who didn't know they had it OR KNEW AND LIED/NEVER TOLD. I was in the second boat; my ex-girlfriend knew she had it and didn't tell me out of fear I would have rejected her. If she had told me, I would have not have rejected her; her being honest with me and showing me all the precautions would have been a massive green flag for me and by taking those precautions I VERY LIKELY would not have it today.

For the few that have contracted it after taking the risk and when given the choice, the anecdotes I've seen from people is that they didn't contract it until years into the relationship - which at that point I would imagine most people are happily married and don't care anymore.

This guy is presumably looking for a long-term relationship and by telling you this is communicating his desire to be honest with you, even with the chance that you turn him down as a result. Clearly, he's not looking to lie to you or mislead for the possibility of cheap sex; so many people pass this on or lie about it just to get laid. Consider that a MASSIVE GREEN FLAG.

Still, if you're hesitant, I recommend taking it slow with him and getting to know if you two are compatible. Sex is good, sex is great; but I'm taking it slow with a woman who is HSV negative right now because I desire so much more. Sounds like he does too.

***PS - You just said you want to remain celibate until marriage? Sounds like this decision is all the easier for you. You're not risking anything till then, at which point you should know whether or not this is the guy for you.*** ### Do you know which *type* of genital herpes your guy has? Genital herpes comes in two types: hsv1 or hsv2. The type of genital herpes that a person has plays a big role in the degree of transmission risk there will be. ### I'm so touched that you took the time to write such a thought-out comment (even if it was mostly pasted from an earlier one as you said). This is exactly the sort of information/advice that I was looking for. 

My boyfriend told me to take as much time as I needed to come to a decision, but after a day of researching what it's all about, I'm actually feeling more hopeful than I thought I would be. I think a lot of my distress about the situation came from the stigma surrounding herpes and STDs in general and less about the facts. I think that if he or someone else is the guy for me, then herpes isn't a dealbreaker. It might be a little less than ideal, but don't we all have less-than-ideal bodies that we just learn how to take care of? 

I'm so glad you pointed out that his honesty is a huge green flag because that's how I'm feeling right now too :) We're meeting up tonight to talk things over so I may re-visit this post to give an update ### I learned about the difference only after we had the conversation, so I didn't think to ask. I thought HSV1 only caused cold sores, but a quick Google search tells me I had an oversimplified understanding. I'll ask him when we meet up tonight. ### How'd it go? ### It went really well. Now I just feel closer to him because of his honesty and I feel like we can be more vulnerable emotionally with each other.

te6qqr,"Western Blot Results My most recent IgG scores for HSV 1 and 2 were 4.90 and 1.10 respectively, with a negative supplemental test for HSV 2. My Western Blot came back negative for both HSV 1 and 2. I'm relieved, but more just incredibly angry at every medical professional that discouraged me from getting the Blot and actively hindered my first few attempts to get one. It's been a terrible few months trying to get it done. Confirmatory testing should be offered to everyone, period. People deserve to know their status. 

I won't take up further space here as someone without herpes, but I invite anyone curious to hit up my DMs with any questions regarding my health or how to go about getting the WB.",7,2022-03-14 16:18:35-04:00,"It's very, very, very frustrating. In the UK we have basically no access to the Western Blot. I've spent a lot of money trying different tests and many hours researching what my options are. So, although this has no doubt been extremely stressful for you, please spare a thought for those of us in your position who are basically screwed and can't even get the Western Blot. 

I got so far as sending off for the kit, organising fedex (a nightmare given they don't even give you an idea of pick up times and the package is time/temperature sensitive), travelled 2 hours to the only lab I could find that would draw and spin my blood... only to get there and find out after I had had my blood taken that they wouldn't sign the request form (despite having told me they would!). I spent the next hour in a doctor's office trying to tell him, that no I did not have HIV, I was trying to access the Western Blot for HSV! When he eventually understood what I was doing there, he rang his lab over the phone and was told after much discussion that the IgG is in fact a Western Blot. So, confused by this given that my understanding was that Washington was the only place for the WB, but somewhat relieved, he convinced me to do the test through them, which was another couple hundred at least. The results came back a day later (first sign it can't have been the WB since the WB takes time) and it was the exact same lab company and test I had used previously. Such a massive, massive waste of time and money. I'd estimate I've easily spent over £500 at this point on tests, packing materials, transport, doctors/blood draw and I'm no closer to an answer. If I do successfully get the WB arranged I'll be closer to £1000.

I totally get what you mean about how hard it is reaching out to the medical profession. They often come from such a strident, knowledgeable background that they can't possibly accept the Western Blot even exists, let alone that its useful. It doesn't seem to fit within their paradigm of working so they write it off. It boggles my mind that the gold standard isn't available the world over - even the UW medical centre states in the letters they give you to pass on to the medical practitioners/sample collectors that their test can be ordered from their website for use in labs. Yet no one; not one single organisation or company has done this tp my knowledge.

Thanks for sharing OP - obviously you're probably not going to hang around here anymore, you've no reason to, but all the best to you and congratulations on persevering and getting this sorted! ### Is the western blot test by blood or swab? ### I have GHSV-1 and while I haven't disclosed to an immediate potential sexual partner yet, part of it would include saying that if they wanted to know if they already had HSV-1, they could get tested. But with the unreliability of the blood tests in both directions, part of me wonders the point of even putting them through that. I would want to encourage the Western Blot (IF they wanted to get tested - their choice if they'd rather not know).

How did you go about getting it eventually, and how much did it cost?

I am also worried about quoting all the stats and research that I'm pretty sure used seropositivity as a metric for estimating the rate of both types of herpes. Those metrics could be wildly over- or underestimated, right? Or are western blots used in that kind of research? They should be... ### Blood, separated serum and plasma. ### Blood tests are accurate enough for most people, but the WB of course remains the gold standard. I called the University of Washington Virology Lab, they sent me a kit for the blood sample and some forms my psychiatrist signed since the doctors who tested me were uncooperative and certain I had HSV. Then I got my blood drawn at a women's hospital and they shipped everything back. I paid over the phone once the Lab got my sample. Something like 256$ or 265, numbers are not my strong suit.

The research papers will let you know what tests they used on whom. ### Had the same situation with thinking about asking an ex to get an IgG. Basically she told me that after everything I had been through, and since she had no symptoms, she would rather not get a blood test for hsv. I didn't blame her to be honest. ### ",12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/te6qqr/western_blot_results/

tea07j,"Constant outbreaks for 6+ months - trying to get SADBE in US Had ghsv2 for about 2 years now. Used to get outbreaks every few months and was manageable. I'd say since around October I've had basically a nonstop outbreak. My derm prescribed me 1g daily of valtrex yet it does nothing to stop the frequency of outbreaks. It does help with the severity though. I'll take 2g when I have a bad outbreak. I ran out of refills the other day and at the time had a very very small outbreak that was getting better and THE FIRST DAY without taking valtrex I got a bad outbreak in a new area i've never had symptoms before.

I feel like i've tried everything...except SADBE. Valtrex, supplements, elimination diet, healthier living etc. literally nothing works. Reading about SADBE is really interesting though and gives me a little bit of hope. I am in the US (Denver) and made an appointment with my derm to talk about this and even brought some studies and info I found around here but she wasn't comfortable prescribing it. She told me she would look into it but was pretty clearly not going to prescribe it.

She said because it's off-label there's a chance she could get in trouble. She recommended I go to the local universities derm office because they can prescribe off-label prescriptions without the liabilities she would have? Idk. I just completely wasted $50 though and even came prepared with studies to show her.

It significantly reduced my outbreaks.

For those that don’t know, SADBE is a topical immunotherapy that has completed Phase 2 trials in suppressing HSV for 3-4 months per application. The company running the trials plans to conduct Phase 3 trials so they can commercialize the therapy for HSV, but the therapy is already used in the US for HPV (warts) and alopecia.

do not give up. look up another dermatologist and try again. you’re on the right path. go in knowing your stuff with your print outs and be confident in your ask.

That’s just not something I can get behind.

I’m only supportive of individuals obtaining this therapy via a prescription through their doctor after all other treatment avenues have failed.

Making medication, especially an experimental one, is very dangerous. The chances of making the medication incorrectly or applying it incorrectly is very likely. In my opinion, SADBE therapy needs to be directed by a doctor, preferably a dermatologist who already prescribes it for HPV.

Hope this makes sense. ### Totally makes sense.  Thank you for clarifying.

Have you had your genital symptoms swab tested and confirmed as being herpes? Because transmitting to oneself in the manner you described, after already having an oral infection for years, is exceptionally unlikely. Not impossible but very exceptionally unlikely.

>I take half a g of Valtrex daily but I still have outbreaks several times a year ... I’m wondering WHY this might be happening.

For suppression using Valtrex/valacyclovir, people are typically started at 500mg/day, but if they still experience outbreaks at that dose they are bumped to 1000mg/day.

So I would suggest you do that if your genital symptoms have been confirmed as being herpes. If they haven't then I would wait for the next occurrence and get them swab tested. ### I’ve been confirmed by blood and sight.

No swab for either. No plans to get swabbed because the VA is detrimental to my mental health and they’re my only option.

I’ll bump that dose up though.

Thanks for replying 🙏 ### If you bump up your dose and don't notice any difference, that would suggest that your genital symptoms *might* not actually be herpes.

tej1n1,"OHSV1 + GHSV1 question Hi team! 

Long time lurker, firstly just want to acknowledge how incredible this sub has been, truely a beacon of light in an otherwise shitty situation.

I just wanted to see if anybody has had the same experience as I have. When I had my first breakout in 2018 it was both oral and genital (yay blowjobs). Had a swab on genitals and got the positive HSV1 result. 

 Since my initial outbreak in 2018 I’ve not had a single breakout oral or genitally. Currently I’ve got either a mouth ulcer or a breakout but it’s difficult to tell as my OHSV1 was never on my lips but on the inside of my mouth. 

Does this mean the virus is still active in both locations? Or is it just potentially more active in my mouth because it prefers this location?",1,2022-03-15 02:59:53-04:00,[deleted] ### ,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tej1n1/ohsv1_ghsv1_question/

tehzdg,"loosing someone to something i seriously did not consider School these days never give us any information when it comes to sex education. 
I'm in high school, living life and wanting love. A week ago I had a problem and its with herpes. My boyfriend, well ex, left me after he tested positive for what I'm guessing to be genital herpes ( I still have not that much information about his side since he doesn't want to talk to me at all) and I was probably the one to give it to him. It's been hurting me a lot. Our relationship was going so great and he was happy since I was his ""first love"". My first question to all is that if this ever occurred would you have cut them out of your life entirely even your at your happiest with them? I mean I understand after a week that his anger is understandable since it was unexpected and he is a virgin. His biggest concerns was how he was gonna tell future partners. But at the same time I seriously did not know about this and I did not mean to pass it on if I do have it. Never wanted to hurt him or even loose him in this way, just hurts. Either way are we suppose to know how to be safe even when not tought? Condoms, how are they used I have no clue. 
Anyways, it hurts to think i could have been the reason i gave someone herpes. And mostly if it's their genitals. I hear it can be painful for the first few weeks. School doesn't teach me and neither does my family since I live in a strict household  in which the only thing that is told to us ladies is to not have sex till marriage. 

Anyone have something like this? I have never had symptoms and telling my mom is not something I want to do.

Condoms do protect against it, but only do so much depending on whether or not they're having an outbreak. They also make protection for oral sex as well. Essentially if they're having an outbreak it's kind of a no contact deal. Like let's say if it were orally and someone had a cold sore, it'd simply mean no kissing until its healed up. A lot of people don't even realize they have it because it stays dormant for a lot of people and they're typically asymptomatic. Some people have outbreaks and brush it off not thinking anything of it. There's also the instances of children being kissed by an adult as a child and accidentally passing it onto the child. So in the event it did come from you and you guys have never done anything with each other or anyone else that could be possible. Thats about the best summary i can give you there's plenty of other and better explained information out there as well.. Schools really don't teach enough on any of this, our Sex ed was just an hour, an embarrassed and awkward teacher, and then a super short quiz. It wasn't even Sex ed it was just a health class.

Aldo, shedding to a level that infects others is a factor.  As an example, HSV-2 purportedly sheds far more than HSV-1, yet it’s prevalence is something like 6x less in society.

I've had it almost 20 years, and it's not dormant. I take Valtrex, too. You need to educate yourself. Herpes never goes ""dormant"" and the possibility of transmission is always there. You've had it a ""couple of years"" - you are shedding 13.1% of days without counting outbreaks. If you include outbreaks if you have them, it's 20.6% of days. 

Yes, Valtrex reduces transmission, but you are not ""dormant"".

Total HSV shedding occurred on 33.6% of days in participants <1 year, 20.6% in those 1–9 years, and 16.7% in those ≥10 years from first episode. Subclinical HSV shedding occurred on 26.2% of days among participants <1 year, 13.1% in those 1–9 years, and 9.3% in those ≥10 years from first episode.

Conclusions. Rates of total and subclinical HSV-2 shedding decrease after the first year following the initial clinical episode. However, viral shedding persists at high rates and copy numbers years after infection, and therefore may pose continued risk of HSV-2 transmission to sexual partners.""

That doesn't mean you aren't still shedding. Remember that the vast majority of exposures to asymptomatic shedding don't actually result in transmission. For asymptomatic transmission to occur, several things need to happen just right. Asymptomatic shedding makes transmission possible but certainly doesn't guarantee it.

So, u/GenoFlower's comment is most likely correct. If you have genital hsv2 then, no matter whether you still get outbreaks or not, it is highly likely that you still periodically shed virus. ### Hsv1 spreads more because of oral hsv1, which sheds a lot more than ghsv1.

When you hear the numbers for hsv1 - currently at 67% for people under 50 globally - it includes oral hsv1.

All we have are studies. We can't all assume that we are shedding less than what the studies say. And we all shed. I don't understand what is so hard to grasp here.

We definitely don't always shed to a level that infects someone else. We don't even know what that level is. We do know transmission stats for ghsv2, though, and if we always shed at high rates, we'd be infecting at higher rates.

I don't mean to make anyone feel like a walking biohazard. I certainly don't feel that way. We do have to accept the risk, though.

Edited to add - I wouldn't worry about a risk for oral hsv2 at all, by the way, which is where this whole thing started, unless someone was having an outbreak. ### Yeah what lol ### >If she has herpes anally and I want to go down on her (🐱) would I get it orally or would I have to actively touch a sore?

If your partner has a genital herpes infection and you were to catch it when you perform oral sex on her, then that would result in you having an oral herpes infection, yes. But unless she has an active outbreak at the time you perform oral sex, the likelihood of you catching it via oral sex would be *very* low. 

Both kinds of genital herpes, genital hsv1 and genital hsv2, post a very low risk of genital-to-oral transmission if no outbreak is present.

Genital hsv1 poses a very low risk of genital-to-oral transmission outside of an active outbreak because genital hsv1 is one of the least active kinds of herpes there is. It very rarely sheds asymptomatically (ie very rarely becomes active on the skin surface without causing actual visible symptoms). Then add to that the fact that the vast majority of exposures to asymptomatic shedding don't result in transmission *anyway*, and you can see the risk is very low. Genital hsv1 poses a very low risk of genital-to-*genital* transmission outside of active outbreaks for the same reason.

Genital hsv2, meanwhile, asymptomatically sheds considerably more frequently than genital hsv1. But hsv2 has a very strong preference for the genital region. Even when it is given the opportunity to infect orally it usually doesn't bother. Oral hsv2 is fairly uncommon.

I would also point out that if your partner gets outbreaks on her anus, that still means that she has genital herpes. When a person has genital herpes then, *regardless* of where they experience their outbreaks, they will still periodically shed virus from their genital tract -- which for women means the labia, vagina, cervix and anus.

That being said, genital hsv1 is one of the last active kinds of herpes there is. It rarely sheds in the absence of symptoms, and the vast majority of exposures to asymptomatic shedding don't result in transmission anyway. So you'd be looking at a *very* small degree of risk here. 

And be aware that if you already happen to have oral hsv1 yourself then you'd be at no practical risk from a partner's genital hsv1 infection at all. You would already have hsv1 antibodies.

You also asked:

>If i did get it but have no symptoms should I take medicine or just let it run it’s coarse?

That would depend on your reason for taking the medication. Medication can be used to treat an active outbreak, to minimize outbreak extent and speed healing. But if you're not having an outbreak then that wouldn't be applicable.

Medication can also be taking on a ongoing daily basis to:

* reduce outbreak frequency, and/or

* to reduce the risk of asymptomatically transmitting to a partner ### Fine ### Yes I read it.  Maybe you should include some additional information rather than just asking me if I read it. 

Now I have to assume what your misunderstanding is, so here goes: 

You think because he’s refusing to get tested, he should be willing to go down on someone with confirmed genital herpes, unprotected?

Well that seems incorrect.   What was it doing in your partner when you had unprotected sex for 5.9 straight years and didn’t get it yet? ### In reply to u/GenoFlower, you wrote:

>You’re accounting for the fact that our bodies work the same. They don’t. Stop telling me to educate myself lmfao I know fully what I’m dealing with.

You clearly don't. And you are hereby suspended from the sub for 1 week. ### UPDATE: After reviewing this post in more detail, I'm reducing your suspension to 2 days from a week and leaving the post itself up, because there's some good discussion here. But again, it is not appropriate to be rude, condescending and dismissive towards other users here who say accurate things -- especially when you the things you're saying yourself are incorrect or highly dubious and based on faulty reasoning.

You weren't clear about how long you've had herpes for and asymptomatic shedding frequency does decrease over time. But it's still very likely that you asymptomatically shed to some degree, even if you no longer get outbreaks. Also, the fact that your other recent partner never caught it is *not* evidence that you don't asymptomatically shed. ### >it’s pretty dormant at this point

I need to clarify how I interpreted this statement, apparently. 

Dormant means inactive, or inactivity, right? Medically, it means inactive, but not cured. 

If you are shedding, it isn't inactive. It's not dormant. 

You can shed, and not infect your partner. As in the study I posted above, shedding isn't 24/7, and as we know from transmission studies, transmission isn't guaranteed. You have to have enough virus to transmit, and we don't know how much that takes, or if it's different for each person. 

My former partner was shedding. He had outbreaks, so his herpes was not dormant. 

I just don't want anyone thinking that if they don't get outbreaks for a period of time, they can't transmit. 

A good example of a dormant virus is the chicken pox virus. If you get that, it is dormant in your body, and then later, can reactivate into the shingles. It's actually dormant, though - when you don't have symptoms, you can't transmit it. It's not doing any harm to your body, it's not progressing, it's just there. ### ",13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/te0dy8/want_my_man_to_go_down_on_me_but_hes_concerned/

Herpes would definitely not cause that. That symptom is most often caused by a bladder infection.

> I’ve also noticed bumps on my shaft about 6 weeks ago and they haven’t healed as of today.

Herpes also wouldn't cause bumps that persist for 6 weeks. Herpes lesions last 2-10 days and they go through their entire series of phases within that time (blister formation, blister, blister surface erosion leaving an ulcer, crusting/scabbing, and scab healing), so they don't remain looking unchanged for more than a day or two either. ### How about the mild tingling/burning? ### I couldn't tell from your description whether you're talking about tingling/burning sensations *inside* your body, or on the outside on the skin. If on the outside, lots of different things can cause mild tingling/burning in the genital region. Common causes of such sensations are fungal infections or yeast infections, but there are other possibilities as well. If you're talking about inside your urethra, the most common cause is probably some sort of bacterial infection (which would be consistent with your possible/likely bladder infection -- since bladder infections often start as a UTI, Urinary Tract Infection, that then makes it's way back through the urethra to the bladder and causes an infection there as well), though there may be other possibilities. ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tehsc4/could_this_be_herpes/

te42o0,"just found out I have herpes and the guy lied to me I'm so beside myself. He said he was clean. Now I have it. My life is ruined. I should have stayed single but I wanted to be loved. How was I so stupid. 
How do I continue on like this. It's so painful and embarrassing. No one wanted me before and know this. I'm going to be single forever. I want to kill myself. Please help me. What do I do? 
The scum won't answer my calls or anything now. I'm  a mess.....I hate myself. Please. Help me",24,2022-03-14 14:21:48-04:00,"Please don’t put yourself down like this. The worst part about herpes is the stigma. It’s more common than you know! I just got it myself from the person I was with who also lied. I found out shortly after Valentine’s Day and was a complete mess too. Now I’m not going to say I’m fully over it, because I’m not. It’s a lot to accept and adjust to. BUT your life isn’t ruined. You are still YOU. Regardless of your hsv status. More than half the world has it and many do and don’t even realize. Sadly, hsv tests aren’t part of standard std panels and most doctors advise you not to test unless you have an outbreak. Making it very hard to know if you even have it or not in the first place. There’s talk of cures out there and so many support groups and antibiotics to help. Please know you’re not alone and everything will be okay. Life goes on ❤️ please feel free to message me if you need anything. We are all in this together ### Your life isn’t over. I promise you that. There’s plenty of people here who live normal lives and are in love. Just do your research on it and you’ll see it’s just the stigma telling you that. Get some antivirals & learn your triggers. I’m sorry it sucks but it really isn’t the end of the world ### The guy who gave it to me was also clean. STD panels don’t include herpes so for all we knew, he was negative for everything! In your case, he may not have known he had herpes. Either way, herpes is something many many people live with and should be normalized. Moving forward and moving on sounds like it might be the best option for you. There are plenty of people who are positive and plenty of people go are willing to be educated. Take some time to read statistics about transmission and how tons of people have herpes and never spread it to their partner, even while having unprotected sex. Best of luck and take it easy on yourself:) xoxo ### [deleted] ### i gets better. all i can say is try to do something for YOU. take a walk, smoke a bowl, play a game, do your nails, whatever you need. the news is shocking, but it gets better. your life isnt over. did you know that this news is so psychologically traumatizing that doctors dont test for it? 80% of people who have this never show symptoms and never know because they wont test for it. you are not alone and you will likely have safer sex than a majority of the population if you take precautions. you are loved now and you will be loved by many others in the future.   


and remember: HOT PEOPLE HAVE HERPES. ### Your life is not over. A majority of the population has some form of herpes. There are support and singles groups for herpes here and on FB. There are also dating apps just for this. ### Don't put yourself down like this, that's far from helpful and just makes the feelings worse. Did he know he has it? In my experience herpes isn't something people usually aware of, I had no idea of it and always figured asking for full STD check also included herpes, but appearantly one usually gotta ask for it so we all just walking around all unknowingly. 
I remember I felt awful when I first got it diagnosed, it felt like a death sentence. But I chose to kinda just own that shit, I read up on it alot, found support in communities like this, and was surprised how normal it is. I thought my sexlife was over and out, but chose to keep open about it as soon as I saw a date leading to sex, and have only experienced one rejection - and even he was very respectful about it. So it gave me hope, and now it's just this thing I have. Stress trigger it, so it helps me noticing when I need to chill the fuck out so I guess that's a bright side of it😂 
I know it seems awful now, but I promise you your life is not over. ### I’m in the same boat. I wanted to feel wanted and accepted in the gay community. I got GHSV1. I feel unattractive and hopeless of finding someone awesome. We need to reinforce in ourselves a mindset that we are fine and will get through this and will find that special someone. I know it is tough, but we got to do it. ### I would really recommend therapy. I’ve been cheated on and contracted this and have terrible self esteem issues too. 1.5 years after I got the diagnosis I met someone who has been nothing short of perfect and patient even knowing what I have. But I had to work on myself a lot and still have a lot of work to do. You deserve love even if it’s you loving yourself. ### [deleted] ### I'm so scared. I've never had anything like this before. And to be lied to like this. I'm so hurt. I'm don't know what to do....I can never be with someone again because I'm so scared they are going to lie about something too. Everyone lies to me and hurts me. The cheating wasn't so bad looking back now compared to this. ### I think I'm just done with people. It's the lies and cheating and putting me down I can't handle anymore and this wad the last straw. Now I have to live with this forever and I can never forget what this man did to me. The emotional pain is so much worse than the physical ### It's the being lied to again that hurts the most. I'm never going to trust anyone. ### I'm also ugly as fuck and that's why I went with the first guy who would talk to me. My low self esteem did this. ### I'm not loved now. I was lied to and now I'm all alone. I asked him about the bumps and he said they were my fault because I'm too dry. Now I'm broken and incontinent. I have to wear diapers now. I'm so embarrassed ### I get rejected enough because of the way my vagina looks already, now that I have this I doubt I'll find anyone. Plus I can't trust anyone after being lied to again. I'm fine being alone. I'll get use to it again ### It just took me 20 years of therapy go be OK with myself and then instantly this happens. I'm done with life. I worked so hard for it to all be taken away in an instant ### I am ruined. I'm a disgusting bar slut now. I've been self harming and I'm planning to go get some drugs ### I'm hot and my low self esteem did this lol. I repeatedly slept with someone who has unprotected sex with sex workers. I knew I should ask for protection but I didn't. because of that, I got it and my entire friend group had to get tested....talk about embarrassing. I actually feel very conflicted being attractive and having herpes. it's it's own complex. I'm willing to bet you're more attractive than you think, but attractiveness aside, this is shitty news for anyone and we will get through it. it's just a skin condition that's been blown out of proportion. ### I felt that way as well. I've been single and actively dating for 3 years, and my self esteem was great!  not gonna lie, I do get thoughts of ""I couldn't find anyone then. how will I now?"" but reading some of the positive stories on here has helped immensely. those are fear based thoughts and I refuse to live in fear. plus, disclosing may actually weed out the worst of the worst, if you're used to settling. life will go on. herpes made you incontinent? is that permanent? never heard of that. please don't think you will be loved any less for that. everyone has their health issues. something like that wouldn't bother me a bit. 

there are also HSV dating apps. I haven't looked at those yet but it's an option. ### With me in now incontinent.....I wish I had a skin rash ### I feel like a dumb baby now, wearing a diaper.... they said because it attacks the nerves it can cause that and I already have lime disease so I'm fucked. 
I can't trust anyone. Plus would you date a girl in a diaper? It's so gross. I'm so ashamed of my body now ### I've dated disabled people and people who are HSV positive, even when I was like 21, STD-free, and a total catch. more people will be open to you than you think and that number will increase the older you get. I get it though. fuck, do I get it. thank you for letting me vent some as well. ### ahhh, well there is hope I think? the virus seems to be alot stronger in the first year. ...not that the waiting game is that much fun. 

honestly,  I would. I've been single and rejected so many people. if I found someone I think I could spend my life with, that would be a total non-issue. your fears are understandable, but do keep in mind: all bodies are gross!! ### I'm 35 and I'm done trying. I just got over sexual trauma and that took years and then this happens. I'm so messed up from this. I'm scared. I have no one in my life. If I even told my mom she would legit physical beat me...I feel so alone ### ",5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/te42o0/just_found_out_i_have_herpes_and_the_guy_lied_to/
tefslq,"Oral HSV-1 transmission chances (non-active aka no cold sores) Hello everyone, I (24M) have recently gotten oral HSV-1 and have been pretty anxious about the idea of giving it to others which has caused me to fall into an endless loop of paranoia of what I can do and can’t (when I don’t have active cold sores of course). I’ve seen many articles online stating that herpes (even when asymptomatic and no outbreaks) can be transmissible to others. I’ve also seen that sharing things such as utensils or drinks, and even kissing won’t transfer the virus to others (obviously when you have healed and don’t have any sores present). I guess my question is: if I hadn’t had a cold sore in an extended amount of time and I share a drink, vape pen, joint, etc with others, how likely is the virus going to be transmissible (based on your experiences and any resource you know or can find that can answer my question). I’m asking this because while I want others to know about my condition, I also want them to be assured in case of any misunderstandings (on both my end and theirs). ALSO, I am a huge rave/concert person. I know herpes is not airborne, but should I be concerned about potentially spreading the virus if I’m in a close proximity event where I’m with people shoulder to shoulder and face to face? (Again of course with no symptoms or sores present)",2,2022-03-14 23:37:48-04:00,">I guess my question is: if I hadn’t had a cold sore in an extended amount of time and I share a drink, vape pen, joint, etc with others, how likely is the virus going to be transmissible


Herpes expert Terri Warren, who has a 35+ year career researching and treating herpes specifically, has repeatedly stressed that herpes *cannot* be transmitted via drinking straws, cups, utensils, cigarettes/joints/bongs/vapes, shared food items, or inanimate objects in general. Herpes is a very fragile virus that cannot live long outside the body and requires both moisture and warmth to survive. Also, a certain *volume* of virus is required in order to cause an infection. A small trace amount is insufficient. Terri has stated that the only inanimate objects that pose any practical risk of *oral* transmission are lipsticks / chapsticks / lip gloss because the particular properties of these items can sometimes sustain the virus for short periods and they can sometimes be used by another person immediately after someone who might be contagious. Similarly, she has stated that the only inanimate objects that pose any risk for *genital* transmission are shared sex toys that, again, might be used by another person immediately after a person who is infected. She also advises people with genital infections to not share bath towels *when they are having an outbreak*, but expects the risk of transmission in this manner to still be extremely unlikely.

Here is one such quote from Terri on her clinic forum where she addresses the issue and responds to someone asking about potential transmission from sharing a phone:

>the only inanimate objects I am at all concerned about are sex toys and lipsticks. We do advise individuals not to share warm moist towels, but even transmission in this way is extremely unlikely. The phone is not the kind of contact that transmits herpes. There has to be more contact than that. To acquire herpes, there is a certain amount of virus that need to be present and it is not a tiny amount. I guess if a person had a big cold sore and was rubbing their cold sore actively into the phone and then the next person came up immediately afterwards and started putting the phone in their mouth, there might be a 1% chance of transmission. It just doesn’t happen this way.

([Source](https://www.westoverheights.com/forum/question/mouth-outbreaks-and-transmission-through-phone-sharing/))
  
And here's another example where a client wrote:

>Scenario: My friend has large and frequent cold sores. I was visiting her for coffee and when she was making the coffees she licked and sucked the spoon she was using and then used the spoon to scoop the milk froth on top of my coffee (did not stir). She had a healing cold sore (scab had fallen off). I was worried but too polite to say anything, so waited 5 minutes before drinking my coffee trying to avoid the froth.

>The next day I woke up with a sore throat, slight sniffles and light headedness (but I also had a cold/allergies last week). My top lip felt funny but it could have been in my imagination due to being paranoid or just dry. I got Zovirax and put it on just in case.

And Terri replied:

>Someone else on here asked a similar question today but with soup instead of coffee. My answer is the same – a million to one chance that you would contract herpes in this way.

>I don’t know why medical websites say that honestly. There is just no evidence in the scientific literature to say that this is true and I’m totally a science based clinician. Perhaps it is because people go into their providers and say “I ate hot soup that my friend made who gets cold sores and now I have one”. Of course, we can’t extrapolate that because someone who has cold sores did something and now you have one, you got it from them. The only inanimate object that I worry about for transmission of oral herpes is sharing lipsticks. Lipsticks and lip gloss stay moist and if someone with active oral virus uses lipstick immediately before someone else, that is a possibility for transmission. That’s why cosmetic counters no longer allow testing with the actual lipstick and now use surrogates, like q tips.

teept5,"What are my chances of contracting. So I had unprotected oral sex from a girl who said she gets cold sores. 

And had protected sex. 

I have the smallest red little irritation. And have had some burning and itching at random spots not associated with this spot of red irritation. 

The doctor looked at it and said it’s likely herpes. 

The spot of irritation would have been covered by the condom. What are the chances this is ghsv1 instead of ghsv2?",5,2022-03-14 22:41:09-04:00,"It's hard to say - your chances of hsv1 are higher because you used a condom for sex. 

Did the doctor test you? They can do a PCR swab on the spots and test you for herpes. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/wiki/herpes\_testing ### Whether it’s ghsv1 or ghsv2, it would still be genital herpes regardless of the type 1 or type 2 status. However, hsv1 is definitely more common orally… so chances would be higher that she had oral hsv1 and therefore giving you ghsv1. However, the types don’t matter that much and it’s still considered genital herpes. ### Yes I got my third round of blood testing. It will be 9 weeks since the time I had unprotected sex with this girl. And 5 weeks since the protected sex. I didn’t notice any symptoms really until after this recent time though. 

The spot doesn’t really have any kind of thing to swab. It’s the smallest red patch. 

Also if the girl was on her period. Would that up the chances of catching it even with a condom. ### They do matter. Since ghsv1 is transmitted far less. ### They can do the PCR swab, which is different than the regular culture, on just a red spot. 

No, her period wouldn't up her chances. Herpes isn't found in blood. 

Don't do any more testing until 12 weeks since the unprotected oral. There are false positives, especially on the hsv2, and the more you test, the better the chances you'll get one. Unraveling that can take weeks and hundreds of dollars. Save yourself the anxiety and the money. ### ",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/teept5/what_are_my_chances_of_contracting/
tea1rp,"Is this okay, or am I too late? Just diagnosed GHSV1 beginning of February, got it from my bf’s OHSV1.

te9nla,"constant outbreaks for 6+months - trying to get SADBE in US Had ghsv2 for about 2 years now. Used to get outbreaks every few months and was manageable. I'd say since around October I've had basically a nonstop outbreak. My derm prescribed me 1g daily of valtrex yet it does nothing to stop the frequency of outbreaks. It does help with the severity though. I'll take 2g when I have a bad outbreak. I ran out of refills the other day and at the time had a very very small outbreak that was getting better and THE FIRST DAY without taking valtrex I got a bad outbreak in a new area i've never had symptoms before.   


I feel like i've tried everything...except SADBE. Valtrex, supplements, elimination diet, healthier living etc. literally nothing works. Reading about SADBE is really interesting though and gives me a little bit of hope. I am in the US (Denver) and made an appointment with my derm to talk about this and even brought some studies and info I found around here but she wasn't comfortable prescribing it. She told me she would look into it but was pretty clearly not going to prescribe it.   


She said because it's off-label there's a chance she could get in trouble. She recommended I go to the local universities derm office because they can prescribe off-label prescriptions without the liabilities she would have? Idk. I just completely wasted $50 though and even came prepared with studies to show her.

Why put yourself at risk at a young age when who knows if we’ll even work out. ### Same. Kind of just accepted I’ll be single until there is a cure or something that makes me not have to disclose ### Yes medical people are more understanding of these :D i read somewhere hahaha ### Yes, it really is a “luck of the draw” kind of thing in many ways. I got it from my second long-term partner. I had never “slept around.” I confided in one of my friends about it, he said he had slept with close to 40 people and hadn’t contracted it. You just never know. Definitely a hard situation to navigate, but you will figure out what works for you. I hope all goes well. ### This is where your knowledge should kick in. Enlightened them. ### Having sex with someone who has herpes does not mean they will 100% contract it. There’s ways to be safe and reduce transmission (condoms, antivirals, just monitoring your body… and even time! With time comes less viral shedding and therefore reduces chances of transmission). Since my diagnosis, I have not transmitted hsv to any of my new partners. 

Additionally, 1 out of 6 people have ghsv but the vast majority are asymptomatic. It’s actually more commonly spread by asymptomatic partners since they don’t know they have it and therefore don’t take any precautions! Sometimes sex with someone with herpes who knows their status can be a lot safer than someone who is asymptomatic who doesn’t. For example, I know I’m positive for ghsv2. I take a daily antiviral, vitamins to boost immunity, monitor my body, and use protection when I have sex. I try to make sex as safe for my partner as possible… and open communication is a big part of it too. 

Also if she’s a medical student, she’ll most likely be very understanding. Might as well try. Doesn’t have to be a “forever” relationship. Just because you have herpes doesn’t mean that you can’t still date. ### Hey. You're right. But I'd still think you should let her know how you feel. At least ### I know but I’m the only person she’d had sex with and if on the slim chance she does get it idk if could live with myself ### That’s her choice to make. I’m in health care, and there’s a little thing called making an informed decision. Basically give them all the facts & info and they decide what they’d like their course of action to be given all the information. I know it’s really hard emotionally, but physically its not a big deal. May be a bit uncomfortable for a couple days a few times a year, but it really isn’t a big health issue. Ultimately it’s her choice, but by disclosing you’re giving her information for her to make an informed decision regarding her sexual health. You don’t have a crystal ball. You don’t know she’ll reject you & you don’t know that you’ll for sure transmit to her. But doesn’t hurt to at least have the conversation. ### For sure, I’ll be with her next week so I’ll update how it goes if I decide to have the conversation ### ",17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tdtgb4/feeling_down/
te4dxn,"Partner did no disclose the fact they get cold sores  

Whats going on. 30s/m/usa here. I've been with my girlfriend since 2019. After so many failed relationships and issues (cultural stuff and I wasn't exactly the smoothest guy when I was younger) Recently moved in. I'm sure people will say ""everyone has it"" or etc but as of 2019 I had no HSV-1 or 2 antibodies and **I told my partner this at the beginning of the relationship,** and she claimed she was also a-ok even after I mentioned herpes (as I know most panels dont include it). Generally a condom user, visually will check out stuff during the heat of the moment if its a one night stand (yes not full proof, but if no sores/lesions + condom, chances are at least lowered extremely) and I don't receive oral willy nilly.

Maybe I lucked all during my 20s out or it was my diligence. Fast forward to about 72 hours ago and my gf is having oral outbreak, red /inflamed/blisters. I'm sure she noticed my face / posture and mentioned ""its just Herpes"" and threw in some leprosy jokes.

In short. I was vocal about my health status, and she withheld the fact that she has oral herpes outbreaks. After about 3 years of non condoms and oral sex...I possibly have hsv-1/2 orally or genitally now. Maybe I've semi lucked out and I'm part of the asymptomatic team but I fairly upset she just decided not to mention this at all. **The worst part is she works in healthcare (obgyn) so she knows he has been putting me at risk for oral/genital lesions from passing it**. Not on meds, never said a word....effectively lied to me. A few times she has had ""eczema"" around the mouth, but now I'm thinking...maybe she was breaking out, knew it, and tried to cover.

I'm sitting here thinking how she purposely lied to me  
I'm sitting here thinking at any point in the near future possible sores can appear on my mouth or penis area.  
I'm sitting here thinking about having to tell new women this, get ghosted, and be the responsible person to disclose, if antibodies come back positive.  
I'm sitting here thinking that a person I loved/trusted wouldn't have the decency to just tell me this  
I'm sitting here thinking if we break up I'll be the bad guy possibly to her friends/family

I'm curious to hear peoples ethical view point. To me consent really matters. **I wasnt even given the choice to decide if I wanted play this rodeo**. If she would have disclosed I would have been like ""do you mind getting on meds ?"" Gonna get a western blot test and not even play the IGM/IGG game.

If it was ""just herpes"", why didn't she just tell you?

You asked, she lied. This wasn't a case of she didn't know, or was confused, or you never asked. You asked, she lied. That's a real issue. 

A note - if she has oral hsv1, and you get it genitally, it's genital hsv1, not hsv2. The number indicates the strain, not the location of the infection. 

There's also a fairly decent chance you have hsv1 and tested negative - the hsv1 IgG misses 30% of infections. It could explain why you haven't gotten it from her.

And I don't want to have to educate adult men about the statistics or sound like I'm begging or justifying in any way, but I did tell him how long I've had it and that I'm on Valtrex and currently asymptomatic. It definitely sucked the air out of the room and he told me about his herpes scare but reiterated that he doesn't have it and said something along the lines of can't risk it. So I hugged him and started gathering my things to leave, but then he pulled me back in to make out for a while longer. And it was very passionate and he was struggling to restrain himself so it didn't seem out of pity. Then he texted me to let him know when I was safely home and said he had a great time that will make for nice dreams. 

So what now? Despite being a fully-grown adult woman in her 30s with 8+ years of knowing I have herpes, I haven't disclosed much since I used to only date on PositiveSingles. I assume he's mulling it over or maybe even talking to his therapist, but he hasn't texted today and I don't want to reach out first since the ball is in his court. How many days do I give him before I delete his number and move on? ",15,2022-03-14 11:47:22-04:00,"Give it a few days and then reach out again.  If he still seems distant then, toss him to the curb.  Also remember, if he does ghost you or say he doesn't want to see you again, it may not have to do with your disclosure.  It's so easy to assume that that's the reason why, but without him saying so directly, you can't make that assumption. ### I don’t think it would hurt to ask him what’s on his mind. You don’t have to play games and wait for his response. Don’t be pushy, but you can say “I’d like to know where your head is at and see if I can ease any reservations you might have” .. and explain how it usually comes out more graceful and that you’ve come to terms with your diagnosis so if he doesn’t think it’s something he wants to navigate with you, then you’ll have your answer sooner. ### Omg we’re the same the guy i dated twice ghosted me for a whole week. He messaged after and i said “I honestly thought you wouldnt message again”. His response was hilarious “Why wont i? You did nothing criminal against me”

Like wtf so someone is implying something. Hes maintaining communication but i dont think I’ll be comfortable seeing him again. We had a great first two dates but what happened after my sms text disclosure showed me his true colors.

Maybe i just saw him through rose colored lenses at the beginning… now i dont know how to get rid of him lol ### I guess I'm hesitant to try that because he might have thought he made it more clear that it was a deal-breaker, and then it'll be awkward to have to reject me again. It makes me feel kind of desperate to follow up when I feel like it was probably a deal-breaker for him, despite the ambiguity. ### He texted around 2:30 asking how my day was going and how tired he was this morning... So now I have even less of a clue what's going on. I cannot recall exactly what he said last night but after he told a convoluted story about a women he slept with last fall testing positive for herpes and he tested negative, he said something along the lines of ""couldn't take the risk"" or ""didn't want to risk it."" I interpreted that to mean that sleeping with someone with herpes wasn't something he wanted to risk, but maybe he was implying that SHE wasn't worth the risk? I texted him back thinking maybe he was trying to engage me in small talk before letting me know he slept on it and doesn't want to move forward, but nope, just regular daytime checking in chat. WHAT. We've even talked about how important we find open, honest and direct conversation, so I just don't even know what to think. I'll give him another day of whatever he's doing and then ask him directly what he's feeling and how he wants to move forward in light of my disclosure. ### Yeah, we deserve enthusiastic ""yesses."" Anything less should be a delete and move on. ### If it goes wrongly you swallow it and move on. Asking for answers because you’re ok with yourself makes you look bold and and strong, rather than waiting around for him to decide ### I think you’re playing with yourself. Just ask him sister!! Why are you prolonging this? His feelings about it aren’t gonna change in a day!! ### I'll give him until tonight after his son's bed time and then request we close the loop if he's passing on me. It just fucking SUCKS because it is so hard to find someone I even WANT to date or sleep with. ### Good to go! He wants to keep seeing me and is just considering how this will affect our sex life. I also gave him some facts and statistics to help alleviate his concerns. Though I have a suspicion his concern is less about catching herpes and more about having to use condoms forever... I'm going to have to physically restrain myself from word vomiting that my outbreaks are only on my butthole so condoms don't make a difference 😆😆 ### Just make sure you make it clear that you just want to see if he sees potential to navigate this with you. Do not phrase it as him “passing” on you. Cause remember, it’s not you, it’s simply him not being educated enough on the subject and afraid of stigma ### I don't know though if I'm interested if he's only lukewarm. I understand needing more time to research and consider, but if he's not enthusiastically interested in continuing to see me, I see foreshadowing to future problems. ### [deleted] ### If you look in my post history, I made that exact same point a few weeks ago about the unbalanced dynamic between an HSV2+ person and an HSV2- person and how the latter may feel they are doing the former a ""favor"" since they're ""damaged."" That is DEFINITELY not a dynamic I want to be involved in! ### [deleted] ### Oh yes, I am working heavily on my own biases, between weekly therapy, HSV2 group meetings and having super honest conversations with my friends and listening to their feedback. I've made a lot of progress in the past month. I had a REALLY good disclosure a couple weeks ago where I came out via text before our first date, and he immediately said it's not a concern because he knows about how benign it is and the stigma is worse than the rash. I did find myself more drawn to him and appreciative of his open-mindedness, so I like to think I'm moving past being turned off by people who don't care about it. Ultimately we had no chemistry, but I really liked feeling so accepted and didn't think his lack of concern reflected poorly on him. ### ",5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/te0hk7/how_long_after_disclosing_is_it_safe_to_say_i_was/

I’ve now known I’ve had HSV-2 for about a year now and it was a long journey to get to this point where if I think about the fact that I have HSV-2, I don’t analyze it as if it were a huge problem in my life. And here’s why…

If you know you have G-HSV, you should get on Valtrex right away even if you don’t have symptoms. This is because if you take Valtrex AND use a condom, the transmission rate becomes 1.9%.

The facts are that 1 out of every 6 Americans have HSV-2, roughly 17% of the country or 56 million people (think about that for a second). Of those 56 million people we know that 90% of them will never know they have G-HSV either from negligence or they are asymptomatic and would have no reason to believe they have G-HSV.

With this in mind, that means there’s a much higher chance of contracting G-HSV from someone who says “yes, I’ve been tested and I’m clean” (they don’t know they’re “clean” because doctors don’t screen for G-HSV) than there is from someone who knows they have G-HSV but they take Valtrex and wear condoms.

Hope this sets someone free.",5,2022-03-14 07:45:35-04:00,"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa035144

Big study in 2004. We’ve been given a raw deal from our health system and society. They don’t screen for herpes but when you do have herpes they say “well herpes is the one we don’t want because that’s forever.” And then we wonder why there’s a stigma and so many people struggling with this new reality. 

Many times I’ll ask myself would I rather have bad credit or herpes with great credit… I would pick herpes with great credit. ### Just curious where you got the statistic 1.9%. I thought M to F was 2.5% with condoms and antivirals. Obviously not a massive difference but just curious ### This is so true. The crux is that society and the healthcare system are holding two contradictory positions. Some people say “It’s a big deal. Disclose this to everyone despite that it will negatively impact your romantic life.” And simultaneously they are saying “It’s not a big deal. We don’t need to prioritize testing, cures, or treatments.” This incongruence puts people who test positive in a bind. ### Absolutely correct ### ",7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tdvm63/set_someone_free/

What's your experience stopping daily meds  ...  it's a minor outbreak doesn't cause me any pain but obviously the most contagious time so not good for potential sexual partner so to reduce your risk of transmission I'll stay on Valtrex , jus wish my body would go back to its old self. I don't think the vaccine gave me gential herpes but since the vaccine I've started having re occurring outbreaks so just wondering when my body will go back to its old self , March is 1 year I got my first Pfizer dose.

Of course he’s (we) had herpes for about ten years now so maybe his body has a stronger immune response to it now.

I take valtrex daily because I have a boyfriend who doesn’t have hsv2.  

For me and husband, we both tend to end up with outbreaks when we are stressed or have been out in the sun alot or we are sick with something else (like a cold or strep) ### Only had the one outbreak. Nothing since. No meds. I have hsv 1 and have been positive for the last 4 years. ### I was on suppressive valtrex and missed about 2 weeks due to waiting for a refill.

Have you read up on pre drome?  Symptoms you have before a physical outbreak occurs?  I always experience exhaustion before I have a physical outbreak.  So if I’m ever feeling unusually tired, I refrain from sex.  

I’m non monogamous and have quite a few partners since the diagnosis 10 years ago.  To my knowledge my husband is the only person I’ve passed it to and that happened before I knew I had it myself.

te3xz2,"DAE struggle to say no to sex with people who don't have it? I've had full on sex with ONE person that didn't have it since I caught it 12 years ago. 

I've fooled around with many, only one that I didn't disclose to (which I regret, as telling him right afterwards was upsetting, but we are still friends.)

I've had many men say they didn't mind, but I still said no. And that one that I did I was with for 3 years, thinking we'd be together for ever. 

I've got this guy friend and we've hit if off bizarrely well. I got drunk and fooled around with him, but we played rather safely. (He knew I had it btw) The next day he was really anxious about it. Since then he's calmed down and had talked about maybe having oral or full sex. 

I'm so torn. I don't want to spread this. I don't want to change his entire life because I'm horny and can't find someone with it (small dating pool of positive people where I live.)

We're not in a relationship, have no plans to be, so it's just... ugh. 

On top of that, I have my roommate, female, and her and I want to get physical but I'm extra scared with her. 

I'm trying to do research but here's my point:

I swore I would never be with someone who doesn't have it unless I was ready to get married. I feel like it's the moral and right thing to do, regardless of the uninfected partners desires.

> I began feeling cold symptoms. I blamed it on conjunctivitis and a UTI. Swab test at urgent care proved it was herpes

A first-time herpes outbreak can cause flu-like sypmtoms (eg headache, fever, body-aches, light sensitivity, and swollen lymph nodes near the region of infection) but would not cause symptoms of a cold (eg stuffy/runny nose, cough, sore throat, congestion).

>From what I understand, Valtrex daily combined with the use of condoms makes the possible transmission rate come down to 1.9%

It sounds like you're talking about the transmission risk per *year* based on sex twice per week, but are presenting that stat as if it's the risk per *encounter* (since you didn't specify otherwise). Here are the stats for genital hsv2 transmission, within the constraints stated:

---

**Male-to-Female Ghsv2 transmission risk:**

In studies of couples in long term relationships (ie together at least 3 months already) where the man has genital hsv2 and the woman doesn't and they both know he has it, if they have *unprotected* sex for an entire year (approximately twice per week) except during outbreaks, and the man takes no herpes medication, the woman has about a 10% chance of becoming infected by the end of the year.

Having sex more or less often than twice per week would raise or lower that base figure accordingly. Also note that that base figure comes from studies of couples already in long term relationships, and herpes is slightly more likely to transmit when the partners have been together less than 3 months. We aren't sure exactly *how* much higher the risk is before the 3-month mark, but we know its definitely higher. We also know that herpes is more active when the infection is recent, eg during the first 6-12 months of having it (the decline is gradual).

If the man takes daily herpes medication that would lower the risk to the woman by about 50%, bringing the annual risk from about 10% down to about 5%. Furthermore, condoms have been found to provide women with a very high level of protection from herpes, though not quite complete. One recent large scale study found that condoms reduce male-to-female herpes transmission risk by a further 96%. Herpes expert Terri Warren thinks that might be a *bit* on the high side, but not by much. So consider well over a further 90% reduction. So without condoms or medication, the annual risk to the woman is about 10%. With medication it falls to about 5%. With condoms but no medication it would be about 1%. And with medication *and* condoms it's well under 1%. 

**Female-to-Male Ghsv2 transmission risk:**

If the situation is reversed and it's the woman who has genital hsv2 and the man doesn't and they both know she has it, if they have unprotected sex for an entire year (approximately twice per week) except during outbreaks and the woman takes no herpes medication, the man has a 4% chance of becoming infected by the end of the year.

To reiterate: having sex more or less often than twice per week would raise or lower that base figure accordingly. And that base figure comes from studies of couples already in long term relationships, and herpes is slightly more likely to transmit when the partners have been together less than 3 months, or when the infection is still fairly recent (eg first six months etc).

Condom use and herpes medication would each lower the female-to-male transmission risk by about 50% further from whatever it was before. So if the couple uses condoms *or* the woman takes medication, the annual risk to the man comes down to about 2%. And if they use both, it comes down to about 1%. As you can see, men are at considerably less risk of catching herpes than women when no condoms are used. But men also gain considerably less protection from condoms than do women. ### This is great information. As I said, I was diagnosed last week, so I'm still reviewing facts and asking questions. I'm glad to hear that daily valtrex and the use of  condoms lowers the risk of transmission between female to male even lower than I'd thought.

No, that would pose absolutely zero risk. Your mouth or genitals would need to have direct, skin-to-skin contact with their genitals for there to be any potential risk of transmission. And if they don't have an outbreak at the time then the contact would need to be very considerable (ie considerable sustained contact as well as considerable friction) for there to be any risk at all and even then the risk would still be quite low.

If a person has genital herpes then you would basically need to engage in sexual behaviors with them for there to be any potential risk of transmission. Herpes can't be transmitted through water, or inanimate objects (eg a toilet seat, or a shared bar of soap in the shower etc). ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/te64qa/question/

But just get through your first outbreak and take care of your body and you should be fine! Don’t worry about oral sex causing more outbreaks.

tdx8rr,"Turns out I don’t have herpes… I’ve been under the information that I have had HSV2 for the past six months. I had never had any symptoms, but had had add with a few people without a condom. What happened was one guy I slept with wanted to be with me more seriously and I said no, and then he told me that I had given him herpes. Of course I was devastated, and just assumed I had it because he had told me that he had not slept with anyone else in a long time (and I had slept with other ppl without protection). I never got tested because here in the UK they won’t test you unless you have sores. So, I am now with my wonderful bf and we have sex with protection only. Butt something about the whole situation was bothering me - how unlikely was it that I would pass on herpes to someone I slept with maybe 3 times and I had no symptoms? 

So I bought a test online for £50, and it came back negative for HSV1 and HSV2. I am so relieved because it means I can have sex with my bf without a condom. 

That being said, in a certain way I am happy I went through this experience, and therefore wanted to post this. I have such respect for ppl who go through the stigma of this virus. I had to disclose to two sexual partners that I had it and it was nervewracking but also gave me such a sense of self respect. Self love is so much more than what other people think of you. And if the person is right, they will not care about you having herpes. 

On another note though - would you confront the person who lied to you? Bare in mind they were really upset when I ended things, I genuinely think they had malicious intent in telling me I gave them herpes.",12,2022-03-14 09:14:16-04:00,"Can't see what you get out of confronting the person.

Yes that persons evil for that, think they just wanted to play with your mind lol but congrats ### Can you share the name of the text you bought and where you got it?? Is it a blood test? ### Oh crikey… asshole move of her to ‘forget’ but if you used protection I’m sure you’re fine (I mean the chances of it being passed on if she had no symptoms is like 1-2%) 
But that being said IF you’re someone who rly worries about that shit then getting a test online to ease your fears is always an option! The one I got cost me £50 but it was certainly £50 well spent haha ### I had protected sex only once they lasted 2 minutes. Unluckily there was a hole in the condom. A month later i got vaginal sores.. begged him to get a herpes test he refused. Now I’m pretty sure i have it (got tested too soon so i have to wait after 3 months) it n i feel like everything’s ruined. ### Yeah ofc! It was off a website called ‘letsgetchecked’ and yes it was a blood test!

It’s a rly good system, you ‘activate’ the test, take the sample and send it off all on the same day. I sent mine off on the Friday I think and got my result on Sunday! 

It cost me £50 in the UK i am not sure if they work all around the world but I think they do! ### Well, it’s actually possible to forget if it doesn’t affect you daily. I forget it all the time when I talk to guys (I work in a pub) and then I remember “oh yeah, I should tell him if we see each other”.
I understand that it sucks getting told after and it could be because of egotistical reasons, but I also think it is possible to just forget. 😅 ### Yeah I was pissed but comforted her when she cried, such nonsense

Just got my results 2-3 weeks ago. Never had a single outbreak. I’m sure u don’t have it. ### the doctor was super un knowledgeable and interpreted my test wrong. she told me i was positive when one was negative and the other was equivocal, meaning confirmatory testing is needed to see bc it could not be determined. i’ve had an awful experience w this gyno practice office and will not be going back and she too recommended i get a second test, only after i explained the research i had found meaning she had not known about this prior. it really is sad that nurses don’t know how to interpret such a common virus and it causes so much people pain and agony over potential false positives myself being one of them. ### i’ve been with my boyfriend and only him for months and we use protection for sex. wouldn’t retesting just use the same test and give me the same results? ### as far as i know i hv not knowingly been exposed. hopefully ur results come back negative and i’m seeing the doctor today to talk about my results so we’ll see! ### Only say this because as soon as someone one is infected, it takes at least 12 weeks for someone to test positive for hsv on Igg.  Now the hard part, did you or you bf went out of your relationship? This is something to think about. 

Iast your Igm is in the false range and cdc states that IgM is not recommended for hsv testing due to the false positives. You can always go for the western blot test, which is more accurate but way more expensive. Or retest at 12 weeks from your last sexual activity. ### I’ve been tested 4 times since my knowledge of exposure. My IgM came back positive in December of 2021 (test #3) while igG remained negative. Fast forward to February 2022 my IgM came back equivocal and my igG remained negative for both types. So in conclusion I have had 4 negative igG in 1 year and never a single outbreak.

Does every girl I have spontaneously sex with just have to accept that she might get infected? And does my future partner just have to accept that she will end up getting it?

Transmission is different for everyone but it’s best to always disclose. I got it at 19, was in the middle of college, and felt like no one would want to sleep with me again but you’d be surprised with how many people are okay with it when you disclose. As long as you use protection and take medication the rate of transmission is extremely low. As for having a relationship, someone who is really for you and loves you won’t have a problem with it! I know it sounds corny but over time with the virus you learn that to be true.

It’s difficult right now but things get better. You can live a long, happy, and healthy life with ghsv1.

I've never had a breakout on my mouth or genitals, but looking back I think I may have had something going on with my hands. 

Once when I was a kid, my entired hands started shedding skin. I'm not talking about small dandruff flakes, I mean big thick patches of skin, no blisters though. I always assumed it was from playing wayyyyy too many video games at the time. I never said anything and my parents never noticed. 

Another time like 5 years ago, I worked at a factory with a lot of chemicals. One day I developed a rash on the back of my hand. It was itchy at first, and eventually developed into clusters of blisters that burst (can't remember if I burst them or if it happened on its own) They kind of hurt too. I went to a doctor and he just assumed it was a chemical burn from what I told him. He gave me some type of cream and they went away after a few weeks. Not sure if the medicine had anything to do with it. 

I also noticed the back of my hands seems to dry out at times and I develop small blisters that really itch. I've mostly noticed it during cold weather , but maybe that was just my brain looking for a cause.

Since diagnosis, I disclose when the time is right. I am not the one to share my shit on the first date, I wait until there's potential of something happening. 

I usually have a good response, mostly thanking me for being honest and typically them not caring. One guy panicked some time into it and started to spiral so we discontinued contact. 

Very recently, I have started to see someone from my past. We had a SUPER FUN sexual relationship over 15 years ago, pre-herpes. I finally told him I have herpes and told him when he is ready, he can talk to me, that I am not going to push it.

Tonight, he stated he's hesitant, and I told him I am understanding, if he's not ready for my situation, he can walk away and I would not be angry, and I wouldn't be, not at him. He asked me about risks, even with condoms. I told him that I have had it for over 10 years, which kind of helps with risk but not much.

I told him that what frustrates me is the majority have it but don't even know because of various reasons. 

When it comes to stats and numbers, it's so conflicting depending on what website you find, which doctor you ask, which expert is in the chat. I told him condoms help reduce risk but not entirely because it's spread by skin contact. I threw stats at him that have been thrown at me several times but I did some reading and realized I am wrong. But again, depends on who you ask.

Im new to this ### Hey your strength is inspiring...I wish you all the best for this...I just got diagnosed and It's difficult to cope ### When my girlfriend and I started dating (she is gHSV2+, I am not) she suggested I get tested, because I could already have it and not even know about it. I had been ""tested"" since my last partner but I was one of those people who didn't realize they don't test you for HSV. Anyway, I was happy to get a proper blood test to find out if I already had HSV or not. I got a mail-in test from letsgetchecked.com and it was super easy. We learned I didn't have it and that was very useful to know. You could suggest he get tested himself. It would have to be 3 months since his last partner for a proper IgG test to detect antibodies. There's no down side to him testing. ### Standard std tests don't cover hsv unless specifically indicated... Because it's so common 😩 ### That's true. I could ask. It probably wouldn't hurt for me to get an overall test again myself. ### Also. I think it's great you decided to still date her despite the fact she has it and you do not.

May I ask what types of precautions you take? I know the same methods don't work for everyone, and as far as I know, I've never ""passed it along"" but I think a few of my partners already had it since they didn't seem bothered at all. Which sucks because they wouldn't have told me. One partner told me he never discloses because ""everyone has it anyway"" and was questioning me why I told him at all. ### As someone who gets a full panel test after every partner and yearly with my pap tests, and who has just recently learned that HSV isn't tested for, I am flabbergasted and angry AF. ### We mostly would use female condoms. Sometimes male condoms. Sometimes nothing. To be honest it's been a source of anxiety for me, and sometimes that anxiety makes it hard to maintain an erection. It's been tough.

The only people your herpes effects are the people you are sleeping With. Friends are supposed to be your support system and if you tell them your story they should not judge you And they will learn from you And your experience. Hell you May even help a fellow herpes person out becuase if someone discloses to your friend after you teach them about herpes they will be more understanding and knowledgeable about it. But that’s up to you. I’ll attach some links that have seemed to help people and if you need anything please dm me.I’ve had it for almost a decade at this point and have a pretty good handle on it.

This first link is info about a support group I’m in. All herpes people from all over the world we all share are experiences, vent , swap info and remedies, and just talk about life it’s an awesome place to be for sure.

Please reach out if you need anything!! I promise it gets bettertr ### 😬 so he has had chlamydia for 3+ years?

Good luck. This takes time and meeting people who are accepting of your status. ### You definitely need to end things with him cause that’s a lot of red flags ### It takes a while to get over I’m not gonna lie but it does get better with time, I promise. Do your research and it becomes less intimidating. As far as outbreaks go. I’m in daily antivirals, they decrease the risk of outbreaks and the risk of transmission. I use a spray called Dermaplast when I get outbreaks. You can find it in the pharmacy aisle, it helps numb things. Drink lots of water and having a healthy diet is good too. You’ll learn your triggers and how to manage it. You can also find @suzbubs on tiktok. She’s an advocate for herpes positive people and has really helped me accept my status. I’d steer clear of her comment section at first though because people can be mean; but she has very good videos. ### I hate to hear he lied to you.  I can imagine you’re hurt and angry.  

But!  Having a happy dating life with HSV is possible. There will be some rejections along the way, but I’ve met quite a few amazing people already knew about it, also had it, or were willing to educate themselves so we could have a relationship. ### 21F here. Definitely find out what strain you have. If he goes and gets tested and doesn’t specifically ask to be tested for type 1, it’s very very possible that they will not test him for type 1. In that case, he might assume that he’s negative. Id reach out to a trusted adult or friend. Start taking some supplements and maybe a daily antiviral if that’s something that you are comfortable with. I take 1g valacyclovir daily, lysine, red marine algae, and just some vitamins like vitamin c. I know that this can feel like the end of the world, but it really isn’t. HSV is so common, and so many people don’t even care. The stigma is the worst part, but when educate people on the virus they will most likely be accepting. And if those people still judge you, then they’d probably judge you for anything. Feel free to dm me if you’d like to talk, or if you want any resources. ### He gave me genital herpes and I also tested positive for HSV1 :( ### So, genital herpes can be either type 1 or type 2. If you tested positive for type 1, was that on the swab test? or blood test? if you do have type 1 genital, you probably got it from oral hsv1 (cold sores). I have Genital HSV1 ### ",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tdqiy8/how_do_i_get_over_the_initial_shock/
tdj01u,"I can’t stop crying I was finally making peace with my diagnosis and now I’m starting to worry about having some sort of other incurable disease.

 I’m worried that I might have lichen sclerosis which is terrifying to me. I don’t want sex to be painful and I don’t want the possibility of my genitals disappearing. I’m so frustrated and I’m having such a meltdown it’s making it hard to work on this paper I have due soon. I’m just tired. 

Ever since my diagnosis I have had so many different changes going on to my body and it has caused me to panic. Since my diagnosis I’ve had about SIX different health scares and possible illness. All supposedly unrelated to herpes, but guess what? I didn’t start having any of these symptoms until my first outbreak. 🙃 I don’t even blame the herpes at this point and I would honestly be elated to find out that this is the only problem. I swear if I get checked out and have confirmation that it’s just herpes I’ll be able to move on with my life. I will be grateful! 

For clarity, I have been officially diagnosed with HSV1 via swab. But I’m concerned because my labia has began to lighten in color, and one side of my labia has drooped lower than the other. This all happened during the beginning of my first OB in December and it still looks like this. I was told by a nurse that it would eventually go back to normally but now I’m not so sure. I’m worried because from what I’ve seen the symptoms of a herpes OB and LS or very similar. Also my herpes symptoms are atypical which complicates things....

During the first OB I had bumps on my labia that were swabbed...

As my OB progressed, I noticed tiny tears on my anus, which I believed to be the herpes outbreak. I only notice them when using the bathroom and they itch and sting a little and make it sensitive to wipe. It heals really fast.

I’ve now learned that is also a symptom of LS. 

I’m just so tired of feeling like a prisoner in my own body. I’ve never had so many health complications at once in my life. I don’t even recognize myself anymore.",3,2022-03-13 19:02:09-04:00,"Hi!

If you do have it, I promise you it’s not the end of the world, not the end of your sex/dating life and so many people have the virus.

tddbo9,"My friends are acting like I can’t casually date with herpes For context, my (22F) thing this year is that I’m not going to get into a serious relationship because I want to experience being single and developing my hobbies. 
For the past four months, I’ve been casually dating (swiping on dating apps, going on a few in person dates, a couple of hookups), but nothing serious. Was recently diagnosed with genital herpes and I told my close friends (20-22FM) about it. They were accepting, they asked me questions, I gave them answers. I thought the conversation went well and they understood that it wasn’t the end of my life, I could have a normal love life and just be upfront/disclose and take precautions. 
Then today I sent a screenshot from Hinge (complaining about what the guy was saying, unrelated to my diagnosis) and suddenly it was this big like “well maybe you should stop dating for right now/etc”. The only thing that has changed is my diagnosis. I called them out for it and was pretty much like “I’m still not getting into a serious relationship, but I can exist as a HSV+ person outside of a serious relationship”. They apologized, but it made me feel so crummy. 

Has anyone else had this experience?? Finally got over the initial shock of “I have to be in a serious relationship for anyone to accept my status” and they kind of knocked that down and now I feel like I shouldn’t be casually dating or even on the apps. Just feel discouraged.",10,2022-03-13 14:39:23-04:00,"Booo!! 🍅 
You are still a human being capable and deserving of having a fulfilling life. And honestly some dudes don’t care (which I mean if they don’t ask one question I’d be leery) but and educated person will learn. 
Love ya life girl!! ### Yeah this why people struggle telling others. Can’t tell you to get new friends but I can say give yourself some space cuz they suck right now. ### Lol they probably haven’t even gotten tested themselves ### There's actually a few people in this sub that try to push that narrative as well. 

And I am 32 and I prefer being single, doing causal dating and hookups. I really don't see myself ever really getting a partner because I prefer being single.

When I was first being diagnosed, I had like 6 sex partners at the time and two of them told me, ""well, here's your sign to get a life partner.""

#FUCK THAT.

I'll continue being a slut, just a bit more responsible one. I still have three partners I am currently playing with who also have other partners they play with. Everything is peachy. ### I feel like sometimes ppl/friends just don't know what to say because they haven't got it themselves so they'll never know what it's actually like ### But it’s all in a very passive way and they are using my promise to myself (not getting into a serious relationship for a year) as the issue when it’s really not the issue for them at all if that makes sense. Literally the only thing that has changed is my diagnosis. ### That’s what I told them when I disclosed my status to my friends and it seemed like they understood? And now all the sudden that I’m still living my life (in a safe way!) they have something to say and are acting like no guy on the apps would ever accept my status. Just weird and came out of left field for me. ### Yeah—I’m a very slutty person lol. 

I disclose to my partners, depending on the activity (I’m a queer AFAB person, and I top, so often my pants stay on or I use a strap, and there’s no risk of transmission of GHSV in many circumstances). 

But I’ve had at least 10 partners in the year since I’ve been diagnosed. 

You can date casually. You can have casual sex—there are so many options for ways to ethically have sex and relationships post-diagnosis.

HSV doesn’t mean you’re on the shelf or need to settle down. 

It means you need to practice safer sex, inform your partners, have good communication, and take charge of your own health so that you know when you’re safe to play and when you might not be (or so you can help make sure everyone involved knows what the risks are) 

Just bear in mind that being positive for HSV means you’re at an increased risk for contracting HIV from an HIV pos partner—so make sure everyone is tested regularly and to use condoms where necessary. 

If you know your partner is HIV+ get on PrEP and make sure their counts are low—U=U.

OP—your friends are wrong! ### They’re projecting. And not even projecting they are judging(my opinion) cause honestly it’s none of their business. As long as you are disclosing what goes on with ya coonchie is your business. They aren’t servicing it lol ### Because they wouldn’t. They may turn into haters/jealous if you keep pulling. I assume you’re young. I’m proud of you. You’re a whole vibe. I wish I was as brave as you when I was young but I was afraid of people like your friends. It’s narrow minded. And while it’s definitely a proportionate size of the population, too many people aren’t tripping who are great people for you to concern yourself with this behavior. But be careful who you tell. They may work against your confidence. ### ",12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tddbo9/my_friends_are_acting_like_i_cant_casually_date/

tdqpv1,"Rejection after disclosure advice I (25F) recently got back into dating after ending a long term, rather toxic  relationship. The thought of having to disclose my HSV2 status to new potential partners was always my nightmare. It’s honestly a reason why I stayed in my previous relationship longer than I should have, to avoid this confrontation. I felt like no one else would accept me. However, I started talking to this guy on bumble a few weeks ago. We really hit it off after a FaceTime date, so I decided to disclose to him my positive HSV2 status. He was initially super nice about it and we ended up meeting in person. Night went on, and after fooling around a bit (no sex), he seemed very apprehensive about my HSV2 status. I completely understood if he was nervous, and wanted to respect his boundaries/anxieties. Aside from that we had a really good rest of the night. We texted sparingly the next day, but I haven’t heard from him since. Additionally, I saw that he unmatched me on bumble. I just can’t help but feel that my HSV2 was the main factor in this. If it was, I completely understand. However, I just don’t want to feel like flaming pos because of this. I really hope it was just my personality or something. What do you all do to make yourself feel better after rejection due to HSV status?

TLDR: Guy who seemed initially ok with HSV2 status has quietly ghosted me, can’t help but wonder and feel like shit",10,2022-03-14 02:13:12-04:00,"Well if its any consolation this happens with regualr guys, date hang out , no sex and ghosted >.> ### Dating in these days are rough even without complications you can be ghosted don't give up hope ### sigh. I definitely agree with the other comments that it happens regardless to people which is hard to remember when something in your brain in bright letters is telling you that this disease is the reason. And it becomes the reason why some of us ultimately are unable to accept ourselves because a romantic partner won’t. 

This is a slippery slope friend. I was in a very similar situation to you and I definitely don’t have the answers and feel the ups and downs of the emotional/mental impact frequently. But honestly time and surrounding yourself with a good support system (whether anonymously online or in person friends) is a great way to start healing. it helps you remember to also live your life like a normal person most of the time, which is what we are! we have baggage just like anyone else- yea maybe it’s heavier but we’ll just have to find some strong people 😉

All the best, and PM if u ever need an ear ### That guy clearly... isn’t worth you worrying over :)
The right guy will accept you. For you! (I’m a girl hmu if you want to talk) ### Hey I’ve been ghosted after disclosing and having sex becuase guys are pieces of shit on the dating app so maybe it was cause of hsv maybe not. Sounds like you dodged a bullet either way. Even if  he ghosted you because of hsv he should have told you. It’s really shitty to just ghost. You did the right thing and disclosed to him the least he could do is tell you that he’s not interested. Him ghosting you shows you that he is immature and unable to have an adult conversation which to me anyway is a big ick. If you need to talk my dms are open or if you want to join a support group with other hsv people let me know! ### I agree with this.  People ghost, fade off, reject all the time without an STI even being part of the equation.  Because we ALL fear rejection and want to know why we've been rejected, it's so easy to assume it's because of what we've disclosed, but without them saying so directly, we really shouldn't assume that that's the reason why.  I say ""good riddance"".  You want someone in your life who is sex positive in every way, non-judgemental, compassionate, and willing to learn and educate themselves. ### Yes I feel very not normal a lot of the times and trying to shake that. Don’t want to feel hopeless forever. Thank you :) ### Thank you😊 ### I’m going to work on seeing it that way! Thank you :) ### Exactly 💯  you did the right thing and disclosed. He took the coward way out by unmatching you. It's his right to say no but he could of been mature enough to send you a message then go your separate ways. You did nothing wrong, and he wasn't the one. Unto the next. If it isn't herpes there's a ton of other yhinga that may he deal breakers for people,  that's just life right.

You need to see a doctor or at least notify them of your test results so they can call in a prescription. ### I think it depends on the country. 

I tested negative but my gynecologist still prescribed me valtrex or whatever the brand name is here I can’t remember. 

That said I haven’t lived in any country where you can go into a pharmacy with just a diagnosis. I am pretty sure they aren’t allowed to prescribe medication they just hand them out.

I’ve been diagnosed for just over a year and even on a daily dose of Valacyclovir still have regular outbreaks, likely as my immune system is not very good to begin with, even without the antivirals. 

I’m hoping that as the years go by I’ll have fewer outbreaks, but recently have been having additional symptoms—recurrent UTIs and some trouble with yeast infections that seem to coincide with outbreaks

Managing the yeast infections in particular is getting expensive as the OTC creams and whatnot are not covered by my insurance. 

Has anyone had experience managing these symptoms concurrently with outbreaks? 

Were there any lifestyle changes (like to clothing, activity, hygiene/ bathing routine, diet, etc) that helped manage yeast infections with HSV? 

I’m at a loss for what to do—initially I just kind of continued with “life as normal” with my outbreaks, and I’ve been lucky to have relatively non-painful lesions. 

But this is starting to be totally inconvenient. 

Idk if I need to give up on skinny jeans or say goodbye to denim entirely, buy new underwear, exercise in looser clothing, etc. 

I just know I can’t cope with a monthly outbreak that seems like now it’s inherently tied to a UTI/ yeast infection—and my doctor’s take on it has just been “well, you’re on the meds, and I can give you a standing order for antibiotics too!”",2,2022-03-14 01:22:52-04:00,"YES. It’s awful. The best thing ever is to buy this:  https://thehoneypot.co/products/herbal-7-day-suppositories

It’s boric acid with some other soothing ingredients. It keeps my ph balance in check and prevents the yeast from going crazy. I use it every time after sex, the whole week before my period (that’s typically when I get a yeast infection), and any time things feel “off”. Seriously, get this stuff — you will be so glad you did! ### How can I follow this because I have the same reaction and I was recently diagnosed ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tdpymu/people_with_ghsv_1_or_2_and_vaginasanyone_have/
td6zgb,"Was Anyone Else Angry At The Person Who Passed The Virus To Them? So, I contracted HSV 2 from someone I trusted. We weren’t a couple. But—we were pretty close. She and I had the same interests etc. I noticed something was “strange” if you will. 

She assured me it was nothing. She had bumps but promised it was from shaving. 

I ended up with HSV later down the line. I hated her, to be honest. Every time I tried to tell her, she’d tell me to just leave her alone and that I was obsessed with her. When, in reality, I was advising her to get tested. Not really sure how to feel about it. How did y’all move on?",27,2022-03-13 09:31:57-04:00,"My situation is a little weird. I had a partner who had his first OB/tested positive at the same time I had mine. Neither one of us knew who passed it to who, especially since after talking to every single previous partner we had both had, they said they were negative (some even got tested to double check, but not all). So we were both in the dark really. And I think that helped a lot with the anger part--since we were both going through it together? I haven't seen him or even spoken to him since though. And I still have what if its this person etc etc. I think it's really dependent on whether the person knew and failed to disclose or not. I am not angry because I am assuming all my partners are half decent and just don't know they are positive. That might not be the truth but it keeps me from staying awake at night over it. ### I think it's a normal reaction to have honestly. It all depends on situation. I don't know who I got it from, although I have a suspicion. I passed it on to my boyfriend, although I always kept open about it from the get go so he knew the risk, and even he was disappointed in me...🤷🏻‍♀️ ### [deleted] ### Nope. But I also don’t know who gave it to me. Either way I can’t be mad. There’s more people on this planet with herpes than without. ### It was my ex wife.  She never felt guilty about it.  Karma eventually caught up to her.  She overdosed on heroin.  No one deserves that.  I have been single for so long.  I don't know what a simple kiss feels like.  I can't be a person that doesn't give a choice.   Never get past the first meet up.  Statistics say we are many.  Where are all the women?  Even in my State(Ohio) even on site devoted to us.  The choices are minimal to none. ### What did you notice that was strange?? ### Are you certain they knew? A lot of people don’t know—and many women who shave assume that outbreaks are just ingrown hairs, due to lack of education. 

I would think that someone would genuinely want to know and not blow you off when you tried to tell them—I think that’s suspicious. 

I just know that the person I definitely got it from (I had a primary outbreak), acted oblivious. 

I’ve wondered about whether he genuinely didn’t know—and struggled with being angry myself. 

I waffle on whether he knew and was just acting clueless (something that seems like the kind of bullshit he’d do, honestly, knowing this guy) or whether he genuinely just wasn’t that aware of his own health and what was going on with his body. 

All that to say—I completely understand being angry.

But sometimes I wonder how cut and dried it is for the people who pass this virus on—I know that the vast majority of people who are spreading HSV are not aware that they have it at all.

ETA: I completely understand being angry with people who are fully aware they are HSV pos and don’t disclose—I feel that disclosure is necessary for informed, enthusiastic consent. 

If you know, imo, disclosure is a must.

RE what to do about that anger: I think it’s a journey. You don’t want to be stuck in the past and stuck on what someone else did to you—that can be miserable. But I’m not team “you have to forgive.” I think it’s important you find your peace with it—whatever that looks like. ### No because she’s asymptomatic and didn’t know she had it. Even if she did, holding onto resentment won’t help with the healing process so I would forgive and move on in that case also ### Yes. I am very angry. I feel like it ruined my life (but I am early in my diagnosis and I’m having constant symptoms). I am going after him for not disclosing to me even though he knew. ### Yeah, in my case my person knew and did not disclose. I traced back every partner. But it’s fine I’m not angry anymore. ### I’m sorry that happened love. It will get better for us both I’m sure. ### She had bumps, but told me it was from shaving.

I’m only 22. Took a long time to get my confidence back after that. Wish she could’ve just been honest with me. I’ve disclosed several times.

Could you please clarify how you were tested? Ie swab test or blood test? If it was a blood test, was it an IgG test? And, if so, what was your hsv2 index value?

These matters are discussed on our wiki page on herpes testing: [LINK](https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/wiki/herpes_testing). ### 03/07 Pcr vagina swab my OB took some sample from the sores in my tight ### >OB took some sample from the sores in my tight

You used that word ""tight"" several times. Did you mean to say *thigh*? Are you saying that you had some sores on your thigh? 

Regardless, positive swab results are very highly reliable so it *does* appear that you have hsv2. 

>I was abused and he used to put his penis in my vagina. It’s possible it was herpes all this time? I was abused when I was 5 or 6 approx. I’m married (8 years, together 9) my husband just asked how and said he is in shock. I’m just overwhelmed with everything and the though of this being from the person who abused me just make it worse. 

First of all, a herpes diagnosis can often come as a shock. So give yourself permission to need some time to process this and learn about the condition.

Without knowing more about your situation it is extremely difficult to know the source of your infection. In some cases, it is *impossible* to know the source of one's infection. You said that you were abused when you were 5-6, but you didn't say whether you'd had any consensual sexual encounters with anyone other than your husband. It could have come from *any* of your past sexual encounters.  There's also a chance it could have come from your husband. Herpes is less contagious than most people realize and some couples, where one partner has it but doesn't know, can be sexually active for years before transmission occurs.

You said:

> I mentioned her that I had a itching in my tight that I had a long time without having them.

And it isn't clear what you meant. Are you saying that you've experienced very similar itching and sores like this previously? If so, how approximately how many times has this occurred? And how far back do you remember this occurring?

The best course of action would be for your husband to get blood tested to see whether he has hsv2 himself. If he does then there would be no need for the two of you to engage in any precautions when having sex together since you both already have it. But that wouldn't necessarily clarify whether he is the source of your infection or whether he caught it from you. ### First of all, sorry for this messy post. I have so much in my head and tried to do a Yes, and I meant thigh. English is not my first language. Sorry about any other mistake.  I had previous partners, but we used condoms. I remember having itching since being ten years old or before, and they were at least once a year. I never associated it with herpes since I didn't have intercourse or other sexual activity until almost 20. I told my husband to get tested. I think that just the thought of herpes coming from the person that abused me kind of has my head spinning. Anyway. I’m waiting for my doctor to prescribe me the medication. ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tdolir/hsv2_positive_i_think_it_was_from_my_abuser_when/
tdjkrq,"Can HSV-1 lead to genital outbreaks? Hello! 

I'm 19 years old and have had HSV-1 since I was a kid. My mom frequently had cold sores so it was basically inevitable. I almost never get any cold sores so I'm not bothered that much but I recently noticed something in my genital area which I'm suspecting that it might be a herpes blister. Now I'm wondering if I can get an outbreak down there from simply having HSV-1.",7,2022-03-13 19:30:40-04:00,">Now I'm wondering if I can get an outbreak down there from simply having HSV-1.

No, an oral hsv1 infection would be limited to causing symptoms on the face. For symptoms to occur genitally, the genitals themselves would need to be infected. And it is very unlikely that your genitals have been infected with hsv1, given how long you've had oral hsv1 for.

Once you are infected with a type of herpes in one location, you become largely protected from getting infected with the same type of herpes in another location at a later point in time, whether by spreading an existing infection on yourself, or getting exposed to a partner's infection. This is because after you are infected with herpes, your body creates antibodies to fight the virus. Your body maintains these antibodies in your bloodstream and they protect you from further infection. Different people generate antibodies at different rates, but by about 4 months post-infection the vast majority of people will have enough antibodies to prevent any further infection by the same type. Many people will have sufficient antibodies a lot sooner than that (eg after several weeks).

There are very rare exceptions to the above but that is the general rule. ### Why do you suspect it’s a herpes blister? ### Usually you can’t have an outbreak down there, with oral herpes already, unless it’s passed to you down there, you are still susceptible to HSV 2 from others. You can also pass hsv-1 to someone else orally or genitally. ### Mainly because it simply looks like what I've seen on here but just very faint. I mean imagine you look down at your private parts and suddenly see something that's not supposed to look like that. It's whiteish in the center and as I said, like a rash to the touch. I'm gonna wait maybe it will get itchy but at the moment it's not. ### You sure it’s not like razor bumps? ### It's under the foreskin when I retract it so I'm sure it can't be that ### ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tdjkrq/can_hsv1_lead_to_genital_outbreaks/

Was also curious if anyone who was vaxxed and hsv1 positive had an outbreak after receiving the shots? ### PS. And for anyone else who might be reading, here's an excerpt from Page 15 of herpes expert Terri Warren's free book, [The Herpes Handbook](https://www.westoverheights.com/herpes/the-updated-herpes-handbook/). Terri has a 35+ year career researching and treating herpes specifically:

>IgM (a different kind of antibody) tests do not accurately
distinguish between the types of virus nor can they accurately tell
a new infection from an old one. IgM tests also may pick up other
herpes viruses, like chicken pox or mono virus. IgM tests for herpes
should be avoided completely until better ones are available. Many
clinicians don’t realize that the IgM test is not good for diagnosing
people, and tell people, based on an IgM test, that they have herpes.
And not only that, they tell them they have a new herpes infection
because IgM, with other viruses, comes up early in infection. But
with herpes, IgG and IgM come up around the same time. The IgM
can be generated years after first infection and will be detectable
periodically. There are also commonly false positives on the IgM
test. A person might have an IgM test and four months later, still
be IgG negative. The IgG is the only test you ever want for herpes,
never ever IgM

So basically lots of false negatives, tons of false positives, plus the type-specificity of the test isn't reliable either. Basically, nothing reliable can be concluded about a person's herpes status based on their IgM results -- no matter whether they test positive or negative. ### >>So you've seen us say that the IgM is not an accurate test and should not be used for herpes detection, but you're asking us about the accuracy of your IgM test and whether it detected herpes?

tdikac,"gHSV1 and Transmission Hello,

I am a 23 year old man and just got diagnosed with gHSV1.  I think I’m on the tail end of my first outbreak. 

I have a question about transmission.  From what I have learned about online, it seems that genital HSV1 is somewhat easier to manage and has less of a chance of asymptotic transmission than HSV2 does.  I’m curious if anyone who has had this for a while has some insight on what the transmission likelihood is of me passing it to someone who doesn’t have it if I’m not presenting symptoms.

Also, I’ve gotten a lot of mixed advice on whether or not HSV1 is something that needs to be disclosed.  Obviously my doctor advised me to disclose, but I have family members with gHSV1 who said they have never disclosed unless they’ve been in a relationship, as they would just choose to not have sex if they were having an outbreak.  Just looking for some advice on this new lifestyle.  Thanks in advance",30,2022-03-13 18:40:59-04:00,"Non-present transmission is called viral shedding and most DEFINITELY can happen. Recently a girl who I really cared for and I had unprotected sex quite a bit over the span of a 3 day weekend around 2/27. I had no idea that I was a carrier and WISH that I would have known because I passed this all off to her and now she isn't speaking to me and is unfortunately in quite a depressive state of mind. I had never had any lesions, bumps, cold sores or even had the typical 'first OB' cold flu symptoms to my knowledge. Before her, I had taken quite a lengthy break from relationships and sex due to quite a toxic relationship (2016 timeframe) and my last blood test was around 2019 when I had an appendicitis which all came negative for whatever it was that they tested. They said it was a STD/STI test. I don't even really remember much because I was hopped up on drugs from surgery but I do remember the conversation happening and I made a dumb joke like, "" Oh thank god that can be the last of my worries then. "" So I don't even know where the hell I got it from, I could have gotten it when I was younger and it stayed dormant, a past relationship many years ago.. I still often find myself getting a little frustrated at not knowing who or when it was passed off to me.

Her and I both had an OB at the same time, hers was most certainly worst and more painful for her.

I would 1000% ALWAYS disclose that you have it no matter what because you have no idea how HSV will effect the other person. ESPECIALLY if you care for them you do not want something like this to spontaneously occur in the middle of your growing relationship and then have them get mad, upset and get sent into a depressive state of mind. Please disclose, let them know but don't just say something like, "" I have herpes "". You've gotta go into with confidence, show some study links and link some youtube videos that talk about HSV and the stigmas. If someone is worth your time they will educate themselves, look into it and most likely be okay with it since so many people have HSV in some way shape or form.

Put yourself in that person's shoes, this could be a deal breaker for some ( even though it shouldn't ) and imagine how much more damage it might bring an early relationship versus just being up front a few dates into the relationship before actual major commitment happens.

I've been struggling with my diagnosis quite a bit these past two weeks and bookmarked quite a few videos for if she ever does end up wanting to talk about all of this and these links definitely helped me stress a little less over all of this.

Thank you for the amazing info that you provide to this group! :) ### I was just visually diagnosed by an ER Doctor, she looked down there and said yeah that's definitely herpes and then my general practitioner looked and agreed as well, they didn't want to do blood work at that time because you can get a false negative when it's too early in the OB due to your body not building up the antibodies that it creates to fight off the virus.   
I just recently learned that you can get a culture swab test which at the General Practitioner which is kinda making me annoyed because she never once suggested it. Almost at the point of finding a new doctor because all she pretty much told me was to use a condom and to not worry because so many people have it. But I do go in for blood work sometime the first week of april to get my actual test, but being told by both doctors that it definitely looked like herpes. Not sure about the person I gave it to though, since she 'needs her space' and doesn't want to talk to me right now so I don't know what tests she's had yet.   
Assuming it's HSV1 since the sores were very small and subtle. So basically I just get to live and stew in the constant fear of not fully knowing what this REALLY is until I guess I get the results back.. which i've also seen are not extremely accurate. ### Because she had all the first OB flu-like symptoms and I didn’t when I had my OB. So I’m just assuming it was me and I must have had an OB at some point in my life and just shrugged it off as a cold or the flu. I’ve read that people have had a first OB and it was only 1 lesion or sore and it showed up on their inner thigh/butt cheek/ect and assumed it was a pimple or in-grown hair. Which maybe I’m wrong, maybe you can get the virus and never have those symptoms for the first time because everyone is different or have the virus for a long time and then get your first OB and then have the symptoms. She said she was tested for everything 5-6 months ago after her last relationship and all came back negative. And as most of us have done research those tests definitely can come back false negative. But all the signs definitely point towards me which if it was me I’m alright taking that fall and being the scapegoat in the situation. ### This is the average asymptomatic virally shedding rates for those who have GHSV-1.

Also statically, you have an 88% chance to not have another outbreak during your next year and then it goes down to 50-something-% chance of not getting another outbreak during your 2nd year. ### 15%-30% ### 15-30% ### I can't find the link but it was referenced from Westoverheights.com, the forum that is run by Terri Warren who is a Herpes Specialist, where she often answers questions about this. ### And neither of them disclose? ### Gotcha.  Next time you have an outbreak I would definitely get swabbed! Would give you some peace of mind.  I definitely have more peace of mind knowing it’s hsv1 and not hsv2, as I’ve heard it’s a bit more manageable ### So she tested negative at 6 months? Was she taking antivirals ### Thanks very much for the info! ### awesome, thank you! ### The both told me that whenever they were in a relationship they would of course disclose, but if they were meeting someone for the first time and having an outbreak they would just abstain.  Not saying this is the right thing, it’s just their experience ### Yeah that is 100% the plan for next OB. Yeah from what I've seen it's totally manageable and something people shouldn't be on total freak out mode for.

My little sister's friend has had HSV1 since middle school (15+ years) and has a completely normal sex life with her boyfriend of 3-4 years. He gets tested once maybe twice a year and is still negative for herpes. They have unprotected sex all the time, she takes her daily viral suppressant medication and if she starts to ever feel any tingles she tells him immediately just so he knows and is aware. She told her that she doesn't even think about having herpes anymore and in fact hasn't had a full blown OB in over 6 years. She takes the daily suppressant, L-Lysine and Zinc to help with her immune system daily, eats somewhat healthier and works out 2-3 times a week. So many people live their daily lives with this virus. It's not the end of the world, just a little hump in the road that you gotta get past once and awhile. ### No she tested negative for all STDs/STIs 6 months ago. We started talking 2 months ago had sex 1 month ago. We both had our OBs around 3/1 maybe 2/28. ### Did she test hsv back then? Do you have evidence? ### No idea she texted back maybe 2-3 times since our diagnosis 2 weeks ago. Told me she needs time to think about all of this and blocked me on her social medias. Texted me a week ago to tell me her OB is pretty much over but now she’s in a deep depression and just wants to hermit up and be left alone. And I know you don’t get tested normally for HSV on most STD panels unless you ask so she definitely could have had it prior as well especially if she didn’t ask. Never had a chance to ask her, but in all seriousness I am not here to point fingers. What happened happened, there really isn’t much her or I can do or change. Just gotta move on and keep living. ### Yeah all will good. Hsv existed before our lifetime and will continue to exist after. ### ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tdikac/ghsv1_and_transmission/
td88qp,Question for ya’ll Do those of you with hsv2 or ghsv1 still shave with no issues? I’ve only shaved like twice after being diagnosed and omg its like my skin was way more itchy/irritated after it despite having no problem prior to the Herpes! It’s like the skin down there reacts differently now,9,2022-03-13 10:37:52-04:00,"I’ve shaved a couple times since my first OB cleared up, i haven’t noticed anything too different. Sometimes I’ll feel like a tiny itch and then get paranoid it’s prodromal sensations. ### I feel itchy EVERYWHERE but idk if it’s mental or i’m seriously always itchy :( ### I have hsv1 and I shave still. I make sure the blade is newish. I always let hair grow out longer than what I used to and try to get rid of most if not all hair bumps or any of that sort. That way I when I do shave again I won't have some sort of razor burn. I stopped using stuff like Nair...100% aloe vera also helps ### I completely stopped shaving as it was an OB trigger for me. ### I always wondered this. What about waxing have you guys waxed? I’m a majorette dancer and we wear body suits often so I can’t imagine not shaving down there or everyone would make fun of the bush :( (I’m in my initial OB currently so I haven’t shaved yet). Plus what about having sex not everyone likes a full bush either. ### Yep.  The way you describe it is exactly what I have now. After you shave you get tickles and whatever but now after I shave, it feels like I’ve got needles in my underwear or something. The skin is just completely different all over down there, even though there’s no sores or blisters ### I waited a week after my blisters were 100% gone. Try shaving in the direction of hair growth, it’s less irritating in my experience. If you want a really close shave, I’ve shaved w the direction of hair growth using shaving cream, then “against the grain” while pulling the skin taught with just water. ### Yes I still shave my pubes. I dont break out often so i dont have that problem. It's just certain times that one particular  spot feels a bit more itchy, so I try to wash the area with ACV when I'm showering. ### ",8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/td88qp/question_for_yall/

tda49q,"How do I safely have physical intimacy with a partner who has herpes? There’s quite a background story to all this, but, I’ll deal with the backlash. I’ll also give an abbreviated version. I am married and I met a man here on Reddit. He is also married. We were physically intimate once and it was truly amazing. We share very strong feelings for one another and will be seeing one another again. 

After we were physically intimate, he disclosed that he did std testing and it showed hsv1 positive for the first time ever. He retested, and indeed he is positive for hsv1. His wife, of many years is hsv2 positive so he regularly tests. They do not use condoms, but are only intimate when she isn’t showing symptoms. Of course, I thought it must’ve have been me. Although I’ve never tested positive. I had also never been with another man outside of my marriage. I did my full std testing and everything was/is normal. 

Please don’t judge me on my choices, you don’t know my complete situation. I do not by any means want to contract something, nor pass anything to my husband. I know the safest thing to do is break things off. So, please don’t tell me that. 

I will be seeing this man again and we both know what the results are. I have so many questions. This man is incredible and I don’t want his results to negatively impact our situation. 

Can we be physically intimate? I know I can’t kiss him on the lips. What about kissing other parts of the body? Cheeks? Neck? Oral sex will not happen. What about vaginal sex with a condom? I’ve read about skin to skin contact can cause transmission, but is that through saliva only? Can I even safely hold his hand? Please help.",22,2022-03-13 12:10:29-04:00,"Get a divorce ### So you will not kiss ? What’s the point ### Depends where he has hsv1. If it’s orally kissing his lips could be a chance of transfer, but the rest of his body you can. Vise versa if he has it on his genitals. Hand holding, skin to skin contact isn’t really an issue. Make sure you and him are aware of any tingling/outbreak signs, use protection till you find out where he has it. Ask if he wants to take suppression ex valtrex to minimize the chance of you getting it. ### Chances are your full STI test didn’t include a herpes screening unless you explicitly told them “I want you to check for herpes/ HSV antibodies” 

Herpes usually isn’t included on a standard STI panel. 

It sounds based on your other comments like your husband has HSV1. 

I would get retested, if I were you. ### No disrespect, but your comment isn’t helpful. Unless you’ve been in my position, you wouldn’t understand. Maybe when you’re older, you might. ### What’s the point? Feelings. ### Thank you for your response. I thought hsv1 was always identified as oral and hsv2 as genital. I’m not sure he even knows where he has it. He’s never had an outbreak. He said this is the first time being positive for either herpes. I do believe him. He regularly tests because of his wife being positive for hsv2 (she was positive before they married). Thank you again, kind stranger. ### That’s what I’m thinking as well. Thank you for your reply. It did include it. Matter of fact, the results of it are supposed to 97% accurate. ### No problem. Hsv1 is normally oral, but can be gen. Have you or your husband ever had a cold sore? ### I have never had a cold sore. Once in a blue moon my husband will have one. He’ll use Carmex and then it’s gone. ### That’s hsv1. Probably how you got it. You might be asymptomatic. ### I don’t have it though. It would’ve shown in the blood tests. Or am I wrong? ### You can be positive and it not show up in tests. First hsv is usually not even part of a normal. sti panel , so are you 100% sure you actually have been tested. Secondly if igg antibody test then it misses about 30% of positive cases. So you could be one of the false negative cases, especially if your husband has it and you have been exposed .     

Or this new partner has been with someone else in the months before you started seeing him. Can take several months for the antibodies to show up in the blood. ### Thank you for the info. I tested 6 weeks after I was physically intimate. Yes, hsv was included in the blood test. It was a ten panel std/sti test. I have no confirmation that my husband actually has it other than the rare cold sore and we have never kissed or done oral when he’s had one. But, sounds like I could have been a false negative. 
My new partner was with someone a month before he and I met. It was two months after meeting that he and I were intimate. ### Cold sores are hsv usually hsv 1 but can also present as hsv2. ( more uncommon ). 

Whether he has a cold sore ( OB ) or not , the virus can be spread thru asymptomatic viral shedding, which a person won’t know when it’s happening but are contagious .  

If your other partner was with someone else a couple months before , then it could have been that person who transmitted it also .  The time line also fits with that , testing. positive with igg test about 3 or so months after exposure to hsv1 ### Wow, ok. Thank you. I was told that if I was exposed, I should test 4-6 weeks after possible exposure. No symptoms or signs with me. Just that negative test is all I’m going on. ### Can take up to 12 weeks to show positive, but there are the false negatives with igg. ### Is IgG testing different than testing at a lab? Mine was done through a lab. ### Only thing they can test if you are not having an out break is your antibodies thru a blood test. Igg or igm , and only igg is the one they should be using. as igm isn’t accurate for hsv. So unless you were swabbed for an actual OB , your result should have Igg next to it. ### Ok, thank you. I’ll check the result again. ### I checked and it does indicate igg. It also shows the three possible results of the test: negative results(no antibodies detected), equivocal(test again later because it could be early infection), or positive. Mine is just identified as negative. Looks like I should test again to be sure. ### Yes. wait the 12 weeks .  No harm. ### ",6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tda49q/how_do_i_safely_have_physical_intimacy_with_a/

I had my first OB 2 years ago so of course I went to the ER and a Dr. LOOKED and said it’s Genital Herpes. I cried, my son had just turned 1. I went back to the WR and demanded a test the same DR. told me there wasn’t one. So I demanded another Dr. This Dr. tells me they can do a swab or a blood test I insisted on both and refused to leave until they did them. I get my results back and they are both negative and I was really confused. Fast forward to now and I’m still having these OB but because of what was said I’m just so confused. I asked a Dr about them at Planned Parenthood and she said that it’s most likely that I’m undetectable that may be why it didn’t show up on the tests. The first Dr. had given my meds and they had worked so IDK. I don’t know what to think. Also, my bf proposed 3 months ago and I told him, he doesn’t care and loves me anyway. What should I do?",8,2022-03-13 17:00:08-04:00,"Take a blood test and see if you're positive now, but. Tbh. You r life seems to be going great.

If it brings peace to your mind go get a blood test, decent chance it will be positive, but at least then you're certain. ### Did you have flu-like symptoms? For sure doctors know herpes pattern, just looking like my case, visual examination says it's herpes + meds are dealing with it, so it is herpes. You probably got one of the 3 known meds of HSV.

Anyway, don't panic, your BF is accepting this! You passed the hardest part of it 👍. We all here wish that we can pass this part as you did!

Good luck 😄. ### I think I’ll do that. I’m just so scared and being in limbo is stressful. We’ve only had one sexual encounter and it was terrible because I was so scared. That was a year ago. But being married it will be different and he wants kids. I’m so stressed. ### I was really sick right before but it might have been because of my OB but idk there was a stomach virus going around at my moms. I don’t know how this will effect future child births. ### He knows the risk. Start worrying about being the best person you can be, and stop worrying about things you can't change. Use medication and no condom when you try for a child. A lifetime together vs ""some"" ob. ### Just relax, you're really doing better than us! Giving a birth is not that big deal, you have two options, take medications before 36 days of natural birth(doctors know better than me) or have a ""Caesarean"" if there is active OB during that time.

Anyway, I'm not medical advisor, it's just based on my readings, please keep in touch with your doctor and follow up.

I have been diagnosed for 10 years and have had  20+ partners since diagnosis. None of them to their knowledge have genital herpes some had cold sores. I am currently with a guy who is completely HSV negative he works at a blood lab and took a test just for shits and giggles.  He knows about my herpes I disclosed and he is completely fine with it and accepts the risks. There are plenty of people like this who do not care. Sitting around and waiting for a cure it’s silly you’re rejecting yourself before anyone even has a chance to think about it or reject you or accept you. You are putting limits on yourself before giving anyone else the opportunity to consider anything. People get rejected every day for a plethora of different reasons Sure there are people who ghosted me especially on tinder but as I talked to my friends I realized they got ghosted too and it wasn’t because of herpes it was because dating apps are cesspools in general. Dating nowadays sucks for so many reasons if you want to pin it on herpes go for it but that’s not the only reason. I was diagnosed with ghsv-1 at 19 and I thought my life was over I didn’t tell a soul cut off friends and everything because I felt so disgusting and gross. But eventually I put myself out there and had a few positive disclosure s and i began to realize that I was the one creating the stigma for myself.. The more people I told the less it weighted me down. Think of it logically friends should care because it doesn’t effect them. The only people your herpes effects are the people you are sleeping With. Friends are supposed to be your support system and if you tell them your story they should not judge you And they will learn from you And your experience.

Please reach out if you need anything!! I promise it gets bettertr ### Im right there with you ### Ready to go. ### Hey. I hear you—this virus, like any illness, can be hard to live with.

But you matter and your life matters. If you’re feeling this way and it’s mostly just in response to having HSV, I think that’s somewhat out of proportion—please reach out for help. 

A doctor can put you on suppressive medication so that you have fewer outbreaks and there’s a reduced risk of transmission. 

If you’re struggling with thoughts of suicide, there is care you can get for that too. 

If having HSV is affecting your mood a lot, it might also be time for some care around mental well-being, either medication or counselling. 

This is a very minor condition, as chronic viral conditions go, and it certainly is not worth taking your life. 

There are so many beautiful, good things to stay here for—don’t let herpes take them from you. 

Please. I hope you’ll choose to stay. ### You’re the only one that cares about hsv1 l. Nobody else does. ### I’ve tried at least 3 times and I hate myself for getting this I hate waking up in the morning.

You are so much more than the virus. ### How is ghsv2 any more difficult than ghsv1 ### I’ve had HSV1 for like 20 years and it’s never been an issue.  Nobody i’ve ever dated has reported ever having issues or symptoms.   I rarely had any myself.  

Now that I have type 2, i can only dream of the days when it was just type 1, but you are suicidal?  

I guess i don’t understand. ### Yeah seriously how is hsv-2 worse? It’s all herpes ### Less common, higher transmission, more outbreaks. Literally everything about it is more difficult. ### Yes I’m suicidal over the fact that I may have passed it on I can deal with having it myself just not the idea of passing it on ### When it affects the genital area you’re more likely to be rejected, sex doesn’t feel the same at all, difficulties urinating & constant pain and itching in ur genital area (including anus) sucks superrrrr baddd. & then u can occasionally get small mouth sores as well. ### [removed] ### This is not a reason to end your life.  Please focus on forgiving yourself.   I know it’s extremely hard.  I have done some things that I told God he should never forgive me for.  Things I told myself I’d never forgive me for.  We all screw up.  We all make bad decisions.  

The fact that you feel terrible is living proof that you’re a good person with a good heart.  And you are deserving of forgiveness. ### Im honestly just trying to make you feel better.

td9g5d,"HSV exposure vs infection  I read somewhere that HSV IgG tests arent always too accurate and you can get western blot for second confirmation, but above 3.5, there is little to no chance of a false positive. But I also read that igG test just tells that you either have an active infection, or were just ""exposed"" to the virus in the past. Is it possible for one to be exposed to either HSV or some other virus that results in the same antibodies, and NOT get infected? That is, can the virus make contact but the body's response makes it not infect any cells, not enter the body? Also, would a blood PCR test be accurate for confirmation? I can't get western blot here.   


 I recently got my HSV Igg and IgM tests. Apparently, this one doesn't mention the type, just gives the numbers. IgG 4.59 and IgM 0.50. I decided to get the test because a few weeks after a one night stand I noticed some tingling in the tip of my penis and some time after that itching on different areas of my body, but that feels more like a fungal issue.

You didn't get herpes from being fingered by him. ### When trying to find information regarding someone touching their bare genitals while they have herpes, then using that same hand to touch someone else's genitals and risk of exposure, it's nearly impossible to get a straight answer. 

I am naive and assume it's not much risk but others disagree and say it's super risky. Then people get all wound up thinking they'll get herpes on their fingers if they touch someone's genitals.

I don't know what ""brief touching"" means, but if it was really just a few seconds, I wouldn't worry at all. ### Thank you!! ### Yes it was like a few seconds because I try not to even have contact with partners genitals without condoms. And you said only contagious from the site of infection.. so that means if he touched himself with his left hand then immediately touched my vagina the virus would have died on the hand? Thank u. ### You're assuming first, that he had virus on his hand. If he didn't have an outbreak where he touched, you'd have to assume he was shedding. 

  
Shedding rates vary a lot, depending on the type they have - you can have genital herpes type 1 or type 2, as the number indicates the strain, not the location, how long they've had it, if they are taking daily antiviral medication to reduce shedding, etc. 

  
No one sheds 24/7 - not even close. The most shedding occurs in genital herpes in a brand new infection, within the first year, and that's 33% of days a year. So chances are still really good that he wasn't shedding. When shedding happens, it's not usually over an entire 24 hr period. 

  
So that said, would there be enough virus to even transmit on a finger? Not likely.   
If there was virus on his finger, it would start degrading/dying as soon as it touched the air, making it incapable of infecting you. 

Herpes - and other STDs - are not transmitted this way. ### ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tddq0c/can_you_get_herpes_from_being_fingered/
tdi8bd,"Igg negative result credibility after 15 weeks? Hi. Male 30.
About 17 weeks ago (mid November) I was having sex several times with a random girl for a period of two weeks. Only with condom except for oral she gave me withot condom (Also fingered her and all..).
About 15 weeks ago (end of November), after feeling stinginess in the penis urethra opening I saw it become red and one white blister that turned to two.
I went straight to a dermatologist that immediately said it's herpes. Gave me valtrex for 7 days and some antibacterial creme. After about 4 days the blisters passed. 
About 2-3 weeks after I finished the blisters (December) and the valtrex, I felt stinginess in my finger and that evening began a honeycomb rash that lasted for 4 days without special treatment (I only applied the same antibacterial creme I had from before) until it passed. 
After looking online a lot I am pretty confident it was herpetic whitlow.
Since the beginning, the penis stayed very sensitive for the next two months (If I touched it or tried to masturbate the skin would go red, sensitive and uncomfortable).
I was at the dermatologist two weeks ago (beginning of March) for checkup and everything is pretty ok but I showed him pictures of the finger and he said it's hard to tell but anyway I was sent to do IGg test which I did few days ago and got the results today.
The results were negative for both hsv1 and hsv2. 

I am very confused and buffled.
How should I react to it? What are the chances that its a false negative? Or perhaps I am misleading myself to think I have herpes when I actually don't? I would really appreciate any input.

No one here will be able to tell you how likely your symptoms were to be herpes from your limited description and lack of photos.

If you encounter any such symptoms again I would strongly encourage you to get them swab tested. 

Note that there are two different kinds of swab tests available for herpes: viral culture or PCR. PCR is newer and is much more sensitive than viral culture. Viral culture can be fine for pronounced, blister-type symptoms, and the sort of classic cold-sore-type blisters that herpes is known for -- especially if liquid can be extracted from the blister/lesion. But for less pronounced symptoms, or symptoms that don't have obvious blistering, or especially for symptoms that have partially healed, PCR is strongly preferable.

Note also that PCR swabs are less widely available than viral culture swabs. So if you think you would benefit from a PCR swab then call your doctor/clinic in advance to ask whether they offer PCR swabs for herpes testing before you make an appointment to go in. If they don't offer PCR then ask if they're aware of any local clinics that do, and try calling some other local providers.

You could also consider the Western Blot blood test. But blood tests are not able to specify the location of a herpes infection. ### Hi, thanks for the rapid response.

I have already read the wiki page regarding the test (and more). It only confused me more since the IgG test is supposedly rather accurate after the 15-16 weeks timeframe, and I was under the impression that I'm positive (testing was only formality and knowing the type). Don't get me wrong, I'd love to be mistaken and find out I was stressed for nothing...

Worth mentioning that right after the initial blisters I did full STD check, excluding herpes, that was negative to everything. 

Should I ask for a second IgG test in about a month from now or wait for another outbreak to be swabbed? I am really in uncertainty.

Thanks again. ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tdi8bd/igg_negative_result_credibility_after_15_weeks/

I am in a place I have always dreaded. When I was first diagnosed, I’d get on dating sites specifically for HSV2 & I’d see so many singles with it who were in their 50-60’s and thought dear god, I hope I’m not going to be one of those. Well here I am. Still single, having a much harder time to date or even get laid because of it. Everyone my age is either still married or doesn’t have it. Do I have to wait until there are more widowers? Or date much younger men? That I would be ok with, I seem to attract them from dating sites but the minute they hear HSV2, they are gone. Even though I put it in my profile. When I ask if they read the not so fine print, they don’t even know what it is. 

I moved here 17 years ago (Oklahoma City) from a small town. Mostly due to work but the hope I might find love. I had more sex in the small town, mostly men from neighboring states.

Because an hsv2 index value of 1.3, while technically positive, is actually considerably more likely to be a false positive than a true positive. This is discussed on our wiki page on herpes testing ([LINK](https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/wiki/herpes_testing)). 

>Im not really having any blisters. The skin under my foreskin is where it's effected and sometimes get reddish in colour.

Have you *ever* had blisters? Because lots of different things might cause reddish inflammation on the genital skin, specially under the foreskin and that alone is not very suggestive of herpes. It doesn't rule it out, but doesn't particularly suggest it either.

Herpes expert Terri Warren says that, statistically, an hsv2 index value of 1.3 has an 85% chance of being a false positive. Eg here's a post on her online forum where a client asked:

>I have had cold sores so the NP I see for my annuals tested only for HSV2 the igg level was 1.3. She called me and said that I had genital herpes. I have never had any symptoms or outbreaks. Is there a chance this is a false positive?

And Terri replied: 

>There is definitely an excellent chance that this is a false positive, there is an 85% chance this is a false positive in fact.

([Source](https://www.westoverheights.com/forum/question/confusing-results-help/))

So, based on what you've said so far, there is a considerable possibility that you don't actually have hsv2. 

In regard to your question regarding semen, as other users have already pointed out, semen does not pose a practical risk of herpes transmission. Direct skin-to-skin contact with the infected region is generally required. ### It’s just skin to skin. I’m not sure how your OBs are but I can usually feel it before it coming before I see it. If you think she might go down on you I would obstain until you know you’re over the OB if you just just stickin it wrapped up I think you’ll be fine. 
Are you disclosing? ### Wait. Skin to skin? So say someone had a cold sore and she goes down on a guy…and later has Piv it wouldn’t spread? Bc there’s no skin to skin ### Good to bear in mind that you also shed HSV cells from the skin of your scrotum (balls). 

There’s usually always skin to skin contact during sex, even with condoms involved.

You shed cells regardless of whether you have an active outbreak.

Condoms reduce the rate of HSV transmission, especially if you tend to be asymptomatic. 

But they don’t prevent it—largely due to the fact that people who are HSV+ shed cells from the entire genital area including the perineal and perianal area too.

Further—if you’re certain you’re positive and certain that you’re symptomatic, you’re shedding more cells between outbreaks now than you will in future years. ### Okay, thanks. ### Im honoured! First time in these years of reddit, a mod gave me some valuable reply. Thank you kind stranger. I got to this conclusion because i had contact with a high risk person, got the 1.3 as test result and i consulted a doctor. I also tested for all other STDs and all were negative. Anyway I'm also planning to get tested again for type 1 and type 2. So i guess i should reach to a conclusion only after seeing that result too. Again, thankyou kind stranger. ### What are OB’s? ### I have no intention of doing anything without wrapping it up. Also yes I'm disclosing. ### But this happens only if there were outbreak on scrotum atleast once right? For me, it has effected only under foreskin. ### >Im honoured! First time in these years of reddit, a mod gave me some valuable reply. Thank you kind stranger.

You're very welcome.

> So i guess i should reach to a conclusion only after seeing that result too.

Sorry, I'm not sure what you mean by this. If you were to test again and score another 1.3, that would *not* clarify things. If you were to test considerably higher, especially above 3.5, then that *would* clarify things and make it much more likely that you genuinely do have a herpes infection. This is explained on our wiki page on herpes testing: [LINK](https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/wiki/herpes_testing).

But remember that a blood test cannot specify the location of a herpes infection. That is problematic when (1) your genital symptoms are very ambiguous and not particularly suggestive of herpes and (2) you were given a non-type-specific test, so it could be detecting hsv1. More than half the population as *oral* hsv1, and a full 70% of people who have it don't even know they have it. If you have oral hsv1 then you could test positive on a non-type-specific IgG blood test despite not having a genital herpes infection at all.

Also, if you're concerned that the symptoms on the head of your penis could be herpes then you could have them swab tested for herpes specifically. That is another option here. But as I already explained, I suspect those symptoms are unlikely to be herpes. ### Outbreaks ### No, unfortunately, if you have HSV2 it can shed from any part of the skin on your genitals, whether you’ve had a lesion there or not, and sometimes from your mouth, although this is uncommon when you have HSV2. 

This is called asymptomatic shedding—it occurs constantly when you are positive, although the frequency of it decreases the longer you have the virus. ### Apologies for my late reply, since i decided to get tested separately for both types i though i would reply after the results come out. Looks like I'm having Type 1. In serum test for HSV 1 IgG, i got a result of 134 where >19 is considered postive. Other three tests were negative. I don't think im having it orally because nothing really happened in my life that could point to it. Also im coming from the part of the world where sex is considered highly taboo, so it mostly rules out the fact that i could have got if from parents or kisses when i was a kid. 
Anyway, i will be getting a swab test sometime in the future. Thank you for your valuable opinions. Brownie points for being a mod that actually takes time to write quality content. ### I recently got tested separately for both types and came out positive for type 1 only. So i hope it means I'm less prone to asymptomatic shedding? ### HSV1 has lower asymptomatic shedding rates, particularly if you have GHSV1.

You do still shed from the entire genital region regardless of where your lesions typically are. 

But yes, GHSV sheds less not just asymptomatically, but also when you have active lesions too. ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tdg4p0/does_herpes_spread_through_semen/

I have a new sexual partner that has herpes. She was very open about it with me before anything happened between us.

We discussed it through, and I realized that as long as she doesn't have an outbreak and I use a condom, the risk is very minimal. However, during our first encounter, although we used a condom, we got lost in the moment during foreplay, and she squirted allover, including on my crotch. 

I didn't think about this as a potential risk until afterwards. And now I've begun to  wonder if it's possible for her fluids to give me the virus without penetration.

Many people are unaware that cold sores can be given to partners gentials, and ghsv1 is fairly common. So if you already have oral herpes then at least you know she didn't give you that. But hey look you already a virus yourself and you're not an escort so doesn't mean she has to. But of course still possibility so get tested forsure. ### I don't see anything wrong with paying an escort for their services I think just be at peace you can get an sti from an escort and non escort. I understand an escort may have a higher chance of having something but people seem to be unable to accept the fact they didn't have anything. And look for any sign following the experience that they've got something from them. Look at the herpes sub reddit rarely any confirmed post about an escort giving them the virus. ### No I did not but it was only oral one way and no kissing. Sorry if I appear to be really uneducated on this topic. What is the best way to get tested I guess to swab the blister would not show anything since it hasn’t popped yet. Is blood test reliable 27 days post exposure. ### You can still go get the blister examined, I'm not sure if they're able to pop the blister for you and swab it and test it. But definitely go see a doctor while the blister is still present for accurate results. Again, I may be wrong and others have more insight just my suggestion if you have the ability to go see a doctor now. ### Thanks I will try and get an appointment, the local gum clinic closed during covid and is only running a clinic one day per week now which is absurd. ### ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/td8jwq/looking_for_some_advice/

td9c03,"Request for Advice and Support Hey everyone, as I'm waiting for my appointment to get tested, I wanted to ask for advice and support. I was just broken up with by someone and here is the story. I apologize in advance for the lengthy post, but I wanted to expose all of the details.


A month ago on a dating app I met a very very beautiful person, seemingly inside and out. Our values were aligned, our communication was stellar, and we genuinely enjoyed each other's company. After about a week and a half we became intimate. Prior to any activity, I asked if he was clean. He said ""yes, are you?"" I had just been tested with negative results for everything and said ""yes"". Halfway through, the condom was removed and then without communication or consent, he came in me. This bothered me and we discussed it and agreed it wouldn't happen again.


A week later after several other unprotected (with consent) events, my partner asked to talk to me. He said it would be serious and that he expected me to leave him. I was concerned and went into it with an open heart; I genuinely enjoy supporting people and wanted to be there for him. 


During our talk he started by saying he was an alcoholic. This seemed odd to me because he rarely drinks and he admitted ""that's what everyone says when I tell them"". I admitted that I didn't understand and asked why he drank. He said ""I had a partner that got me hooked on drinking. She also got me hooked on a medicine. A medicine that I have to take to feel clean that also makes me very depressed."" I wasn't following and pressed for more information. 


After about 10 minutes of elusive conversation, he admitted that two years ago he tested positive for genital HSV1 (but he didn't seem sure if it was actually 1 or 2). I remained supportive and believed him when he said that taking the pill once a week would prevent him from transmitting it to me. I really had never considered herpes to be lifelong. In my ignorance I thought it was something you experienced a few outbreaks of and that then went into remission with a healthy immune system. 


After doing more research, I felt deceived. I knew without a doubt that when I asked him if he was clean, that the first word that came to his mind was Herpes. But instead of disclosing this to me he still said he was clean. I confronted him about this and he apologized profusely, saying he didn't know it could be passed on without an occurring outbreak; that he genuinely believed he was clean. I sent him the peer reviewed scientific papers explaining otherwise and we discussed it in a very calm and understanding manner. 


At no time did I ever shame him or get angry at him for anything other than avoiding the truth when I asked him if he was clean before having unprotected sex. I forgave him and we continued to be intimate, but things felt different. He always wanted to remove the condom, to have sex more and more. We had an argument about something unrelated to herpes and he asked me if he had ever given me a reason not to trust him. I brought up not disclosing that he had herpes when I asked if he was clean. 


He proceeded to stand up, grab his keys, and walk out. He sent me a few voice messages saying that he couldn't be with someone who made him feel unworthy of touch and who made him feel unclean. He said ""I hope to God you don't have it, but I can't do this"". I felt awful, but also relieved. He is a model and made it clear earlier in the relationship that he can be with anyone, and that all of his friends who are girls would sleep with him given the chance. I had definitely felt stress because of this comment and I think regardless of Herpes it would not have lasted.


So at this point I am waiting for my appointment to get tested. I feel deceived and scared. I love meaningful relationships and value closeness, communication, and honesty. But I feel like prey because of my empathy and altruism.


TLDR; After several weeks of unprotected sex, my partner disclosed that they knew they had genital Herpes for two years. They told me they were clean prior to sexual activity. After a month, he broke up with me. Feeling deceived and uncertain.",0,2022-03-13 11:32:28-04:00,,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/td9c03/request_for_advice_and_support/
td22sj,"Is there any significance to the HSV test index values?

tcymjf,"Any long-term, discordant couples here? Please talk to me. Hi, all. 40+ year old male here. My girlfriend of 7 months is gHSV2 positive and I am not. (We are both HSV1 negative.) I was aware of her status before entering into the relationship and I did not want it to be a deal breaker for me, because I really wanted this to work. She has had it over 3 years, has never had an outbreak since her first, and takes antivirals daily. 

I understand that my risk is ""low"". It took me a while to come to this understanding, and for the first 5 months of our relationship we were extremely cautious in our sexual activities. Even though everything was fantastic between us, this was a great source of anxiety for me. Then in month 6 I got more comfortable, accepted that ""risk is low”, and we stopped using protection, agreeing that we would simply abstain (or play in “safe” ways) whenever she thought she might be feeling any prodrome signs. My anxiety subsided and things were going great. 

Then I had a health scare, and for a solid week and a half I (and she) 100% believed that I had contracted gHSV2. The details of that health scare are not relevant so I won’t go into that. Point is I don’t have it, but now I know how I would feel if I were to get it. I was not prepared for it. I have dealt with depression and anxiety before, but this was a level of existential devastation I had not dared to imagine. And amongst the darkness I felt regret.

I love my partner. I was not upset with her. I had accepted the risk. But now that I’ve been given this strange gift of knowing how I would feel if I got it, I don’t think I can accept the risk anymore. I want to have carefree sex with the person I love, without the anxiety of constantly wondering “is this the time I’ll get it?”, and that just doesn’t seem realistic anymore. 

I have been reading and re-reading all I can find on the topic. I realize we could be together for years without me getting it, or I could get it next week. I’d really like to hear real life experiences from people who are or have been part of a discordant couple, where gHSV2 is concerned. How long have/had you been together? Was gHSV2 transmitted eventually or not? If so, how much time passed before it was transmitted? Did the relationship last? How did all of these things make you feel, or how did your feelings change? I know there are people out there who have been in my position and gone through it, and I feel it would be so helpful for me to hear what their experiences are, rather than relying solely on numbers and odds derived from what few studies are out there. (Although those are certainly helpful too.) I am seeking more perspectives.

Thank you for reading. Thank you for being here.",12,2022-03-12 23:07:52-05:00,"I was one of those people. I was with my hsv2 partner (I'm female, he's male) for years, and it took me 6 years to get it. I was in my 30s. 

He'd had hsv2 for a long time - several years - before he met me, so he was shedding less than someone newly infected, so it probably took us longer than it might others.

I knew from the start that he had it, and took my chances. We didn't use anything for protection once we tested for other STDs. This was way back in the day, and we didn't know about suppression then. (For timing - my appt with my gyno to get diagnosed was the same day they had a luncheon with the GlaxoSmithKline people to learn about the results of the big Valtrex study. I was their first appt after their lunch.) 

It honestly didn't affect the relationship. I had friends who I already knew had herpes, and they had healthy, normal lives, so it just didn't bother me that much. 

If thinking you had herpes led you to ""a level of existential devastation I had not dared to imagine. And amongst the darkness I felt regret."", then I have to question what you think living with herpes is like, and what it represents for you, because it's a virus. No one died, there were no country invasions like Ukraine, or widespread tornadoes or floods wiping out a town. 

I don't mean to sound condescending, but if you're going to be in a relationship with someone with herpes, you need to figure this out. ### Hey, I don't think you should be with your partner. I recently tested positive but I've never had an outbreak. I feel my partner is a little distant and tbh it hurts. My result might be a false positive but when he makes me feel like that, it makes me like him less. If you're truly worried consistently, just leave her alone. 


People on here can just tell you the probabilities at the end of the day, there are no guarantees. You either like her enough to stay or don't. No in between. ### ...at 40+ age range ghsv2 is pretty common. Look up the statistics. ### Well I’m 42F and my husband is 46M.  So he has a lower sex drive and agreed its ok for me to satisfy outside of our relationship. Never thought about this herpes shit. I thought, I’m out of the danger zone age. Guess not. Met a new guy and he claims he did not know. Only gave him oral. Now I have hsv2, since Nov 2021.  I was so ashamed and angry that I did not tell my husband for 3 months, Feb 2022, because I kept going to the doc and they said I didn’t have anything. Finally went and got the antibody testing done and sure as sh!t positive. Told the new guy and never touched him again. 

Told my husband and he still loves me. I’m so disappointed in myself and I’m always worried for him. He prefers not to use protection and I’m not taking antiviral.  I’m watching him constantly for cold/flu symptoms. But in the end, I’m still the same person. And we still love each other. We’ve been together for 18 yrs and married now for 1. So happy he didn’t divorce me. But I’m still emotional about this whole situation. ### Whose to say you meet someone  else and get it from them because they don't know they have it or don't tell you. Sex is a risk. ### Thank you for sharing.

I also worry about death, Ukraine, and climate change. These things are not mutually exclusive. We are here in the herpes subreddit though.

You are of course correct that I need to figure this out. I know that my partner lives a perfectly healthy and happy life with herpes, as so many people do. And then I read about those that suffer from constant debilitating outbreaks. There's no telling which one could be me. And if I wind up in the latter group I fear what it could do to me and to my relationship. It's the worst case scenario, yes, but it seems I need to be able to accept it as a possible outcome. That's a tough pill to swallow.

You definitely struck a chord with ""what it represents"" for me. It is more than just herpes to me. I have been close to my partner for a long time. I am familiar with, and carry a burning hatred deep inside me for the man who gave it to her. (For many more reasons than one.) I want to leave those bad feelings behind and just be happy with her, but the herpes is a physical reminder that literally will never go away. 

It gets more complicated for me… We have a long history of friendship. Our history at once is a great strength and a detriment. We have shared so much, and we know each other so well, but I also harbor a lot of hurt feelings. (I am sensitive not to burden her with these feelings or cast blame.) To be clear, I love her a lot and we’re great together. She’s so goddamn wonderful. I could work through my own issues with therapy, but the permanence of the herpes feels like the straw that breaks the camel’s back. And that is heartbreaking for both of us.

Anyway, I remain grateful for others’ perspectives. ### Thank you for sharing your experience with me. ### Wow, that part totally escaped me. Good call. ### > Met a new guy and he claims he did not know. Only gave him oral. Now I have hsv2, since Nov 2021 ... I kept going to the doc and they said I didn’t have anything. Finally went and got the antibody testing done and sure as sh!t positive. 

This is very unclear. Are you claiming that you caught hsv2 by performing oral sex on your secondary partner? And why did you keep going to your doctor? Were you experiencing actual visible symptoms? And, if so, *where*? What were your symptoms? Were you ever tested by swab test? 

And in regard to your blood test, was it an IgG blood test or something else? If it was an IgG test what was your hsv2 index value? Did your secondary partner get tested and confirm that he actually has hsv2?

I'm asking all the above questions because, first, it would be very uncommon to catch hsv2 this way. Second, it would mean you have an oral hsv2 infection not a genital one. And third, oral hsv2 is the least active kind of herpes there. It would pose a virtually negligible risk to your husband when no actual outbreak is present. ### Carrying hatred for someone hurts you. It does nothing to the other person. I'm sure the man who gave your partner herpes deserves it - I don't know what he did other than herpes, but assuming he's evil and terrible and deserves it, all it's doing it hurting your soul. 

Your partner seems okay - you say she's happy and healthy. You don't seem nearly as happy or healthy. Maybe you could work on letting that go, not for her, but for yourself. 

You have hurt feelings, this hatred, anxiety - you should work through these things in therapy. You deserve to. Even if you don't end up staying with her, you deserve to heal. ### I did have a cold sore which lasted 10-14 days. I had thought nothing of it because I had one once about 10 yrs ago. But I kept feeling ill with flu symptoms. Also stomach pain and burning feeling in my back and vag.  I went to urgent care 3 times and the second visit showed the doc the small scab. They ran standard std testing and said I had bv and gave me antibiotics.  The symptoms continued after the antibiotics. Went through that 2 more times. My symptoms continued and I had chills and body aches. My gums felt rough in certain areas. I actually went to the dermatologist and got a PCR test, DNA swab of mouth, which returned negative. However that is used to detect current infections. So I’m guessing it is likely because the cold sore was healed and I wasn’t in a current outbreak. Then I reviewed all the testing on the hospitals app and noticed HSV was not listed in any of the results. And I started to Google if this was done in standard testing?! Learned it was not to my surprise!!! Went to a local pay test lab and asked for an antibody test for HSV. Came back positive for both. HSV1 40.5 and HSV2 4.19. I expected the HSV1 but the HSV2 no. So I had the new guy go get tested. By now we are about 3 months post oral sex. His results came back HSV 1 0.1 (negative) and HSV 2 3.5. (positive).

So he had the HSV2 and I got an oral blister. Prior to this I have never had any blisters vaginally. The misdiagnosing from doctors and having to go find testing myself was nuts. Makes me mad every time I think about it. ### All of this is true. Thank you. ### ",7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tcymjf/any_longterm_discordant_couples_here_please_talk/

Dont get me wrong, I agree what she did was WRONG but talk with your friends idk. This is suppose to be a supportive/informative page. You venting abt how you feel betrayed is not appropriate for this page. If your angry, go walk, do some sport, or talk with a friend. 

This group is full of people who have a lot of trouble accepting their diagnosis, you should  be more considerate and know when&where to share your opinions. ### OP what that girl did was wrong and don’t listen to anyone else who tells you otherwise. ### I completely understand why you’re upset ### Well, ""normal"" behavior is to just say, ""I want to break up"", and not to try to get the other person to break up first. 

It's also not ""normal"" to make health choices for other people, and that's what she's doing. 

I do hope the relationship is over. You deserve better. ### That’s why more people are getting it. This is ridiculous, knowing that fact that you have it . Tell others before getting intimidated, so that they have a choice. Because of people like these other suffers too. ### Is she a bad person? Hmmm. Well, I’d say that’s down to a lot more than the lack of disclosure—saying “she took care of her body so what does it matter” or whatnot—that is pretty inexcusably selfish. 

And using this as a way to manipulate you into breaking up with her is, without a doubt, cruel and unkind.

RE disclosure—my personal belief is that disclosure is always necessary for informed, enthusiastic consent—and I’m far from the only person who feels this way. 

But I also have genuine compassion for members of this community or anyone with HSV who is afraid to disclose due to the stigma associated with it. Although I think it’s wrong to fail to disclose when one knows one has HSV, I understand where that fear that leads to nondisclosure comes from. 

That said—your partner doesn’t sound afraid of the stigma. She sounds pretty confident and manipulative in her choice of when to disclose and when not to. 

One other thing to note—please get tested again a few months from now—there’s a good chance that you’re not positive for HSV2, but on the off-chance that you’ve only just acquired it, you might not have developed antibodies in time for your most recent test. It’s always good to know your status for sure. 

I’m so sorry your partner handled things the way she did—it’s always quite jarring to meet someone who’s so blatant about their own selfishness and disregard for other people’s sexual wellbeing and right to informed, enthusiastic consent. You deserved better. ###  you should ALWAYS ALWAYS disclose! ### [deleted] ### You're 100% right to be mad. ### Op she should have disclosed but you sound like an immature douchebag. There are lots of reasons why someone might struggle to disclose and being a pathological narcissist is not one of the more common ones. ### Was she korean? ### Let’s look at the good parts!! Thank God you didn’t catch it. That is really awesome. Sleeping with someone for 6 months and no spread to you. Did you wear condoms? Was she taking meds? ### Agreed ### Thank you, I know. I appreciate you ### She can’t stand being “blamed” or taking responsibility for her actions or her words.
I learned the hard way. Narcissistic people are real and I don’t throw the term around loosely but I know I’m right this time around. It’s not healthy behavior and often leaves people hurt and confused. ### Exactly. The fact that she withheld is messed up but also she tried to say that it was my choice to have sex with her and that “it takes 2 to tango”.
Ugh. She didn’t even feel that bad about telling me and was hoping I would just break up with her. What a great human ### That’s what I told her. She acted like it wasn’t a big deal. She is a highly sexual person and I can’t imagine how many other men she had not disclosed this info to. She is also a selfish person who can’t admit she is wrong on many levels. So frustrating because we actually fell in love. I’m so confused ### Wtf you should ALWAYS be disclosing to your partners especially before you out them at risk. Who gives af if a lot of people have it? No one WANTS to get it. It’s our responsibility to give people the chance for informed consent that we did not have. That was incredibly shitty of her ### I was tested and it came back negative for types 1 and 2. She had hsv2 and she knew it.

I realize it sounds like I’m calling her “crazy” or whatever but she has issues and she knows it.
She made the choice to not disclose FOR HER OWN BENEFIT. You are defending the actions of someone who did an incredibly shitty thing to another human being. You sound immature and 
should keep your opinions to yourself. ### She was part Asian but not Korean. Do you know her too lol!? ### Why do you ask? ### What she said is incorrect, in the state I’m from as well as many other states not disclosing is a crime and considered rape. ### You’re kidding me?!?! 
It was your choice to have sex”?!!?? 
Nope throw her in the garbage. Hell maybe set it on fire just a little bit though. ### [deleted] ### [deleted] ### [deleted] ### Trying to see if ex has a pattern of doing this ### She can’t take responsibility for herself for anything. I learned that about her eventually. 
She has narcissistic tendencies and overall personality disorder. She’s in therapy but I don’t think she can change. She’s repeated the same patterns her whole life. She admitted to cheating on all of her ex partners besides one.
She also admitted not disclosing to her sex partners about having hsv2 ### I was tested. Came back negative. Still doesn’t make what she did to me ok. Heartbroken though ### You’re invalidating this persons feelings?? Saying that “oh well too bad, but most of the population has it 🤷🏻‍♀️” no one gets a pass. If she knew about it before they started dating then she should have disclosed it. End of story. ### Why do you guys love throwing stats around like that justifies anything his partner did to him?  Everyone definitely does not have herpes by old age I’m in my 30s and have tested negative for HSV1 and HSV2 numerous times yet you guys like to paint this image that everyone has it to make yourself feel better and justify knowingly putting others at risk just like his partner did to him. Shame on you I hope Karma gets you and others who think like you. ### Why does age even matter? I’m not very young. We broke up but I did continue the relationship for awhile. Turns out she had wanted to break up earlier because she wants to have her freedom to sleep around with whomever she wants and I just didn’t have enough money for her needs. A real quality human being as you can tell ### From my experience I would say she probably does have a pattern of not disclosing and probably doesn’t think it’s a problem. Which I think it is a problem. I’m aware that people have the choice to take the risk of contracting hsv, but it should be their choice. Not disclosing is not giving a person their choice and that is fucked up. ### [deleted] ### [deleted] ### [deleted] ### Don’t lump me in with this motherfucker. You should always always disclose. Just because a lot of the population has it doesn’t mean people should be carelessly spreading it! ### Yeah—I’m here for sharing the stats because they destigmatize those of us living with this virus.

But the stats should actually make us *more* willing to disclose and let partners know—if so many people have it, there is less shame in admitting that we have it too. 

High rates of HSV in the general population are NOT an excuse for not disclosing. ### [deleted] ### Thank you ### You are ### Stop spreading false information 90% of the world does not have herpes. According to the WHO 67% have HSV1 globally and 11% have HSV2 globally. So just because 67% have HSV1 that means the other 33% who don’t have it don’t matter and the other 89% of people who don’t have HSV2 also don’t matter? What his partner did to him is wrong regardless of any stats you present but of course you try to deflect by throwing around stats like that justifies what his partner did to him. ### OP wasn’t asking if his partner was a bad person for having HSV though. 

He was asking if her being flippant about not disclosing her status was the wrong call. And it was. ### Actually younger people usually have it. ### [deleted] ### [deleted] ### The thing that is tricky is that no one get tested. Like the STD panel does not test for herpes unless you specifically ask for it and blood test are not accurate. The 11% are most people who showed symptoms as blood tests can give false negatives...so you will never actually know who has herpes or not as blood tests are inaccurate.  Anyone one who is sexually active or doing oral can get genital herpes. 67% of the world had Oral herpes and a lot pf people have oral sex, do you honestly believe only 11% of people have genital herpes. The stats say 11% for hsv2, hsv-1 can go to genitals from oral sex and 67% of people have that! ### [deleted] ### You’re the type of person that gives people with herpes a bad rep, fuck off ### You are really trying hard to minimize OPs concerns by throwing around stats. Believe whichever source you want to believe on herpes statistics but back to the MAIN POINT of this thread, what OPs partner did to him is wrong and she should have disclosed to him PERIOD. Your stats do not make what she did ok so take them and shove them up your ass. ### I know at least 23 people with Herpes and only 1 is older than me and I’m 27. ### [deleted] ### Yes I’m person, a support group for young people with Herpes.

“risk of transmission from an infected male to an uninfected female partner is higher than the risk of transmission from an infected female to an uninfected male partner.”

“One study examined rates of genital herpes transmission in heterosexual couples when only one partner was initially infected [1]. Over one year, the virus was transmitted to the other partner in 10 percent of couples. In 70 percent of cases, infection occurred at a time when there were no symptoms.

Use of condoms and suppressive antiviral medication can decrease the risk of spreading the infection to partners who are not infected.”

Any insight welcome.",1,2022-03-13 06:43:19-04:00,"Cold sores, and herpes infections in general, generally require direct skin-to-skin contact for there to be any practical risk of transmission. That means a person's mouth or genitals having direct skin-to-skin contact with the infected body part of a person who has it.

Herpes expert Terri Warren, who has a 35+ year career researching and treating herpes specifically, has repeatedly stressed that herpes *cannot* be transmitted via drinking straws, cups, utensils, cigarettes/joints/bongs, shared food items, or inanimate objects in general. Herpes is a very fragile virus that cannot live long outside the body and requires both moisture and warmth to survive. Also, a certain *volume* of virus is required in order to cause an infection. A small trace amount is insufficient. Terri has stated that the only inanimate objects that pose any practical risk of *oral* transmission are lipsticks / chapsticks / lip gloss because the particular properties of these items can sometimes sustain the virus for short periods and they can sometimes be used by another person immediately after someone who might be contagious. Similarly, she has stated that the only inanimate objects that pose any risk for *genital* transmission are shared sex toys that, again, might be used by another person immediately after a person who is infected. She also advises people with genital infections to not share bath towels *when they are having an outbreak*, but expects the risk of transmission in this manner to still be extremely unlikely.

Here is one such quote from Terri on her clinic forum where she addresses the issue and responds to someone asking about potential transmission from sharing a phone:

>the only inanimate objects I am at all concerned about are sex toys and lipsticks. We do advise individuals not to share warm moist towels, but even transmission in this way is extremely unlikely. The phone is not the kind of contact that transmits herpes. There has to be more contact than that. To acquire herpes, there is a certain amount of virus that need to be present and it is not a tiny amount. I guess if a person had a big cold sore and was rubbing their cold sore actively into the phone and then the next person came up immediately afterwards and started putting the phone in their mouth, there might be a 1% chance of transmission. It just doesn’t happen this way.

([Source](https://www.westoverheights.com/forum/question/mouth-outbreaks-and-transmission-through-phone-sharing/))
  
And here's another example where a client wrote:

>Scenario: My friend has large and frequent cold sores. I was visiting her for coffee and when she was making the coffees she licked and sucked the spoon she was using and then used the spoon to scoop the milk froth on top of my coffee (did not stir). She had a healing cold sore (scab had fallen off). I was worried but too polite to say anything, so waited 5 minutes before drinking my coffee trying to avoid the froth.

>The next day I woke up with a sore throat, slight sniffles and light headedness (but I also had a cold/allergies last week). My top lip felt funny but it could have been in my imagination due to being paranoid or just dry. I got Zovirax and put it on just in case.

And Terri replied:

>Someone else on here asked a similar question today but with soup instead of coffee. My answer is the same – a million to one chance that you would contract herpes in this way.

>I don’t know why medical websites say that honestly. There is just no evidence in the scientific literature to say that this is true and I’m totally a science based clinician. Perhaps it is because people go into their providers and say “I ate hot soup that my friend made who gets cold sores and now I have one”. Of course, we can’t extrapolate that because someone who has cold sores did something and now you have one, you got it from them. The only inanimate object that I worry about for transmission of oral herpes is sharing lipsticks. Lipsticks and lip gloss stay moist and if someone with active oral virus uses lipstick immediately before someone else, that is a possibility for transmission. That’s why cosmetic counters no longer allow testing with the actual lipstick and now use surrogates, like q tips.

My mouth was too swollen to really get a good look except for the ones on my tongue. They mouth ones were almost cankersore in size but in places I had never had a cankersore.  The tongue ones I had three all on one side of the tongue going down the tongue and one on the tip. They were red and fairly decent sized and those hurt more. The sores actually on my gums were the more painful of the sores. Brushing my teeth always led to a mouth full of blood.   My mouth took about a week, maybe a little over a week to go back to normal.

For this moment i am on Daily Valtrex (Already two month, a little more) and SADBE ### I have just recently been visually diagnosed by an ER Dr and my general practitioner who wants to do blood work at the first week of April. I’ve done a pretty extensive amount if research in the sleepless nights that I’ve had since then and Valtrex is definitely a suppressant and should be taken daily. Obviously with any sort of medication it can be a bit harsh on the liver  especially for those that have previous liver issues. 

I have a family friend I was talking to who has had HSV1 since middle school. (15+ years) She takes her valtrex daily along with L-Lysine, Zinc and her daily ‘one a day’ type vitamin supplement when she has breakfast, she eat healthier since there’s quite a bit of food groups out there that have given others OBs, works out 2-3 times a week and drinks a ton of water daily to help the liver filtrate. She hasn’t had an OB in over 6 years and I have read that the longer you have the virus the OBs get milder and milder as time goes on. Your body builds up the proteins, white blood cells and antibodies and definitely does a good job at fighting back against the virus. 

If I get tested positive for HSV in a few weeks I am 100% going to go the Valtrex route and do something similar to what she does. I have some links in this post I shared with someone a few days ago. Go check it out if you want to, I’ve also been cutting out some of the food groups listed in those links and so far I’ve only had my one OB. https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/t9638r/ohvs1_advice/hzt1lsk/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3 ### My question is has anyone stopped taking valtrex as a daily suppressant and the OB came back immediately?

tctdyo,"First Outbreak Well I am in the lovely throws of my first outbreak. I am devastated to say the least. I know it’s treatable and all but I already seriously lacked sexual confidence as it was to begin with. 

Anyways: I’ve been sick for a month and a half with a sore throat. The sore throat started a month an a half ago but I didn’t have swollen tonsils or anything. I just has swollen glands in my neck. I got a fever for a day but was over it quick. Then a month & half went by where the sore throat came and went where long story short I saw the dr 4 times and they couldn’t figure out what gave me the sore throat and swollen glands bc they tested for everything. Well fast forward to this weekend.. had sex with a FWB on Sunday then started to develop aches and fatigue Mon-Tuesday Wednesday got a fever that still hasn’t gone away and that night I thought I might also be developing a yeast infection in addition to being sick. Tried treating that via OTC cream but the swelling got worse & more painful. fast forward to today (Saturday) I woke up and when I went pee it burned horribly! So I thought I better have a look down there so I grabbed a hand help mirror and sure enough I had a bunch of open blisters. Already went to urgent care today and got diagnosed just by the doctor looking at them. (They did swab too but that will take a bit to come back) 

My questions are:

1. Has me being sick for the past month & a half been due to this?

2. When do you disclose when dating? I have been single for some time and have been dating recently so I feel a big sense of doom when it comes to my future of dating

3. Will I ever be able to have sex unprotected again with someone I’ve disclosed to? TBH I hate condoms

4. What are the chances of me never having an outbreak again without having to take the antiviral? Does that happen? 

5. When will this stupid fever and body aches go away if I started meds today? 

(My dr was not very helpful as I went to urgent care and he was very rushed)",2,2022-03-12 18:11:42-05:00,"Take a break from dating for a bit and let youe body heal and figure itself out. Figure out if you need to take meds everyday or not. I got lucky and had one initial breakout and haven't had one since..that was 7 years ago. I do not take any sort of antiviral. I have sex unprotected because I have no symptoms whatsoever and my partner and previous partners have trusted me enough that it didn't matter to them what sort of diagnosis I had. 

So I took an antiviral initially to make my first breakout go away but after that I did not have any breakouts again. I'm not sure how common this is with ghsv1 but my doctor told me that it would probably never come back because it's not the aggressive type of hsv. She also told me that I don't have to disclose to people but I still tell them and if they shame me then I know their not right for me, so it's a bit of a test at this point. Your body aches and pains should go away about a month and a half after you take your first pill, if I remember correctly from my experience. 

Just remember, this isn't end all be all. You can still have a very normal sex life and you are not dumb or gross for contracting hsv. So important to remember. ### 1. Has me being sick for the past month & a half been due to this? 
There’s a good chance it may be due to herpes I had a 2 week long flu the weeks before my outbreak and then the stress of the actual outbreak had me feeling like crap for additional weeks but it was probably psychosomatic.

2. When do you disclose when dating? I have been single for some time and have been dating recently so I feel a big sense of doom when it comes to my future of dating
I have had the most luck disclosing around the 3rd date when perusing a relationship. Gives you time to get out if the person is a tool bag in general. If you are looking for a hook up I would disclose 24 hours before. I have become a hoe after herpes (I’ve disclosed over 25 times with a pretty high success rate.

3. Will I ever be able to have sex unprotected again with someone I've disclosed to? TBH I hate condoms. 
That is completely up to you and your partners comfort level. Condoms are only around 87% effective in protecting against herpes and if you’re on antivirals with no outbreaks tranmission is at like 1% most of the people I’ve been with have not used a condom (I disclose every time) and I have (know on wood) never to my knowledge passed it to anyone.

4. What are the chances of me never having an outbreak again without having to take the antiviral? Does that happen?
So you didn’t mention if you have hsv-1 or 2 but with antivirals over time there is a good chance I’m to have little to no outbreaks going foward. I have ghsv-1 and have gone 5 years with no outbreaks. There are other treatments to help you prevent / shorten your outbreaks

5. When will this stupid fever and body aches go away if I started meds today?
Prob doesn’t work that fast but the body aches went away for me with epsome salt baths. And taking Advil 


I’ll attach info on a support group and a list of social media accounts that maybe can give you more advice and information! If you need anything g feel free to dm me!!

This is a list of social Medias about herpes. Sometimes it does people good to see people being public about it and the amount of support they receive from strangers. The accounts are funny and informative and all herpes positive. There is everything on there from podcasts, YouTube, TikToks, blogs, Facebook support groups, Instagram pages, dating pages, subreddits, and websites.

HSV2 doesn't like the oral area. ### Is there anyway to know the exact type? I never was diagnosed with which type. ### The type is on your lab work if blood or a culture was taken. ### You can get a blood test if you've been infected for a while ### Ok I’ll check it out.

tcfqxk,"Do i tell ex’s new girl he has HSV2? He will not disclose/is in denial that he has it. My ex is talking to someone new, not sure for how long but at least a week (we have only been broken up for two). He is in complete denial about having genital herpes and will not disclose. He didn’t disclose to me, and has acted surprised and angry the few times I have mentioned him giving it to me. Do I tell her, or just let her either get it or not get it?
The main thing stopping me is that I don’t want it to get back to him that I “sabotaged” him as I did not want to burn the bridge, and his mental health is kind of explosive which makes me worry that if this girl messages him, asking if he has herpes or citing herpes as the reason she doesn’t want to talk to him anymore, he may harm himself, or lie to her and take it out on me (i am still living here and have no place to go for the time being. He has never been violent towards me in the past, but like I said, his mental health isn’t awesome).
I know we can’t control others. If I knew 100% she would trust me and make up her own excuse to stop talking to him, I would do it in a heartbeat. I am anxious about the repercussions.",44,2022-03-12 07:50:03-05:00,"its illegal in certain states to not disclose after STD diagnosis. I would definitely tell her, idk why comments are saying stay out of it bc it’s always a person’s right to know what they’re being exposed to. ### I would tell her. He sounds like an absolute monster. I wish my ex’s ex would’ve told me. ### My ex denied that he had it and ended up giving it to me because he lied over and over again and cheated so many times. I would disclose, new girl should have the opportunity to opt out of something that will change her life forever, i wish i did. ### I would leave it alone. ### Unless you have only had 1 partner I don't think you can definitively say he is the source. The infection can be dormant for a long time and sexual contact is not the only way it can be transmitted. It also is not your place to ensure how or to whom he chooses to disclose. ### Personally if you know he has it and won’t disclose maybe approach him first. I was given hsv2 by a guy who purposely doesn’t disclose to women. I only found out because his ex messaged me informing me. Although this case is a literal different because he was known around town for doing this since 2017. ### Hell yeah I would tell her! I wish someone told me! My ex went on to give it to 4 other women. I got to a 5th before he could infect her. ### In all honesty, it sounds like you might not be fully over your ex (and that’s okay!) and hey, maybe you are. Im just a stranger on the internet and that’s how it reads to me. My ex didn’t disclose to me either, and it drove me insane. Since we broke up, he’s dated 3-4 girls within a year. All of them are somehow “crazy” or ghosted him. It pains me to think that he did the same shit to all these girls, but I can’t control it. It’s up to the person, and them alone, to disclose. If you start messaging every girl he starts talking to, he can easily twist it and you look like the bad guy. I’d personally just mind your own business, but that’s just me. ### It not your place to disclose for somebody else ### Yes. I don't care if it ""breaches his privacy"". He's putting other people in a situation that they don't know they could be in. ### I’m kind of surprised with the amount of people who are saying it’s not your place. I’m unsure of what the laws are like where they live, but here it’s tantamount to assault. 

It may not be your responsibility, but him knowingly not disclosing is removing them of their agency which is extremely fucked up and I think you’re well within your rights to have that conversation. 

To say it’s not your place to make someone aware of another knowingly trying to rob them of their agency that may result in long term physical and mental harm and disruption to their health and is in many places literally illegal seems like an objectively shit take. It would be different if he agreed to get tested or didn’t act in this current fashion, but it isn’t so I think having a quiet word with her do it doesn’t blow back on you would be the right and kind thing to do. ### please do

this shit lasts for life and is like a nuke towards your mental health

your body doesn't feel like it's yours anymore, and herpes is 10x worse when it affects women

if someone had told me that the person I was with had herpes I would have ran for the hills and thanked them with everything I got

she has the right to know what she's getting into and doesn't deserve to have her life drastically changed by some dirtbag who doesn't disclose ### I honestly would want to know so I would tell. I had a kinda similar situation in October where the guy was blaming me and the girl he cheated on me with for the std. I got her number and let her know. According him, he had her believing it was really her. Even though she tested negative before him. I tested negative while with him. And he finally confessed to me there was a third woman. So I told and I didn’t care about the fall out because you’re endangering people at this point. ### I was the new girl. I was dating new guy for a couple months. We got intimate. Then I got a friend request on fb from his ex gf. I questioned him as to why she’d do that. He said she was an alcoholic and was probably checking me out and accidentally hit the request in her stupor. Then she sent me a message apologizing but telling me he wasn’t being honest. So I asked him what she was referring to. He then said he’d actually been married 4 times not twice. He also has had genital herpes for years. He said his sores aren’t always on his penis and so not protected by a condom. That I should feel privileged that he’s telling me because he only tells the women he likes. I ended it not because he has the virus, but because of the lying. ### I wouldn't not your place. & you're the ex so it won't come off as you're doing it with good intentions she just may think you're not over him and want him back so you're trying to break them up it's between them to have that sexual health conversation just my opinion ### So...I can kinda relate. I tried to tell my ex's new girl what kind of person he is, a lying, manipulating, womanizer. It fell on deaf ears. He is the one who gave me herpes. I tried to tell her that too.
I don't regret telling her because I know this, you can't control how someone will take what your saying. I needed to put it out there that this was the kind of person he is. She claims she won a prize. Lmao...I didn't do it out of spite but to warn her with good intentions. 
If it's on your heart to tell her because it's the ""right"" thing to do. Then go with it. After that it's not in your hands. ### I’m in the same dilemma, I just chose to stay out of it. I feel I did my part by urging him to get tested and letting him know I believe he gave me HSV2. ### Stay out of it! ### You still live with him? This is really messy and you’re not responsible for his sex life with other people. ### Yes, she needs to know. ### [deleted] ### Personally, put yourself first. You are not responsible for other's sexual health. If you are sexually active it is your responsability to get checked out before and after having sex with a new partner! ### Definitely not your place. You assume the risk of contracting anything/everything when you have sex with someone, just as you assume the risk of getting pregnant every time you have sex. And honestly, it’s just as likely that she has it and hasn’t told him 😂 ### Absolutely not, its none of your business. They’re gonna continue to navigate through their relationship between the two of them on other matters than this, and also you said he won’t disclose, but do you know that for 100% fact? You’re having an anxious response to this and you need to settle your feeling of needing to insert yourself into your exes new relationship ### Yea you can ask her if they discussed herpes, HIV, gonorrhea etc. and who has what. If she says yea then they covered everything then fall back. Most people who contract it without the person telling them wished an ex told them before they laid with said person. 
I believe that's how most people get it. The other party knows and is willingly not telling the other person. Then they play the ""it was dormant all these years"". Naw miss me with that. You know you have it and ignored it. Same with obesity. Like some people have a glandular problem but most people just can't stop eating. Same  with herpes some its dormant most know they got it and not disclosing it. That's just my opinion ### Not your place. ### my vote is stay out of it. are you going to disclose every thing about him you would “want to know” about dating someone new you’re seeing? this isn’t any different. both parties need to get tested before becoming active with any sexual partners, and even still you’re both running the risk of contracting STDs. herpes frequently isn’t included on std screenings, and false negatives are common; so anyone sexually active even orally is running the risk of contracting. ### I could have written this exact same status
Except I wasn't living with him 
My Dr said given the timeline of when I had my 1st outbreak it was undeniably him
Also the one where i was confirmed he had been my only lover for 6 months previously so had been exposed regardless.
Also he had chafing on his 🍆 at one point which can be all it shows as in men. He denied it was him. Got angry. Said he was clean (he never had a test for herpes) and was already in a new relationship. He's blocked me on Facebook and got his friend circle to delete or block me too. He's so scared if I find out the identity of his new partner (that he was already having unprotected sex with when I got my diagnosis) that I will tell her.
But u know what.  I know if he ever gets caught He's going to just say he caught it off me or deny knowing  Or blame one of her Xs.. He's absolutely gutless and a liar. And this is how it spreads to poor innocent people.
Makes me so angry....! ### If he doesn’t tell whoever he is sleeping with he is just trash.. BUT it is also not your place to do it.. you should stay out of it and move on with your life.. I got hsv2 in the worst possible way and I always disclose so I get the frustration but you need to stay out of it especially if your still living with him.. unfortunately getting an std is a risk everyone takes when they have sex. ### After he refused to get tested, I told my previous partners who all came back negative. I know blood tests can be inaccurate, however I am quite certain it was him. ### I’m not over him, that is true. I really wish someone had reached out to me so I could have decided for myself or somehow been more careful. This is the only girl I’d be able to reach out to, as I only know she exists bc her text came up on his phone next to me. I understand the POV where I ought to mind my own business. I also understand the POV where if I can help one person from being misled like this, it may be morally right to. I dunno. I appreciate your feedback! ### Genuine question: why is having herpes such a detriment to your mental health? I was just diagnosed, yet I haven’t let it bother me. My reasoning being it’s just a cold sore and everybody has cold sores. It’s also something I can’t control, so what’s the fuss all about? I guess I could understand if you’re having frequent and extremely painful outbreaks but so far that is not the case for me. Some insight would be appreciated bc this is all new to me. ### You dodged a bullet. He never would have told u if she hadn't made contact! ### Unfortunately I’ve asked him to get tested 6 times and he just won’t. I’ve been as calm and collected about it as possible towards him, given him no reason to believe results would be followed by confrontation etc. Every time I have tried talking to him about it, he gets very quiet, uneasy, angry so to avoid problems I don’t push as hard as I should. ### It is fact that he will not disclose. He did not disclose to me. Over the past year I have brought it up multiple times, yet he will not talk about it with me, when I bring it up he pretends we have never talked about it before and it’s new info to him. Either shuts down or acts disgusted. It’s 50-50 which reaction I’ll get. In a previous comment I said my previous partners got tested so I could be sure it was from him. He will deny having anything even if asked. ### Although my ex assured me he had no STDs, me contracting herpes was still a little bit my fault. I had been tested and assumed his response meant he also had been. But from now on I will not sleep with anyone without seeing the results myself. Her sexual health has really nothing to do with you. I get how you can feel morally conflicted, but at the end of the day it’s up to the two people having sex to be safe about it. Herpes is super common, chances are this girl has already been exposed to it anyway. The way your post and replies are worded sound like you want this girl to not date him because of herpes, and that isn’t fair to him or anyone else on this sub. ### because for some of us, our brains are wired differently in general. the stigma in itself can be detrimental to people who are already depressed or anxious in general such as myself. an actual outbreak or constant outbreaks can be detrimental to people. i can 100000% tell you my diagnosis just made my mental health even worse. every time i get an outbreak it’s always me in my head. so no, maybe it’s not detrimental to everyone’s mental health, but to a LOT of people it is.

edit:
i’ve gotten help and counseling and such, but some people it takes a while to figure out what they need to do personally. i’ve accepted that i have hsv and it’s not the worst thing that could’ve happened to me, but that doesn’t mean i don’t get sad and get reminded of how i got it, which was a traumatic event, when i have outbreaks. it’s not like that for everyone for sure and it definitely should be destigmatized, but some people aren’t educated on it enough to know that ### Before 2018, I didn't have cold sores so no not everyone has it. Everyone copes with the diagnosis differently and when you are treated like a leper because of the virus and the stigma associated with hsv; it can most certainly impact mental health. Good for you for not letting it get to you. Not everyone is built like that especially if you use to be the one laughing at Herpes jokes! ### detriment maybe because 1 nobody wants it, 2 there's a stigma against it, 3 and nobody sane wants to pass it to someone they love and make them go through the same thing

it lasts for life ### I can totally relate to this. I’ve been very careful and cautious about my sexual health I’ve asked for proof and refused to have sex if there was. The day we had sex i asked to see the proof he claims he left it at home but assured me he was all clear.. we did it with a condom on (only last 2 minutes) & the condom had a whole in it somehow. Now I’m pretty sure i have genital herpes.. or some sort of STI. since I’ve gotten tested too soon n have to wait 12 weeks I’ve been begging him to get tested & he literally refuses and acts uneasy. I’ve never seen a man who “knows” they have nothing act like this.. later on he admits to never getting testing but he never had symptoms so he claims it’s not from him. But I’m 100% certain it is since I’ve tested negative before him n haven’t had partners. Now i look at it all his exes are “blocked & crazy” but I’m like hmm are they blocked cuz of the same reason? It’s just sick & I really wish this never happened. 2 minutes changed my whole life ### Tbh it’s still none of your concern id stay in your lane ### I do accept my role in contracting herpes; in hindsight I wish I had asked for proof of testing rather than him saying he had been, and will be doing so with future partners. I have learned a lot in the past year since being diagnosed. Knowing what I know now, I still would have had sex with him, but definitely wouldn’t have trusted that his slight razor burn was that. Which is my fault and I feel stupid, but enforces my feeling that knowledge is power. I very much am a ‘treat others how you’d want to be treated’ person and like I said, I wish I’d been told by anyone so I could be aware and careful, and wanted other points of view on this before i potentially said something I couldn’t take back. ### ",17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tcfqxk/do_i_tell_exs_new_girl_he_has_hsv2_he_will_not/

tcqxog,"Looking for Clinical Research and Studies regarding a couple of somewhat Niche Questions 
Hello fellow unwitting hosts of r/Herpes,

I’ve evidently contracted gHSV2 sometime in the last ten or so days, with my first symptoms presenting on Tuesday.

I have spent easily 8 hours a day since then voraciously scouring Google Scholar, Arxiv and abusing the godsend that is SciHub.

I’ve read easily 50 papers by now.. no joke. Everything from the heavily cited classics to the cutting edge of vaccine research with gene therapies.

And yet… my somewhat unique (even “rare” apparently based on the data) circumstances leave me with many unanswered questions.  Despite exhausting my skills with search operators, excluding terms, using AND/OR statements, the whole nine yards… I haven’t been able to find a shred of research pertaining to what would seem to me as fairly obvious research questions that some PostDoc would’ve looked into somewhere at sometime… but hell, at this point I’d be happy even with just some relevant case studies!

Quick background:

- Girlfriend has **orofacial** HSV-2.  She contracted it ~2.5 years ago, hadn’t had an outbreak in a year, and this is now her 5th outbreak.  All recurrences have been exclusively on her face along trigeminal nerve - never any symptoms present on genitalia.

- We last had sex on Sunday.  She hadn’t given me oral since Friday, though we had penetrative vaginal sex over weekend.

- Tuesday morning she tells me she feels outbreak starting.  Tuesday evening I begin to experience subtle sensation on my own genitalia.  However, physical sensations of discomfort had mostly ceased by the time I went to sleep, so I chalked it up to psychosomatic phenomena.  We are assuming her outbreak was caused by beginning an SSRI medication two weeks prior, and that she had been significantly shedding prior to her first symptoms as a result.

- Wednesday midmorning I notice unmistakable physical presentation of HSV-2 on my own genitalia (male).  Surprising because there was almost zero physical sensations by this point.  However, I had already studied up plenty well to recognize what I was looking at.  Physical presentation was mild but anticipated it getting worse.

- It’s now been 72 hours since my clinical GH symptoms appeared.  No significant changes since first noticing.  No spreading, same number of blisters in the same places.  No physical discomfort or sensations of note.


So, now for the questions I’ve had zero luck finding answers too among the bio and medical literature.  I’m not sure if I’m using improper terminology, or if oral HSV-2 is rare enough that questions like mine don’t generally merit study. 

**Questions**

1.  Due to our respective anatomical regions effected, I’m not even sure if we’re technically concordant or discordant.  Regardless, seeing as I am effected genitally and she is effected on the mandible, do I now pose a significant risk of giving her a secondary (?) HSV2 infection of the same strain on her genitals?  Is there any evidence that one host can harbor the virus in two disparate nerve branches?  Or is there evidence that her immune system (she’s immunocompetent, young and healthy) shouldn’t have any problems fending off the same virus in other “new” locations of her body?

2.  As a concordant couple (assuming that is our appropriate classification), is there any research data available indicating whether me being exposed to her asymptomatic shedding episodes going forward would be a possible (or likely ?) trigger of recurrences for me?  I know oral HSV-2 typically sheds the least viral load of any other combination, as well as results in the most infrequent recurrences, but don’t know what to make of this aspect.

3. On the other hand, myself now with (perhaps mildly symptomatic gHSV2? Too soon to tell but cautiously optimistic) gHSV2, and being a male, I am statistically going to have frequent recurrences with shedding of both the physically symptomatic variety as well as asymptomatic.  Is it a significant concern that my shedding will be a trigger causing more recurrent episodes for her potentially? 

4. This last one is least critical, but still something I’ve had in my mind as a curious detail.  As I noted, the last time she had given me oral was several full days prior to her first symptoms, and even then it was very brief before we moved on to penetrative sex.  I’m aware it’s perfectly possible that saliva-to-penis contact (however brief it was) could have been the moment of contraction.  However, is oral to oral transfer possible in such a way that I would express the infection genitally?  On the same theme, does someone with oral HSV2 shed virus through vaginal fluid?


I don’t expect that these topics will have been explored in a particularly rigorous fashion as the more impactful questions receive, but I’m thinking maybe some of you folks might be able to point me to publications that have directly or indirectly touched on these questions.

I’m also not against hearing the anecdotal evidence of “lore” from the community.  Obviously that sort of information will be taken with many grains of salt, but it’s common enough that first hand experience offers meaningful insights that sometimes do get explained in the formal research later… I’ll at least take notes let’s say.  

But obviously, links to scholastic articles are what’s ideal.

You’re also welcome to suggest me search terms or just particular databases!  I’ve got my clinical terminology fairly in order at this point, but perhaps I am missing a key descriptor that would suddenly reveal exactly what I’m looking for?

Truly anything that might lead me to what I’m looking for would be much appreciated.

Thank you in advance and I hope to be able to contribute here and engage with y’all in the coming years.",1,2022-03-12 16:09:25-05:00,"Did you actually get swabbed to confirm the ghsv2 diagnosis ?

If your gf has given you ghsv2 and she has had ohsv2 ( which is possible but rare i’ve read ) for several years then it is highly unlikely for you to infect another area if her body. Until your antibody level is well established ie several months it’s possible to auto inoculate but hsv2 generally prefers the genital area. 

And your future shedding or her her future shedding does not impact or bring on an OB in the other person.  But some people do find rough sex or friction may bring on OB. 

The areas that shed are the infected areas. So if you have it genitally you shed from the boxer short area. and same with oral hsv , it lies dormant in the nerves in facial region and will shed from the skin in that nerve area .  

It’s skin to skin transmission , so body fluids may contain some of the virus but viral load in fluids generally not considered the main route of transmission as a sufficient viral load is needed to transmit. And transmission can occur without fluid presence , skin contact is needed.

I remember when I was first diagnosed with herpes, it felt like my world was over. It was over as I knew it. 
I survived cancer, childhood trauma & abuse, depression-anxiety and herpes all within 24-years-old. So yeah, you could say I felt like it was the last straw. That my life was always meant to be doomed. But what I failed to realize or even understand at the time of my herpes diagnosis is even though my world was forever changed as I knew it, it wasn’t the first time it was changed and it won’t be the last time. And despite that fact, I’ve survived all of it. So now I can come to you and say I know I will survive this diagnosis too. 

And so will you. 

Even if it doesn’t feel like it just yet. I’ve been where you’ve been. Sitting with it. It festering to the point you just cry. You feel hallow. You feel alone. You feel like you’ll never find love. But it’s all a lie society has told people who get this type of diagnosis. The truth is we are still us. We will still find love. We will be ok. 

I don’t know what stage of this diagnosis you’re at but wherever you are, please know those dark feelings do not have to last forever. You don’t have to let this consume you. That anger you feel towards the person who gave it to you doesn’t have to rule you. We can choose to fight for ourselves. We can hope for a cure, but until then love yourself anyways.

To make things worse I have a date tonight that was supposed to happen last weekend but was he had to reschedule to this weekend. I’m tempted to just cancel & stay home.

don't let outbreaks define who you are and what you want to do.

Womp womp! ### You didn't say what kind of herpes you have or whether you take medication for it. But one thing you could do in future to cover your bases in situations like this is temporarily go on daily suppressive medication in advance of your scheduled date. That would very substantially lower the chances of you experiencing an outbreak during that period.

Note that daily suppressive medication requires 5 days of continued use to reach maximum effectiveness.

Ideally, you'd probably want to start it say around 10-14 days before your scheduled visit because you wouldn't want to experience an outbreak in the week prior to your date either, in case it might still be present when your date occurs.

Then, you can stop taking the medication afterward if you wish. ### ",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tcerw9/what_a_bummer/

That’s the most accurate test for herpes other than the western blot. ### Not a doctor, but from my understanding of herpes, a culture of an active outbreak is the most reliable.

A blood test coming up negative just means that whatever antibodies you do have were too low for the test to detect them, thus it coming out negative.

It does not mean you were ""cured."" It does not mean you do not have it. It just means the blood test could not detect high enough levels of antibodies.

Even cultures, though far superior to blood tests, can come up with false negatives. My first outbreak, I had two cultures done five days apart. My first was positive. My second was negative. 

I would trust your positive culture. I would dismiss the blood test as a false negative. ### Please share what are you taking!? I’m having issues with antivirus too. ### are you on daily antivirals since the day you were diagnosed? ### I’m not asking if I don’t have herpes I’ve had it for a year I know I do I just don’t know what a negative blood test means like does it mean my medicine is working ### I’m not asking if I’m cured I just was wondering if it meant my medicine was working, I know I have herpes ### Famciclovir and simpesse ### Yes 2x a day plus vitamins and immune support gummies ### The IgG has a high false negative rate—it likely doesn’t mean anything about the medication you’re on—which doesn’t affect antibodies in any way. It’s just the nature of the IgG to produce a lot of false negatives. ### I mostly put the cured bit in there for anyone else who might be lurking and reading so they don't misconstrue what actually happened in this situation. 

In regards to your medicine, yes, it seems the antivirals are doing their job to suppress. It's also just been some time since you were diagnosed initially. First year is always the worst year. Most people, their body gets more accustomed to having it as the years go on.

I am lucky in that I only have to take medication during an outbreak, and it's been four? five?  years since my last outbreak.

Edit: Definitely more than five years. I met my husband four years ago and I haven't had an outbreak since before we met. ### Can I reach you in private? I want ask you, did you took valtrex?

Be careful of the words you choose and the messages you tell yourself. I mean, Ukraine isn't even ""destroyed"" yet, and they are still fighting, right?

You are sad, not ""destroyed"".

And you don't even have herpes, right? The girl you've hooked up with has ohsv1. This is quite a leap to ""destroyed"".  67% of people under 50 globally have hsv1 and if you limit yourself to the 33% that don't - and cut that down to just the females if that's the only gender you date - and in your age range - you are really seriously limiting yourself.

You are not ""destroyed"", though. Stop saying that.

Please think of the impact of your words, on yourself and others. ### I’m so sorry it offended you 🙏 ### Okay, sorry for trying to make people a bit less depressed. If herpes bothers you every single day it’s not just herpes, you need to check for parasites, digestive, endocrine system and full immune analysis ### Sorry if you feel bad right now. I do feel bad sometimes myself, but mostly because people on the internet are depressing. The situation itself is not very pleasant, but it gets insane for me when I see some dooming people who seem to like being doomed.

She told you that she had ohsv1. She didn't ""drop it on you"". She told you, presumably before you had any risk, right? What she did was give you the information you needed to make an informed decision. Thank her for it.

The risk isn't ""crazy"". There is risk, but it's certainly far from guaranteed. You know that your hsv1 IgG misses 30% of infections, right? In theory, you could have it and not know it.

Even if you don't, she isn't infectious 24/7. Outside of outbreaks, she is shedding about 25% of days. If she took an antiviral daily, it would cut that to about 12-13%.

When someone sheds, they aren't shedding for 24 hrs, either. It's just part of that day. She isn't a walking, talking herpes infection.

After that relationship ended, for reasons that had nothing to do with herpes, I've only been turned down once, and he had a serious, serious germ-phobia. He had a hard time sitting in the restaurant where other people had used the forks, even though they were clean. I felt bad for him - his life was obviously harder than mine. 

I've had at least 4, maybe 5 others tell me they had it, too. (I'm older, maybe, than you are - I got it in my 30s.) I've tried to use it to sort of repel guys in bars that wouldn't leave me alone, like ""omg, you don't want me, I have herpes"", and they say, ""omg so do I!"" and then they drunkenly think we're some kind of herpes soulmates and cling harder. 🙄

I haven't slept with everyone I've told - not nearly. I just like to get it out of the way. I take valtrex daily, mostly for me, because without it I get frequent outbreaks. I'm currently single, by choice, for reasons again that have nothing to do with herpes, and I haven't transmitted it.

I'm not super attractive - I'm a middle aged woman who could stand to lose some weight, but mostly I don't care what people think. Like me or not - don't care. 

It's just a minor blip in my life. ### It's well known and proven.

It can last several hours, or a short time. Obviously, we don't know when that happens, or how long it's happening - we can't tell unless we're doing lab studies or something. It's asymptomatic. ### Do you watch 90 Day Fiance? You should. 

You are 24. Why would you be telling your parents you got herpes, and why would they be shaming you? You're a fully grown man.

And omg, take a breath. 90% of people who have oral hsv1 never even get symptoms. Ghsv1 outbreaks average 1 a year, and many only get one initial outbreak and never get another. 

And going blind? What? Yes, herpes can cause infections in your eye, and yes, it's super serious when it happens, but we can cure that now, long before you go blind. It's also rare to get ocular herpes. If you did, you wouldn't miss it. It's not like you'd wake up one morning unable to see. You'd have symptoms that would take you to the eye doctor much sooner. 

For reasons that have nothing to do with herpes, and everything to do with me being older and cynical, watching 90 Day Fiance, and seeing people using others for money and citizenship (not everyone - don't anyone come at me), how much do you know about this woman? Have you been giving her money? That's not a discussion for this forum, but something for you to think about yourself. 

So take a deep breath, and think about it all. You have a week. Take herpes out of it - is this someone you think you could be with, realistically? If she were in NY, would you take the risk? Just things to think about. And you might get there and decide you don't really like her and just have a fabulous vacation instead. :) ### You won't spread it to your family. 

Oral herpes is spread by kissing on the mouth. Just kiss them on the cheek. 

You can also transmit oral herpes type 1 to the genitals with oral sex. 

Genital herpes is rarely transmitted outside of having an outbreak, and that is only transmitted by unclothed, genital to genital contact, like penis in vagina sex, or penis in anus sex. It can also spread with heavy, unclothed genital to genital or genital to anal grinding or rubbing. You don't do that with your family. 

Herpes is not spread through objects or sharing a household. A lot of people think you can spread it by sharing drinks, utensils, etc., but it's not an efficient way to do so. It's the age of covid, flus, and all kinds of things, though, that you can transmit that way, so you shouldn't share your stuff. 

If you don't know what she has, ask her. You have a right to know that info. Gently ask her for clarification. 

So many things are linked to dementia. Right now, there is a correlation with hsv1 and dementia, not a causation. It's hard to know for sure without more research because so many people have hsv1, and so many have dementia. Is it a coincidence or a cause? We don't know yet. 

There are also some people who think your phone causes brain cancer. You can't panic over every single thing you hear. You'll never leave your house again. ### You're awesome 👍👍 The herpes soulmates thing is hilarious! But also a really good example of what it's like for people. You could well be the first person those guys have met thats so open and real about it in their world of worry! ### Thenk you for your advice, trust me I can take it lol rewlly thank you I put my worries out there I like to hear advice from other people thank you ### I’m really confused why someone would tell their parents they got herpes. ### No money, that’s why I’m kinda making it a big deal because it’s could of just been get nothing if it don’t work out ### My mom has oral herpes and had misinformation that freaked me out. Like panicking when I took a swig from her coke can while she had an outbreak but it had been sitting on the counter for ten minutes. 

I’m pretty sure she had it orally all my life and the only one who got it was my step dad since they were romantically kissing. 

It’d be super rare to get by sharing drinks or utensils. I really don’t know how you would put family members at risk at all if you have it on your genitals. ### Thanks. 😊

The first time a guy told me he also had it, I was shocked. Now I'm not, and will just be surprised when it finally works to repel the drunken fool. Maybe one day. 🙏😂 ### Uhhh if I get sores on my face lmaoooooo ### And I shaved insurance with my business I run with my family if I get it on my penis ### Why would your mother tell you she gave your step dad oral herpes ? ### She didn’t tell me.

Or tell me what helped them cope with h2. My doctor looked at blisters and instantly told me what it was. I knew it myself I had all the symptoms. Now im waiting on blood work to come back.

Were you not also swab tested?

If visible symptoms are present then the priority should always be swab testing over blood testing. This is *especially* true if there's any possibility the symptoms could be hsv1. Blood testing can be done as *well*, but the priority should be swabbing. This is for several reasons:

1. A blood test cannot detect a brand new herpes infection. Blood tests work by detecting herpes antibodies, which the body starts creating after becoming infected. But it can take anywhere from several weeks to several months before a person will have generated a sufficient volume of antibodies to be detectable on a blood test. This is discussed on our wiki page on herpes testing: [LINK](https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/wiki/herpes_testing). Meanwhile, if visible symptoms are present then they can be swab tested immediately -- there is no waiting period.

2. A blood test cannot specify the location of a herpes infection, or confirm that specific symptoms are herpes. This is especially problematic in cases where people experience ambiguous genital symptoms -- because more than half the population has oral hsv1 (and a full 70% of these people don't know they have it) and so these people will test positive for hsv1 even if it has nothing to do with their genital symptoms. These people may mistakenly conclude that their positive blood test results means that their genital symptoms are hsv1 when they aren't, and when they may not have a genital herpes infection at all. Meanwhile, a swab test will test the specific location that was swabbed.

3. Standard IgG blood tests aren't that good at detecting hsv1 in general. Even after the 12 week waiting period they still miss a full 30% of hsv1 infections. Fortunately, they are better at detecting hsv2 and will only miss 8% of hsv2 infections at 12 weeks and beyond.

Note that there are two different kinds of swab tests available for herpes testing: viral culture and PCR. PCR is newer and is *much* more sensitive than viral culture. Viral culture can be fine when symptoms are pronounced, and in blister like form, or the sort of classic cold-sore-type blister that herpes is known for, and especially if liquid can be readily extracted from the blister/lesion/ulcer. But when symptoms are less pronounced, or not in obvious blister form, then PCR is the way to go if at all possible.

Note also that PCR swabs are less widely available than viral culture swabs. So if you want to get a PCR swab done then call your doctor in advance and ask whether they offer them. If they don't then try calling some other local providers. (and if a provider that you call doesn't offer them, ask the provider if they're aware of any other local providers that *do*, etc).

So, if you haven't been swab tested and still have symptoms then I would strongly encourage you to go and get swab tested.

You also didn't say whether you've been taking any herpes medication. If you are, stop taking it immediately until after getting swab tested, and you can resume taking it afterward. Herpes medication can interfere with herpes testing. ### Hey I understand the depression I was depressed for years until I finally decided enough was enough. I have been diagnosed for 10 years and have had  20+ partners since diagnosis. None of them to their knowledge have genital herpes some had cold sores. I am currently with a guy who is completely HSV negative he works at a blood lab and took a test just for shits and giggles.  He knows about my herpes I disclosed and he is completely fine with it and accepts the risks. There are plenty of people like this who do not care. Sitting around and waiting for a cure it’s silly you’re rejecting yourself before anyone even has a chance to think about it or reject you or accept you. You are putting limits on yourself before giving anyone else the opportunity to consider anything. People get rejected every day for a plethora of different reasons Sure there are people who ghosted me especially on tinder but as I talked to my friends I realized they got ghosted too and it wasn’t because of herpes it was because dating apps are cesspools in general. Dating nowadays sucks for so many reasons if you want to pin it on herpes go for it but that’s not the only reason. I was diagnosed with ghsv-1 at 19 and I thought my life was over I didn’t tell a soul cut off friends and everything because I felt so disgusting and gross. But eventually I put myself out there and had a few positive disclosure s and i began to realize that I was the one creating the stigma for myself.. The more people I told the less it weighted me down. Think of it logically friends should care because it doesn’t effect them. The only people your herpes effects are the people you are sleeping With. Friends are supposed to be your support system and if you tell them your story they should not judge you And they will learn from you And your experience. Hell you May even help a fellow herpes person out becuase if someone discloses to your friend after you teach them about herpes they will be more understanding and knowledgeable about it. But that’s up to you. I’ll attach some links that have seemed to help people and if you need anything please dm me.I’ve had it for almost a decade at this point and have a pretty good handle on it.

I do think it’s important to understand the different ways that HSV1 and HSV2 affect different body parts. Not so that we can further shame those who have HSV2, but so that people can understand shedding rates, outbreak patterns etc and how it applies to them. (Again, just so that the individual can have a better understanding of how to deal with whichever herpes/location they have).

But I agree. We have to stop the language that certain herpes is worse than others. Herpes is herpes. ### People need to acknowledge and appreciate the experience of others.

""Another cold sore, stupid stress haha!"" then shares her straws with her kids, nonchalant.

But she has made some super snarky remarks about genital herpes. ""Girl is such a slut, she probably has an STD like nasty herpes."" Other than this, she's a good friend so I don't want to start an argument.

It REALLY REALLY annoys me when people play the comparison game, like one type is better than the other. It's fucking herpes regardless of where it is.

Even chickenpox and shingles have ""herpes simplex"" in their names. While I know those are of a different breed, it's still technically the same in  a way; sores, contagious, symptoms include fever and body aches, etc.

I also strongly dislike the remarks that some viruses are better or worse than another. I have seen people state they'd rather have HIV so they can die. It's absolutely so disrespectful to those who have HIV, like they have less value. HIV is no longer a death sentence, it doesn't immediately turn into AIDS.

There's even comparison to genital warts, like herpes is so much worse. They are spread the same, the statistics are almost the same, risks are almost the same, yet herpes is always the absolute worst of them all.

No one makes jokes about genital warts. Herpes is always the one. Herpes provides some of the less overall health risks, so many other STDs cause horrible health problems if left untreated. Herpes doesn't cause infertility or cancer. Herpes doesn't cause liver damage.

No, it not only wouldn't be common, it wouldn't happen. During a first-time outbreak, herpes can sometimes cause symptoms similar to that a of a *flu* (ie headache, fever, body aches, light sensitivity, and swollen lymph nodes near the region of infection).

We had a few pecks on the lips and a few nose kisses. They said they were having no symptoms and haven’t had an outbreak in 4 years. I know shedding can’t occur though without symptoms. Do you know if it’s true that the incubation period may be for some 2-12 days (and up to 30?). My STI nurse said it could happen at anytime. I read the CDC site too. Just trying to learn more. Thanks again for your initial reply. I’ll pay attention to my symptoms in those ways. Any thoughts on when those may show up? ### > I know shedding can’t occur though without symptoms.

Uh, actually shedding certainly *can* occur without symptoms. Especially for oral hsv1 and genital hsv2. (much less common/likely with oral hsv2 or genital hsv1). Shedding in the absence of symptoms is known as *asymptomatic shedding*. 

However, while asymptomatic shedding makes transmission possible, it certainly doesn't guarantee it. The vast majority of exposures to asymptomatic shedding *don't* actually result in transmission. Plus, asymptomatic shedding would require considerably more contact to pose any risk than ""a few pecks on the lips and a few nose kisses."" If a person has oral herpes but no outbreak at the time, then a few pecks on the lips and a few nose kisses would pose zero risk.

Also, you said in your original post that your lips have been really dry. Herpes wouldn't cause that either. Herpes would not cause lip or skin dryness.

Another thing that might be worth mentioning here is that, in regard to flu-like symptoms, herpes would not cause secondary flu-like symptoms unless it were also causing *extensive* primary symptoms as well, ie blisters/lesions. The flu-like symptoms might start a day or so before the blisters/lesions appear, but unless there are a considerable number of obvious blisters/lesions within a day of the flu-like symptoms starting, the flu-like symptoms are not herpes related. ### Thank you for your thorough response. ### I noticed a few tiny red dots on my lower lip and one on my upper last night that was darker. It went away the same night or next day. I’ve never seen anything like it before so have a feeling or wonder if it is HSV-1. Does that seem like it could be? I could share a zoomed in photo cropped of it if that would help. I am going to call my STI clinic Monday to talk with the nurse too. From photos I’ve seen online I haven’t seen anything exactly like it although maybe it is. My lips are chapped too so maybe it was blood but I don’t think I’ve ever noticed that like that before and I usually taste blood if my lips are that dry. Does that make sense? ### ",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tcchwq/feels_like_a_cold_1st_time/
tccf1t,"Newbie I don’t know if I have HSV-1 Oral. I was seeing someone and we slept together 3 times over the course of a few months. They didn’t know HSV-1 was an STI (and I hear from a nurse it isn’t always). They told me they thought it couldn’t be spread without an outbreak. I feel completely crushed. So they told me (in a way that absolutely sucked). I decided to see them and we did some sexy time stuff and ended up sharing a few pecks. That was 6 days ago. I feel like my lips have been tingling/burning, now really fu*kin dry, and now wondering if I see a few little red dots or some different color on parts of my lip. They told me at the STI clinic on Monday that the best test is the site, not blood work. How do I cope when I’m not sure? I don’t want to add to the stigma meaning it’s the worst thing ever if I have it. It’s more so the shame of how this happened and that I caused this. How do people handle future partners? The STI nurse said it’s not something you need to share with future partners? That seems non consenting. Maybe she meant if I don’t show symptoms cause she said so many have it. Anyways, just ramblings now. I see there’s so many posts on here so not sure if some one or people can answer?

I find the timing strange that they told me this time even though they said the reason they did is because they just learned about it.

tc4min,"Questions I very recently tested positive for hvs2, so I applogize if I sound dumb, I'm still learning and I  have a couple questions.. 

My doc recommended that only take valacyclovir when I have an ob. Saying that long term medication has some adverse side effects. Though I worry by not taking suppressive medication I'll have more ob and I won't feel as comfortable having sex with someone, even with protection and no ob. Is my doctor right? Or is daily medication the way to go?

I'm also wondering about asymptomatic shedding. I've had 2 ob in 5 months (this second time is when I was tested) is it likely that people who have symptoms can also have an ob with no symptoms?

I'm still trying my best to accept that this is my life now, and honestly any advise would be greatly appreciated.",7,2022-03-11 19:49:21-05:00,">My doc recommended that only take valacyclovir when I have an ob. Saying that long term medication has some adverse side effects. 

Your doctor is incorrect. Only 5% of people experience any side effects from herpes medication at all -- the most common of which are headache and/or nausea, and which usually clear within a few weeks of staying on the medication. More serious side effects are possible but rare, and are not related to long-term use. In the very unlikely event that problematic side-effects occur then the medication can simply be discontinued.

Some people have concerns regarding the safety of herpes medications. They sometimes hear somewhere that they might be bad for the liver, or the kidneys, or just generally bad in some way.

Here are some direct quotes from a highly regarded herpes expert, Terri Warren, who has a 35+ year career researching and treating herpes *specifically*, and who also regularly collaborates with the experts at the University of Washington, who are considered some of the top herpes experts in the *world* (eg Larry Corey, Anna Wald, Christine Johnson, Zane Brown, etc), and with whom her opinions regarding the safety of herpes medications are in agreement with:


A patient asked:

>if I take Valtrex daily to reduce transmission risk, should I get regular bloodwork to ensure my liver is ok?

And Terri replied:

>You do not need any bloodwork done when taking herpes medicines daily, no, it has no impact on the liver.

([Source](https://www.westoverheights.com/forum/question/valtrex-questions/))


>There are no known potential liver problems with these medicines. If you are reading that somewhere, I don’t believe it is reliable information.

([Source](https://www.westoverheights.com/forum/question/why-now-follow-up/))


A client asked:

>I’m also really worried about the long-term side effect of taking Valacyclovir daily for myself ... Is this going to affect my kidney or liver or other parts of my body if I need to take it for the next 10 or 20 years?

And Terri replied:

>It is safe to continue taking the medicine indefinitely, with the data we have currently. We see no side effects that are concerning and in fact, no blood work is suggested for people on long term treatment.

([Source](https://westoverheights.com/forum/question/long-term-effect-on-valacyclovir/))


A client asked:

>How long can you take valtrex supressive therapy for? or will it destroy your kidney if taken for so long? or cause other issues? 

And Terri replied:

>We’ve had patients on suppressive therapy for 30 years and we have good data that long term therapy is safe and effective.

([Source](https://westoverheights.com/forum/question/herpes-and-insomnia-and-cbd/))


A client asked: 

>should I have kidney/liver function tests each year? I do not have any health issues at the moment.

And Terri replied: 

>The only people who need to worry about this are people who for some other reason, have reduced kidney function but there is no indication that people on suppression should have any routine blood work done.

([Source](https://westoverheights.com/forum/question/please-help-unsure-if-hsv1/))


A client asked:

>I have read that Valtrex is bad for the kidneys. I am in my mid twenties and haven’t had any major health issues aside from HSV2.I am worried that Valtrex might cause serious health issues in the long term. Is this a valid concern or are those false accusations relating to kidney damage?

And Terri replied:

>It is not bad for kidneys in the long term. However, people *who already have kidney function impairment* would need to alter their dose of Valtrex.

([Source](https://westoverheights.com/forum/question/ghsv2-transmission-rate/))


In response to a client reporting that they experienced kidney issues following Valtrex use:

>This is not common but has been documented. Normally, it happens in people *who have some kidney issues to start with* and taking this medicine makes it known.

([Source](https://westoverheights.com/forum/question/reaction-following-valacyclovir/))


>There are no negative consequences for long term use of acyclovir or valacyclovir. This has been studied for long term use. If for any reason in the future you develop kidney issues (not from the medicine), you should tell the prescriber and they may change the dose according to kidney function.

([Source](https://westoverheights.com/forum/question/suppression/))


A patient asked:

>Valtrex – does this reduce the risk of transmission? Is this to be taken daily and indefinitely? What are the side effects of long term use?

And Terri replied:

>It does reduce the risk of transmission by almost half if taken daily. Very few side effects and no impact of long term therapy.

([Source](https://www.westoverheights.com/forum/question/hsv-2-western-blot-to-confirm/))


A patient asked:

>What is your opinion of the safety of a healthy person being on Val 500 2x’s a day for lets say 10 or more years?

And Terri replied:

>Very safe – we just see no danger signals with long term use of this class of medication to treat herpes. I have had patients on this drug for 30 years

([Source](https://www.westoverheights.com/forum/question/suppressive-therapy-3/))

> No. I have had patients on acyclovir or valacyclovir for 30 years.

And some additional quotes:

>Antiviral medicines do not take a toll on your body – they simply reduce viral shedding and transmission.

>we do not see any long term problems at all with this medicine.

Etc. ### There is no right or wrong answer as to daily suppression. It's a decision that only you can make.

Every medication has side effects, and just like with aspirin or allergy meds or anything, you may experience some or none with antivirals. 

Antivirals can cause kidney damage in people who already have kidney disease, but are generally considered safe long term for those who are otherwise healthy. 

Do your research, read all the possible side effects and make your decision based on that. 

If your doctor won't prescribe it, and you want it, find another doctor or you can get them online. In the US, you can use Wisp, Lemonaid, GoodRx, GetRoman, and several others. 

You can also tell your doctor that you are dating someone who is hsv2 negative, and want to reduce transmission. Only daily suppression does this. ### This is a very good question and I am
In the same exact boat as you. I’ve had 2 ob in 4 months currently dealing with my second one as we speak. I don’t believe in taking any medication daily no matter what it is. Unfortunately you just have to wait it out and see the first year how it goes. If you find yourself having frequent ob such as monthly, you can try a 3 month suppressive period of meds. But for now see how your body reacts the first year is my best advice. ### Dr is right to a certain extent. I think people worry about taking it for many years probably affects the liver? You could ask about taking it for a year and see where you’re at. Personally I’d only do daily if I had a lot of outbreaks or I was with someone without herpes. 
As far as I know you’re either symptomatic or not. Can spread with both but lower probably being asymptomatic. ### it’s been 4 months for me and i don’t take anything ### >Dr is right to a certain extent. I think people worry about taking it for many years probably affects the liver? 

No, the doctor was mistaken. Please see my reply to OP. ### Good to know ### ",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tc4min/questions/
tc2063,"Need reassurance after a breakup Hello, 

I (25 M) just got out of a 5 year relationship with the woman who gave me HSV2. She had promised we’d be together forever. I was young and obviously extremely naive. I just need to know if there are others out there who have HSV2 before their current relationship and are in happy romantic and sexual relationships? Is there any hope for me to have a romantic and sexual relationship with someone with/out it in the future or is it basically over? I need honesty even if it’s not what I want to hear. Thank you in advance.",32,2022-03-11 17:35:05-05:00,"Hi OP, first I want to go ahead and advise you to try not to get caught up with type 1 or type 2 because at the end of the same it’s all herpes and one isn’t better over the other one. 

Moving forward, I remember when I started dating again after my diagnosis. I read a lot about how to handle it and how to disclose it, how long to wait, etc. I was going on dates, but they never went past the first date so I didn’t ever disclose my condition until I got into my first serious relationship a whole year and a half after my diagnosis.

Everything I read said people waited about a month in or at least until they were getting serious to disclose it. I thought my boyfriend and I would causally date for sometime before I would tell him, but we ended up being exclusive really fast. Like after a week. I prepped myself and gave myself another week before I would tell him. I didn’t want to tell him over text or over phone call. It needed to be in person. I already prepared and refreshed myself on HSV facts and  statistics just in case he had any questions for me. Everyone I read said their partners had a lot of follow up questions before ultimately being okay with it. 

 I chose not to say “herpes” right away and call it “a condition” instead because some people hear that word and go into panic mode and not hear anything you have to say after that, so I planned on easing into it in the same sentence towards the end before I would open the floor for questions. But when it came time to sit with him, I blanked out and panicked I just ended my sentence abruptly. The following interaction went like this starting with my disclosure and him blank faced the entire time:

Me: so, because of a previous relationship, I have … this condition that’s with me for life. I take medicine for once it in a while because it only happens sometimes… but this is something I’ve had for over a year now, and before we move forward together I just needed you to know so you can have that choice...

Him: …is it an STD?

Me: …Yeah…

Him: what is it?

Me: herpes 

Him: doesn’t everyone have that?

Me: basically.

Him: okay.

*Moments of silence and just staring at each other.*

Me: …okay?

Him: yeah, okay.

And he just stared at me. I waited and waited for a question. A comment. Nothing. He just stared at me. Then he pulled me in and just hugged me. “Thank you for telling me,” he said without letting me go. “I know that was incredibly difficult for you to do. I don’t think any less of you because of it. I like you, and I accept *all* of you. And if that’s a part of you then I accept that, too.”

I was just sobbing into his neck. I had been so afraid of the outcome and it ended up being the exact opposite of what I was already anticipating. He barely knew me, yet was so accepting of me. 

We’re married now. 

Disclosing is scary. *really* scary. And you might get some rejections before you find the one who won’t mind it. I was really lucky enough that my first one accepted me. I promise you, OP, as long as you’re honest and completely transparent about it, the right woman won’t even care about it. She might even know more about herpes than you think she does and you won’t even have to explain/educate any further. She’s out there. And you might have to kiss some frogs to find her, but she’ll love and accept *all* of you. For *you* 💜 ### I've disclosed to 3 people since my divorce and diagnosis via blood test. I only slept with one of them but that was my choice. None of them cared. They all thanked me for being honest. One told me my disclosure made him like me even more. 

I found I'm more selective in who I date and choose people that are genuinely kind and accepting. You'll be ok. ### Love is out there! Even though I’ve stuck mostly to people in the same boat as me I’ve still had three great relationships since 2017 , just things happened that couldn’t make them long term. I just broke with someone and thinking about trying my luck with muggles but I’m nervous. ### Hey mate, you'll be fine! I was nervous about it too after my breakup and deliberately put off dating because I was scared of rejection. Wasted a lot of time and missed out on possibly good things! Eventually I got tired of missing out and came to miss intimacy a lot.

I've disclosed a few times now and never been rejected for it. The main thing is to be direct, honest, confident and calm about it. Keep it brief and dont act like you have the plague; know your worth. Get educated on hsv so you can answer questions confidently. 

Oh, and all this stuff about waiting months - nah - if you find the right girl and you have a good feeling, go with your gut. I do three dates now and then disclose. By that point I've figured out if I like them enough to want a relationship and I've decided whether I think they are kind and non-judgemental and also mature enough to handle disclosure. If I dont feel they are, I don't continue seeing them and dont disclose. I think its important to be realistic - don't just think you can drop disclosure on a girl on your first date, because you will know barely anything about their character at that point and you will have not built a rapport. But don't wait for months to go by; it's just not necessary and ultimately they may reject you anyway. It's about getting a good sense of the person and your connection. 

Disclosing after 3 (good, long) dates has worked great for me and it allows me to get the disclosure over before serious deep feelings have been established, so if I am rejected I'm not going to be cut up about it. As I say though, I've never been rejected. Questions, doubts, worries, mild freakout, sure - that's to be expected from them, but I've always had a positive response after 24 hours, they just need time to process. 

Also, my advice - don't do it in person, every girl I've disclosed to has specifically thanked me for doing it over text since it takes away the pressure from them and doesn't put them on the spot. This is an important point given that you will find most people you disclose to know nothing about hsv except for the dreaded word ""HeRpEs"" and the stigma around it, and they will need time to research/educate themselves about it. ### You got this OP.

My boyfriend didn’t care and proceeded to have sex with me the same night. We are going to get engaged this year, been together for two. You would be surprised how not a big deal it is and how little follow up questions he had. I told him he could ask but also do his own research before he makes a decision and he was fine with that! ### Thank you to everyone who has answered so far🧡 I feel a ton of relief and peace within me knowing it’s possible. I appreciate you all so much 🧡🧡🧡 ### I’m never sure if I should post this—I think other people have said the most important things, that even though disclosure is often hard and can be really nerve-wracking, it often goes well and there are many, many people who will still want to date you. 

But for people in this group who are terrified that you’ll never date again post-diagnosis—there are dating apps that are just for people who are positive for herpes or other STIs, and you can select to find people who have only the same diagnoses as you. 

Positive Singles is the main one that’s out there and the only one I’ve personally used. 

It’s also a decent place just to meet other people to talk about living with herpes with—they have forums not too different from this subreddit, a blog section where people post about their experiences, and a lot of other resources.

I just never want anyone who’s new to being diagnosed and dating to imagine that Positive Singles or other similar apps are your only options—really, truly you will find great people who are more understanding than you’d ever imagine. They’re out there! ### Hey I understand the depression I was depressed for years until I finally decided enough was enough. I have been diagnosed for 10 years and have had  20+ partners since diagnosis. None of them to their knowledge have genital herpes some had cold sores. I am currently with a guy who is completely HSV negative he works at a blood lab and took a test just for shits and giggles.  He knows about my herpes I disclosed and he is completely fine with it and accepts the risks. There are plenty of people like this who do not care. Sitting around and waiting for a cure it’s silly you’re rejecting yourself before anyone even has a chance to think about it or reject you or accept you. You are putting limits on yourself before giving anyone else the opportunity to consider anything. People get rejected every day for a plethora of different reasons Sure there are people who ghosted me especially on tinder but as I talked to my friends I realized they got ghosted too and it wasn’t because of herpes it was because dating apps are cesspools in general. Dating nowadays sucks for so many reasons if you want to pin it on herpes go for it but that’s not the only reason. I was diagnosed with ghsv-1 at 19 and I thought my life was over I didn’t tell a soul cut off friends and everything because I felt so disgusting and gross. But eventually I put myself out there and had a few positive disclosure s and i began to realize that I was the one creating the stigma for myself.. The more people I told the less it weighted me down. Think of it logically friends should care because it doesn’t effect them. The only people your herpes effects are the people you are sleeping With. Friends are supposed to be your support system and if you tell them your story they should not judge you And they will learn from you And your experience. Hell you May even help a fellow herpes person out becuase if someone discloses to your friend after you teach them about herpes they will be more understanding and knowledgeable about it. But that’s up to you. I’ll attach some links that have seemed to help people and if you need anything please dm me.I’ve had it for almost a decade at this point and have a pretty good handle on it.

This first link is info about a support group I’m in. All herpes people from all over the world we all share are experiences, vent , swap info and remedies, and just talk about life it’s an awesome place to be for sure.

I was wrong.

For a couple of month I‘ve been with the most wonderful man you could imagine.
Before we became intimate I told him about my diagnosis. After he just looked me dead in the eye and asked „and that‘s the horrible thing u needed to tell me?“
We‘ve been inseparable ever since. 

You are worthy of love, with or without a diagnosis. Fuck the stigma around it. If you‘re person comes along, they won‘t care. They will only care for you. 
Don’t be ashamed and be honest about it - not to everyone, just the ones you choose to become intimate with. Be selective with who you are dating. There is more at stake when dating you and you yourself need to be aware of whom you want to share yourself with. I found it to be actually a great chance at love, because the one who wants to be with you, even though you have been diagnosed with an incurable STD, is the real deal. ### When did you get it from her in the relationship? ### Thank you so much for your response 🧡😭 I feel super relieved.

Thank you either way 🙏 ### 🧡 ### I don’t understand why it’s necessarily relevant? I just want to know if being in a new relationship is possible ### Transmission rates decrease over time, maybe ^^ were going to explain that, how stats about 3 months after v 5 years after would change your chances of giving it to someone else. ### I see !

Sounds like you guys already had herpes. You're not specifying type 1 or 2. Anyhow, if you tested + right after an ob and she tested + without an ob that seems like you have been having it for some time and she's def been having it. She might have given it to you from her other partner. ### No I had bumps on my penis about 2 weeks after getting oral from the other female.

tbubo6,I just want to love freely. I love somebody by staying away to protect us both. I hope the cure will come as soon as possible. ,11,2022-03-11 11:49:53-05:00,"Hey I understand the depression I was depressed for years until I finally decided enough was enough. I have been diagnosed for 10 years and have had  20+ partners since diagnosis. None of them to their knowledge have genital herpes some had cold sores. I am currently with a guy who is completely HSV negative he works at a blood lab and took a test just for shits and giggles.  He knows about my herpes I disclosed and he is completely fine with it and accepts the risks. There are plenty of people like this who do not care. Sitting around and waiting for a cure it’s silly you’re rejecting yourself before anyone even has a chance to think about it or reject you or accept you. You are putting limits on yourself before giving anyone else the opportunity to consider anything. People get rejected every day for a plethora of different reasons Sure there are people who ghosted me especially on tinder but as I talked to my friends I realized they got ghosted too and it wasn’t because of herpes it was because dating apps are cesspools in general. Dating nowadays sucks for so many reasons if you want to pin it on herpes go for it but that’s not the only reason. I was diagnosed with ghsv-1 at 19 and I thought my life was over I didn’t tell a soul cut off friends and everything because I felt so disgusting and gross. But eventually I put myself out there and had a few positive disclosure s and i began to realize that I was the one creating the stigma for myself.. The more people I told the less it weighted me down. Think of it logically friends should care because it doesn’t effect them. The only people your herpes effects are the people you are sleeping With. Friends are supposed to be your support system and if you tell them your story they should not judge you And they will learn from you And your experience. Hell you May even help a fellow herpes person out becuase if someone discloses to your friend after you teach them about herpes they will be more understanding and knowledgeable about it. But that’s up to you. I’ll attach some links that have seemed to help people and if you need anything please dm me.I’ve had it for almost a decade at this point and have a pretty good handle on it.

Please reach out if you need anything!! I promise it gets bettertr ### Check out r/HerpesCureResearch friend. Alot of exciting advancements incoming! All we have to do is promote our cause and keep a positive mind set! We will get there. ### Omg I feel the same!! I want to feel love. I don't want to tell them my secret! Everyone says this isn't a big deal. I've had this for 11 years. I'm still struggling. I'm depressed. Who would want this? The way I feel I wouldn't want to put this on anyone else. I don't want to be a risk. If I ever gave this to anyone and they shut down the way I did, I'd feel horrible. I want a cure ### does that person know that you are protecting them in this way? its a small risk if you take precautions and ultimately its just a skin condition. your partner deserves to make fully informed decisions. if i had the opportunity to be loved, i'd risk a skin condition. ### Thank you ### A cure would be such a blessing, I would forever be grateful ### I feel like he’ll have opportunity to love without this mindhurt ### You have decided this is a mindhurt, and aren't giving him the choice to love you back. 

We talk about disclosure here to give people the right to make informed decisions about their bodies and health, but you aren't giving this person the right to do that. You're making it for him. 

You've posted a lot about how much you're struggling. Are you in therapy? Have you talked to your doctor about depression? I know it's so easy to feel stuck when you're in a depression, but you can feel better. You just have to take the first step. ### I reached out to a support organisation and they in part advised me not to disclose. Which didn’t fit and made me feel worse as I wouldn’t lie. I would like to speak to a counsellor specialised in hsv. I feel distraught ### Wow that's horrible. I'm sorry that happened. 

You might not find a counselor that specializes in hsv, but if you found one that specializes in sexuality or sexual health matters, they would probably know about herpes. 

Do a google search for ""counselors your town sexual health"". I just tried that where I live, and got a lot, though I live in a big city, but also had to wade through some that specialize in kink stuff. I tried ""counselors your town sexuality"", and got some, too. I tried STDs instead, and just got a bunch of places to test. 

But really, you're having suicidal thoughts - just get into therapy. Find one that specializes in depression at least - that's most important right now. ### Thank you, I think I have found an option from google search ### ",10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tbubo6/i_just_want_to_love_freely_i_love_somebody_by/

Also I got lip filler about two weeks ago. I have only kissed one person in my entire life but that was almost 6 months ago. Also I shared a drink with a few friends a few weeks ago. Does this look like herpes to you?

tc3cdx,"Need Advice so i’ve had GHSV1 for over 2 years now, no outbreak other than the initial, and i’m still having a really hard time accepting myself and my status. I know in the grand scheme of things it’s not a big deal at all. it’s just a skin condition. the nasty things i tell myself i would never in a million years tell another HSV+ stranger because I really just tell myself these nasty things to bring myself down, but I often believe the things I tell myself. I’m wondering what has helped people overcome their negative feelings about status? Like the shame, low self esteem, embarrassment, etc. It’s been a long time and I have honestly just been feeling worse about my status as time goes on. I just recently started therapy to work towards self love and mindfulness. If anyone has any other tips of what helped them I would really appreciate it.",11,2022-03-11 18:41:27-05:00,"The more people I’ve told, the easier it’s become, because it’s no big deal to most including sexual partners once they learn how HSV works.

By facing my fears and disclosing to protect my partners, I have something to be proud about. ### You say you wouldn't tell another HSV+ stranger these things. What would you tell your best friend? Sister? Mother? Someone you love. 

If they came to you and said they had ghsv1, and they felt all the same things you felt, what would you tell them? Would you look at your best friend and say, ""Omg, how embarrassing. You must be so ashamed. It's so nasty. Like, I get that it's just a skin disease, but you must have super low self-esteem because it's herpes!"" 

I'm guessing not. Start talking to yourself as your own best friend. Imagine what you would say if she was talking to you, with your concerns, and tell yourself that. Imagine saying these things to someone you love, as you should be loving yourself. 

You have a virus that 67% of people under 50 globally - that's 3.7 billion people - have. You can't all be gross and nasty and whatever it is you tell yourself. 

I'm so happy you've started therapy. Have you told your therapist you have ghsv1? Therapy really helps. You're already on the right track. 💖

Don't treat yourself ways that you'd call abusive if anyone else did it. ### Therapy is wonderful! Don't give up and don't punish yourself for feeling bad! It may just take a long time. I'm sure the shame and pain doesn't come solely from the diagnosis, but can really trigger those ways of thinking. It took me four years, therapy, friends, a relationship, risks, failures, graduation, travel to really even accept myself as someone who is okay being positive. When you feel the good moments ie, feeling cute, feeling excited, joyful, happy, confident (herpes related or not), lean into them and give yourself the chance to celebrate. Those good feelings may be fleeting at first, but flex your muscles in allowing yourself the right to feel good! Pain and suffering will come and go. That is the nature of life! 

Two quotes I love LOVE so much by Bell Hooks that have helped:  


""At times we will all be confronted with suffering, an unexpected illness, a loss. That pain will come whether we choose it or not and not one of us can escape it. The presence of pain in our lives is not an indicator of dysfunction.""

  
""We have to expose the falseness of these beliefs to see and accept the reality that suffering and pain do not end when we begin to love. In some cases when we are making the slow journey back from lovelessness to love, our suffering may become more intense. As the lyrics of old-time spirituals testify, ""Weeping may endure for a night but joy will come in the morning."" Acceptance of pain is part of loving practice. It enables us to distinguish constructive suffering from self-indulgent hurt . When love's promise has never been fulfilled in our lives it is perhaps the most difficult practice of love to trust that the passage through the painful abyss leads to paradise."" ### I told most my friends and I disclose it to all new potential partners. It’s made it feel incredibly normal. I do tell strangers sometimes too - like I disclosed to a friend when we were hanging out with two of his friends I didn’t really know. You would not believe the number of positive conversations, support, and number of other people who have herpes who will be glad you said something. ### thanks i really appreciate this as disclosing is one of my fears i rlly need to overcome ### thank you this made me feel so much better 💜 ### Also my depression manifests pretty prominently in neglect. When I am depressed or struggling, I neglect to take care of my physical self which has a staggeringly DIRECT impact on my mental self. I don't shower, eat, sleep, clean, treat my outbreaks (I'm pretty much constantly outbreaking) and I spiral. Those become bad habits learned and good habits neglected. 

The best thing would be to work on your body as soon as you can. Don't pressure yourself, but know that once you begin you are closer to being who you want to be/who you know you are/who you can be. Like with all work and discipline it is incredibly difficult to start. Start small. Sleep is BIG for me. Start with one thing, like a proper bed time. Work on that for a few weeks. Be consistent. Hold yourself to your goals. Don't slip. Then start adding in other things. A morning routine. Making it to two meals a day. Taking supplements. Be graceful, accepting, compassionate, and stern with yourself. Be honest. 

Know that it just takes spoonfuls and bowlfuls and heaps and mountains of time, but the best way to spend that time is to work hard against those thought patterns as best you can. I spent a lot of time hating myself and hurling vicious thoughts my way. I spent a lot of time telling myself that I would never be touched or loved again. When my now-ex and I were together I was fraught with fear and self-loathing and disgust and stress because I couldn't even process the fact that he loved me and was willing to spend time with me and touch me. We broke up for a few reasons, but I wished I had told my younger self not to spend as much time actively hating who I was and take a step back. We may not have been together for ever, and we needed to end things because I needed to stand on my own and love who I am, but I lost a lot of really precious moments to self-hate and self-doubt. It was a huge wake-up call. 

I'm not saying this to scare you, fear is always always the wrong way to go, but know that you are good enough for yourself to love. You always have been. I can see in your post that you are waiting, hoping, yearning for self love, and that is a gift you CAN give, well, yourself! And it's something you are more than capable of giving! You have it in you to get better, to let go, to ease out of the tension and pain in your head. Self love is consistency, it is honesty, it is bravery, it is hard. It will come I promise. ### thanks im glad to hear you’re very open about it ### You're welcome, I hope it helped. 💖 ### wow i relate so much. thank you so much I really appreciate this 💕 ### of course! wishing you love and success <3 ### ",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tc3cdx/need_advice/
tc1n37,"Disclosing to someone you’d have to see everyday So I contracted this virus (GHSV-1) 8-9 months ago and have only had one (semi-positive) disclosure. Although this has been my only disclosure and I have yet to try again. I think that I’m far more comfortable trying to date men outside of my “everyday life” (avoid: school, work, friend group) because it poses less of a risk of drama and heartache. 

Now my predicament here is that I’ve developed this crush on a guy that I have classes with and I have a good idea that he is also attracted to me. But my fear is: one ruining the friendship if he denies me due to my condition and two having to see him in class after disclosing (if things don’t go well).

I never want to restrict myself with this virus because you never know who may also have it. What if I pass up this opportunity while he may be completely compatible?

Additional: I also have a history of avoiding strong feelings as this protects me from getting hurt. But I’m really trying to be vulnerable, I haven’t felt this way about someone in a long time.

Do you guys have any advice about sharing such information with someone you have to spend time with often? Should I wait to make any advances till I don’t have to see him a lot? Or just say F it cause your girls got the feels right now! Is there a healthy in between suggestion?",2,2022-03-11 17:17:34-05:00,"I haven’t announced it to a ton of people but I’m starting to think about it. Who cares if everyone knows we have it? It doesn’t really matter… and we do have it, so we shouldn’t really be scared to let people know we have it. The more people know the more normal it gets ### If it’s someone I want to be with sexually, I talk about “when I got sick” as a means to start the conversation. It is a condition that can be managed. 

I assume you’re also talking about STI with potential partners as well. It should be part of that conversation. 

For people I’ve known for a while, the conversation starts with, “I want to tell you about a change in my STI status”. 

If you’re forward, being responsible and caring about the other person’s health, I’ve found that creates a level of vulnerability which is the beginnings of trust. 

I also ask my partners to get tested. If they have it and are asymptomatic, then we would have “viral compatibility” and it’s a non issue. If they’re negative, then we know to take precautions and get regularly tested. 

There’s no 100% safe sex. If your partners are not willing to acknowledge that through general serious conversation, then I’d probably stay just friends.

Please reach out if you need anything!! ### Take red marine algae, seriously. Game changer ### Try and pay that shit no mind I don’t even like to be around ppl wen my shit is breaking I feel u tho it should get better ### i think i can help. go natural with holistic meds, they really work and they work way better that prescribed meds. herpes can’t and won’t build a resistance to anything natural/holistic ### My symptoms faded with 3-4 days of antivirals. You may want to ask your doctor for another medication if it’s not working for a long time. ### I feel this exact way. It feels like i can literally never have sex ever again. It’s all so painful & it sucks having to constantly hide it from everyone and act completely normal when you’re really not. I’ve truly been trying to figure out how to deal with it but it’s a constant breakdown whenever I had hope that it got better but then it ended up getting worse. ### I feel exactly the same. I'm really sorry you are going through this as well. 😞 ### Is it your first one ? ### Applying manuka honey might help, read about it...it ain't cheap tho! Also, messy haha. ### It will get better just give it time babe, I know it’s hard and stressful but try to destress as stress can cause OB’s. Try an Epson salt bath, also lysine supplements and I would maybe suggest trying some elderberry syrup it helps to boost your immune system and herpes can hit hard when your immune system is down! Also stay away from tight fitted clothing like leggings and make sure to wear 100% cotton underwear! Sending love and prayers your way! You will get through this! ❤️❤️❤️ ### I feel your pain. My first OB lasted me over 4 weeks. I was trying to trudge through it but the pain was so bad and I was so depressed and miserable. When I had my first one, meds felt like it maybe helped a little but not a whole lot. It was still pretty bad. But it’s because this the first one. The first one is *always* the worst. I recommend getting a prescription for acyclovir gel or cream since the pain is still so bad. Whenever the meds get like they weren’t doing anything, I put that gel on and it helped TREMENDOUSLY. If anything, I always make sure I keep some of that gel handy in case it ever gets really, really painful because that stuff is a lifesaver. 

The first year after the first OB is HARD but after a year they should subside a tremendous amount. I was having OBs (less frequent) after every period for about a year and a half. And they would last like 2-3 weeks and I always felt like by the time I was getting over that OB, my period was back and I was starting a NEW one. I get like I only maybe had a week pain free at most. They would have been so much better if I was actually taking medication every day or during those times but I wasn’t and that’s why they were bad. But it’s been two years now and they’re less painful and more infrequent. I even forget I have it now.


If it’s ever super painful it’s because I ate foods with high amounts of arginine so I’ve had to kind of somewhat change my diet. Granted, it hasn’t been proven that certain foods actually trigger an outbreak, but personally I’ve noticed triggers when I eat certain things like chocolate, but mostly bacon. I’ve had to cut bacon out of my diet completely because it triggers really bad OBs for me. Doc especially during this time OP, I recommend slightly changing your diet at least until the pain subsides. Probiotics also helped me. 

You got this, OP. The emotional toll that comes with it is absolutely devastating, and I thought I would never be happy again. But over time I found that to be untrue. Right now, focus on remedying the pain. Then take it one day at a time. Your mental health needs it. ### Not sure if you’re hsv1 or 2. My initial outbreak lasted three weeks from start to finish, and I was suicidal for most of it. Two saturdays ago was my worst. I was all cleared up, physically, but emotionally was just unwell.

I’ve been okay since then, but I have moments where I’m scared of a second OB. I’m really nervous. But I’m okay right now. May not be if symptoms show up again. ### Go get it looked at. What I thought was a never ending recurring outbreak turned out to be molluscum. Fucking sucks ### Have you tried changing your diet as well? Or taking supplements like l-lysine, vitamin c & zinc? 
Avoid or eat sparingly foods high in arginine (the amino acid that the virus uses to replicate) such as chocolate, coconut, nuts, seeds & grains. ### It will mess with your mental health for a bit. Try not to stress too much from it. It will only cause more flare ups to happen. Focus on your daily things ams taking care of your health and diet. It will help out physically and mentally. In due time it will be gone and you will be back to normal ### Not getting sleep is a trigger for me so be sure to get your rest in ### It’s perfectly normal to feel what you’re feeling. I’ve meet a few good people on Positive Singles.  Although it’s a dating app I’ve been able to speak with many people suffering from HSV 1 &2. While not everyone experiences the same things. The one thing they’ve all had in common was that it gets better.  I’ve met a few whom also wanted to take their lives and after many years have regretted the thought.  Be patient.  Try to learn your body. See What triggers the outbreaks. Take supplements Lysine, vitamin B, zinc, and vitamin c. I’m sure there are other supplements you can take.  Avoid chocolate, coffee and try to decrease your sugar intake. Keep the immune system strong and most importantly avoid stress.  Stress is a major contributor to most outbreaks.  I’m the meantime join support groups and understand that some people can be Insensitive so just prepare yourself for that.  I’m new to this virus and I’ve had several outbreaks.  I’m hopeful that after the first 2 years my outbreaks aren’t as frequent. Good luck. Remain hopeful. And God bless.  We have it. So now we just need to deal with it until a cure is found. ### That super sucks, have you tried alternative anti-virals?  Some people have more success with others ### Try lysine ### Thank you so much. ### >https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E6uCpRELkIdFFqtTcYLkdC-3Zo50O4EEqaXJ-5j2cC8/edit

I'm hoping to get into a casual thing with somebody else that I met previously. We seem well matched, and I want to make sure that I disclose with good resources to backup the disclosure.  

There was a resource I saw earlier that was copypasted by a mod (with no link), saying that with condoms and meds, male to female transmission can be around <1%. Does anyone have access to any data on this subject?",5,2022-03-11 10:33:59-05:00,"This is a disclosure guide with “scripts” on how to tell potential partners about herpes and what had worked for us.

tc4mb4,"Herpes inside the mouth? I got diagnosed with genital herpes about a year ago. My partner and I still engage in intercourse. 

In the past, I’d get canker sores all the time. But I guess now I’m just paranoid that engaging in sex with my partner has now caused me to pass Herpes from my genitals to inside of mouth.

Could it have been possible to contract Herpes inside the mouth? On the inner cheeks or inner gums? Maybe from oral sex to kissing right after? 

I would post a picture, but it says this community doesn’t all attaching a photo?",5,2022-03-11 19:49:02-05:00,">Also, my outbreaks are weird. I am fortunate to not experience outbreaks often, but they never fully form? Last outbreak looked more like color discoloration and I’m still unsure if that was an actual outbreak or not? 

I just asked you on your other post whether you've ever actually been testing and know for certain you have herpes because it isn't clear.

In regard to your question about possibly having caught herpes orally via kissing your partner after they've performed oral sex on you: That would be *extremely* unlikely and, generally speaking, only possible at all during the first 4 months of your genital infection. Even during the first 4 months, it would not have been a practical risk unless your partner happened to perform oral sex on you when you had an actual outbreak present.

Once you are infected with a type of herpes in one location, you become largely protected from getting infected with the same type of herpes in another location at a later point in time, whether by spreading an existing infection on yourself, or getting exposed to a partner's infection. This is because after you are infected with herpes, your body creates antibodies to fight the virus. Your body maintains these antibodies in your bloodstream and they protect you from further infection. Different people generate antibodies at different rates, but by about 4 months post-infection the vast majority of people will have enough antibodies to prevent any further infection by the same type. Many people will have sufficient antibodies a lot sooner than that (eg after several weeks).

There are very rare exceptions to the above but that is the general rule.

Furthermore, an established genital hsv2 infection not only protects against any further hsv2 infections but also protects from any later hsv1 infections as well. People who catch hsv2 don't catch hsv1 after. But the opposite isn't true: people with hsv1 can still catch hsv2. ### It's possible ### Thank you so much for the in depth info! Another idea was that maybe I did infect my partner, but they’re asymptomatic, and got it orally inside my mouth after performing oral sex on them. 

Tbh, I still get so paranoid and sometimes get in my head while sex is happening. I hate how herpes has made sex so less enjoyable because I’m constantly in my head. This is mainly due to not understanding my body and the virus yet. I am SO grateful to have little or no outbreaks, but they are so mild that it doesn’t look like outbreaks because they never develop full term like I see in so many photos. Mine just look like color discoloration and it’s hard to tell ### Post removed, as per your clarification on your other post. You are making a lot of assumptions here. ### I apologize.

If you start to feel tingling that’s typically the start of the outbreak and most of the time first outbreaks give the person flu like symptoms such as a fever, sore/achey muscles and the sores typically begin to start right around that time because your body is trying to fight off the virus.

So this is about the 3rd or 4th time I have experienced this over the last few years however this is the worst I have experienced it. 

The last time I had this was January 2021, I took a photo of it back then and it was similar In appearance however only a much smaller less angry looking sore. 

Symptoms each time is just a feeling of irritation and itch, it’s not painful, at the most it’s a mild discomfort. I can easily sit down for long periods of time, walk around etc. When I poop it’s almost relieving as it kind of scratches the itch. When I wipe it’s more of a mild discomfort but also relieving as it’s also scratching the itch, but might be more painful if I wiped harder. I do not feel unwell, I have no flu like symptoms or fever. 

I do not recall any primary outbreak, but I do recall similar symptoms from time to time over the years, usually just assuming it’s a heat rash or jock itch as I have had reoccurrences of jock itch in groin area which goes away with anti fungals. Have never been unwell with any outbreak. I am not really run down or stressed. Usually when I get it, it might last a week or so. However this time it has been about 2 weeks, not getting better, not getting worse but this is definitely the worst I have had it. 

If a herpes outbreak was this big, I’d assume it would be extremely painful, which this isn’t? This is also the worst I’ve had it but it’s about the 3rd or 4th occurrence, usually with herpes the first OB is the worst? I also don’t have any swollen glands as far as I can find.

Let’s also assume I’ve been exposed to herpes at some point in my life over the years.

I still get outbreaks on the meds but they aren’t as frequent or as severe. That could be from the meds but it could also be from my body adjusting to the virus. When I feel an outbreak coming on I just take an extra daily pill for about 5 days. The only side effect from the pill I’ve noticed is having to drink more water. I don’t think OBs take any longer to heal; anywhere from 2 weeks to a month.

tc3nuu,"New here - advice? Hello - I've never had an HSV outbreak so if this is indeed what it is, it is my first, but after looking at photos I am not sure if this is HSV-1 or canker sores? My lower right lip was painful and swollen when I woke up on 3/1/21 and I'm now on day 11 of having what looks like possibly blisters? They are only on the more interior portion of my lower right lip, not on the edge of the lip like I see in most HSV-1 photos and not anywhere else on my lips, mouth, or face. They are incredibly painful to touch, have made it painful to eat, and sometimes hurt on their own without being touched. They don't tingle and I don't recall a tingling the day prior to symptoms. I've read they can burn, which the pain feels burn-y when I touch them but not on their own. The odd thing is that they seem to ebb and flow throughout the day with regards to the blisters being ""full"" (I don't know what other term to use), and they haven't broken or pussed or scabbed over. 

The 4 pictures are from varying times of the day over the last 3 days. From what I've read this 11 days seems longer than the blister stage usually lasts for HSV outbreaks? I've been with the same partner for 11 years but I'm aware that HSV can lurk around asymptomatically for a long time. Thanks for any advice.

A lot of places don’t test for HSV. A swab won’t look for HSV unless you ask OR have an active outbreak. Can you check what your levels were & let us know, thanks! ### Depending on your index level , Anything between 1.1 and 3.5 has a high chance of being false. The common test that they use are not very good and make a lot of mistakes. Causes people a lot of pain for no reason ### I had my first outbreak five months into my current relationship. I freaked and thought that he had maybe cheated on me or that he was going to think I cheated and leave me. My doctor says it was probably dormant and that it can happen to couples 20 years into marriage. She also said illnesses can cause the virus to activate if it’s dormant. I had Covid right before my first outbreak so it made a lot of sense. I cried A LOT. I told my mom first and we talked about how I should tell my bf. We’re long distance and he just happened to be coming to visit that weekend for my cousins wedding. I waited until after the wedding to tell him; if my relationship was going to end because of it, I wanted one last night where everything was normal. When I did tell him I cried for about a half hour before I could say anything. He had a lot of questions, he held me, and also needed a lot of reassurance that I hadn’t cheated. I was completely prepared for him to leave me. I told him it would be okay if he did, that I would understand. But it’s like the thought of that barely even crossed his mind. We’ve been together for almost two years now. He got tested and was negative and has remained negative. He gets tested about every 6ish months. It won’t be easy when you do tell him. It also won’t be easy after. It changed our relationship and our sex life was put on hold for a while. But he has been nothing but supportive and understanding the whole time. Being honest and open about it is best when it comes to partners. I hope it goes well for you when you tell him. ❤️ ### Hi, there. Please review our wiki page on herpes testing for a general overview on testing issues: [LINK](https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/wiki/herpes_testing).

> the nurse also said that it could not differentiate between HSV 1 and HSV 2 and i have had no symptoms. 

That means you were given a non-type-specific test, which was very irresponsible on the part of your clinician. More than half the population has oral hsv1, and so will test positive on a non-type-specific test even if they don't have genital herpes at all.

Furthermore, false-positives can also sometimes occur. The reliability of a positive IgG blood test result depends on the index value. Low values have the potential of being false positives. This is explained on the wiki page I linked above.

Also, you never said what kind of blood test you were given. There are a few clinicians out there who have outdated training who still administer IgM blood tests for herpes detection rather than IgG blood tests, even though IgM blood tests are completely unreliable for herpes detection. Nothing about a person's herpes status can be concluded from an IgM blood test, no matter whether the result is positive or negative -- they are completely unreliable. ### i’ve been seeing him since September and we’ve been exclusively only seeing each other since November. i have not had an outbreak i just got some blood work done and they told me HSV showed up, but did not give me a number or type. that is why i’m confused how this could have happened and i’m so scared to tell him bc of the stigma behind it and he is a very anxious hypertension person. we were both each others first for PIV inter course but i have given oral in the past and we have both kissed many people. i’ve gotten routine testing and they’ve all been negative until this last one. what should i do and how should i approach him with this? it’s his birthday and he’s away on a trip and we’re celebrating late when he’s back and i don’t want to have this convo over the phone so i’m just going to wait and not ruin his birthday. thank you! ### yes i will call back my doctor tomorrow and ask for my IGG levels and definitely let u know! also it was a blood test idk if that makes a difference? ### hey so i finally got my levels.

IgG is accurate which shows your negative. I would get another HSV igG in 12 weeks & if that comes back negative then your negative! ### Always be honest but, if you have low values like I said it’s a very good chance or false positive, they have something called a western blot , most insurances don’t cover it so you would have to pay out of pocket, it’s close to about $300 that will give you a concrete answer. Make sure you ask your doctor for your index levels that’s very important. Believe me I know it’s hard not to worry when you think something like that but try not to freak out too much until it’s confirmed for sure! And for future reference I wouldn’t take a regular IgG test ever again , because they are so unreliable get tested only if you have physical symptoms and can get a swab ### [removed] ### IGM is worthless in my opinion that , looks to me like you are negative you don’t have anything! I GM only test for  active infection, IgG looks for virus in your blood that is more important! But I don’t trust either one of them ### It’s definitely scary! I would advise being as knowledgeable about it as you can so you can answer questions he might have. Part of the stigma is the lack of education around HSV. It’s not as scary once you know the facts. Just remember that HSV does not make you any less deserving of love, connection, or respect! ### Condoms, daily antivirals, and knowing when you’re having outbreaks. I don’t believe there’s any way to know when you are asymptomaticly shedding the virus. I’ve only had it for about a year and a half so far. We are as careful as we can be, but he’s also accepted the fact that he could eventually get it. It’s just the risk that’s there when you have herpes and have a negative partner. There’s no guarantee they won’t get it. I was terrified of giving it to him as well, to the point where we didn’t have sex for MONTHS. I learned my body and did research about transmission and stuff until I felt comfortable enough to take that risk. He was ready to have sex much sooner than I was too. The first few times I even made him wear boxers with a condom on during sex, that way there always a decreased risk on skin on skin contact idk if it actually helped but it helped to comfort my mind. 🤷🏻‍♀️ ### It’s also safer to have sex with someone who knows their status. This way precautions can be taken and if need be sex can be postponed to a safer time. Think about if you never ever found out your status, you never have an outbreak. You would still have viral shedding and could still give it to him. At least now you can both be careful and knowledgeable. ### i’m getting another one today possibly bc it’s been a week and it’s suggested to wait 1-2 weeks to retest if my doctor says i should. thank u! ### i was reading about the western blot and if my levels are high i’m going to order it. thanks so much! ### Comment removed. Please do not post blind links. Include a brief summary of what the link is, or pertains to, and how it is relevant. ### ya i’ve been doing more research and i believe i would b negative by the looks of it but am going to discuss with the doctor tomorrow. also, the igm can mistaken mono (epstein barr) for herpes and i just had that recently (october-now). ### i’m having a hard time grasping that but thank u, guess it will come with time as i am young ### some questions. i am asymptomatic so are the antivirals still taken if i’ve never had an outbreak yet? or only once i start having outbreaks? i’m still awaiting confirmatory testing to be sure. also they couldn’t tell if it was HSV 1 or 2 from the test or the location of it. therefore, how can i safely perform oral because condoms taste gross or will i never be able to do that ever again? will my sex life change forever? i’m too afraid to give it to him so i don’t even want to have sex right now until i have answers and i don’t know if i will ever b the same again. ### You’re welcome for sure. I know exactly what your situation feels like , going to be tested with no symptoms just to do so ,and then results coming back positive with super low levels, with no information no idea of the high chance of it being false! Most doctors are not educated on this so it makes it harder on the person because they have to do all the research themselves when something like that should be provided for you ### It does haha I’m a 23F with GHSV2 if that helps comfort you. ### I’m unsure if you can take antivirals without having had an outbreak; that would definitely be a question to ask your doctor once you find out for sure. They do sell flavored condoms and lube that could be used during oral. You can definitely do it without, I’d just make sure there are no sores or cuts on/in the mouth/lips to help decrease the chance of it spreading. It’s also up to your partner and what they’re comfortable with. Your sex life will be different, but by no means does different=bad. You’ll just be more cautious and aware. I will admit that I miss the spontaneity and carefreeness of sex. Nothing like realizing you don’t have a condom in the heat of the moment to kill the mood 😂 I still have fun and amazing sex though so don’t worry about that!! Take it at your own pace, I’d definitely wait to have sex until you know for sure. But once you do (if you do have it) don’t be afraid to discuss things with your partner! Make sure they’re on the same page as you and you both understand how you’re each feeling. I also told my boyfriend when we started having sex again that I’d be more comfortable with it if he got tested every six months for it. Just so we can be aware of what might be going on! ### yes that’s simply what i could not understand. could not tell me HSV 1 or 1, couldn’t tell me the location, didn’t tell me the type of blood test or my levels, yet i have no symptoms and was not warned about false positives or confirmatory testing. seems unreal to me and my anxiety has never been this high and the nurse just down played it as if it was no big deal and to carry on with my life. ### thank u. i’m 20F and i don’t even know what type i have bc the nurse could not tell through the blood tests that’s stressful ### thanks so much! i’m refraining from everything until i find out my status and am trying to get him to get tested too. there’s so many statistics about asymptomatic shedding and the likeliness of it and everything is just so confusing and i don’t know what to believe and what’s accurate . ### It was the same exact thing for me. I’m the one that had to find out about the western blot myself and when I originally was trying to get the papers filled out for it, I was told what for you have this, “Join a support group for people who have it” like what? Let me make sure I have it first before you start trying to give me medication and telling me to join groups ### I’d advise writing down a list of ANY questions you have and or can think of. Then ask your doctor next time you go. It helps to write them out; I find I forget questions when I go in! ### They also probably have pamphlets and resources they could direct you to to read. ### exactly my standpoint too. this is all so messed up. i also ended up finding out this morning my igg levels and it was

I f/23 got these red spots out of nowhere on my pubic area next to my leg, like my groin, but both sides. It’s a couple red small dots and one big one.

Previously to that I was tested two times for IGG HSV2 both times index under 0.5, so negative.

So it could be genital HSV1, but both my parents have oral blisters so chances are high I already got that as a kid and up to 90% of population has it anyways, so probably me too. But maybe I didn’t get it and now I got it as genital HSV1

>I was just told I have H2 after having a vaginal outbreak. I can't stop crying and I'm waiting for my blood work to come back with other results please help me 

Were you swab tested?

If visible symptoms are present then the priority should always be swab testing over blood testing (unless the symptoms are deemed to be unsuitable for swabbing, eg very minor, mostly healed, etc). This is *especially* true if there's any possibility the symptoms could be hsv1. Blood testing can be done as *well*, but the priority should be swabbing. This is for several reasons:

1. A blood test cannot detect a brand new herpes infection. Blood tests work by detecting herpes antibodies, which the body starts creating after becoming infected. But it can take anywhere from several weeks to several months before a person will have generated a sufficient volume of antibodies to be detectable on a blood test. This is discussed on our wiki page on herpes testing: [LINK](https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/wiki/herpes_testing). Meanwhile, if visible symptoms are present then they can be swab tested immediately -- there is no waiting period.

2. A blood test cannot specify the location of a herpes infection, or confirm that specific symptoms are herpes. This is especially problematic in cases where people experience ambiguous genital symptoms -- because more than half the population has oral hsv1 (and a full 70% of these people don't know they have it) and so these people will test positive for hsv1 even if it has nothing to do with their genital symptoms. These people may mistakenly conclude that their positive blood test results means that their genital symptoms are hsv1 when they aren't, and when they may not have a genital herpes infection at all. Meanwhile, a swab test will test the specific location that was swabbed.

3. Standard IgG blood tests aren't that good at detecting hsv1 in general. Even after the 12 week waiting period they still miss a full 30% of hsv1 infections. Fortunately, they are better at detecting hsv2 and will only miss 8% of hsv2 infections at 12 weeks and beyond.

Note that there are two different kinds of swab tests available for herpes testing: viral culture and PCR. PCR is newer and is *much* more sensitive than viral culture. Viral culture can be fine when symptoms are pronounced, and in blister like form, or the sort of classic cold-sore-type blister that herpes is known for, and especially if liquid can be readily extracted from the blister/lesion/ulcer. But when symptoms are less pronounced, or not in obvious blister form, then PCR is the way to go if at all possible.

Note also that PCR swabs are less widely available than viral culture swabs. So if you want to get a PCR swab done then call your doctor in advance and ask whether they offer them. If they don't then try calling some other local providers. (and if a provider that you call doesn't offer them, ask the provider if they're aware of any other local providers that *do*, etc). ### I had all the systems went to the doctor she looked at my blisters and instantly knew what it was. I went and did blood work today. I'm just so scared of what else they may find. I'm trying to keep my cool but this is soo hard on me. It's really hard accepting this but im trying my best ### You didn't answer my question. ### I did...no swap just blood work.

Those are both *very* low positives. Statistically, they are considerably more likely than not to be false positives -- especially if you're talking about hsv2.

According to herpes expert Terri Warren, an hsv2 index value of 1.3 statistically has about an 85% of being a false positive. Eg here's a post on her clinic forum where a client asked:

>I have had cold sores so the NP I see for my annuals tested only for HSV2 the igg level was 1.3. She called me and said that I had genital herpes. I have never had any symptoms or outbreaks. Is there a chance this is a false positive?

And Terri replied:

>There is definitely an excellent chance that this is a false positive, there is an 85% chance this is a false positive in fact.

([Source](https://www.westoverheights.com/forum/question/confusing-results-help/))

Meanwhile your value of 1.2 has probably closer to a 90% chance of being a false positive.  Here are some quotes from Terri regarding an index value of 1.22:

>Your HSV 2 (index value of 1.22) is technically positive, but there is probably a 90% chance that this is a false positive.

([Source](https://westoverheights.com/forum/question/what-does-this-mean/)

and

>Are you saying that your HSV 2 index value was 1.22? That is an incredibly low positive, just barely over the cutoff ... At 1.22, there is a 90% chance that this is a false positive

([Source](https://westoverheights.com/forum/question/hsv2-14/))

And your value of 1.2 was very slightly lower than that. The lower the value, the greater the likelihood of being a false positive. ### ",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tbzpgv/test_results_and_how_to_proceed_need_advice/

No matter whether a person has genital hsv1 or genital hsv2, the risk of genital-to-oral transmission is very low so long as no outbreak is present.

Genital hsv1 poses a very low risk of genital-to-oral transmission outside of an active outbreak because genital hsv1 is one of the least active kinds of herpes there is. It very rarely sheds asymptomatically (ie very rarely becomes active on the skin surface without causing actual visible symptoms). Then add to that the fact that the vast majority of exposures to asymptomatic shedding don't result in transmission *anyway*, and you can see the risk is very low. Genital hsv1 poses a very low risk of genital-to-*genital* transmission outside of active outbreaks for the same reason.

Genital hsv2, meanwhile, asymptomatically sheds considerably more frequently than genital hsv1. But hsv2 has a very strong preference for the genital region. Even when it is given the opportunity to infect orally it usually doesn't bother.

- 80% of people are asymptomatic. That combined with the fact that herpes isn’t on standard STD panels means that the vast majority of people who have it don’t even know that they have it.

It's great for the average outbreak here and there. But if you take it constantly then your body will come to rely on it, and if you ever stop taking it you'll have an outbreak.

Lysine is an amino acid, so if you eat more red meat you'll get more of it naturally in your system without needing an L diversion. So I'd recommend taking some for assisting with suppression here and there. Otherwise, more red meat, more milk, and shower/laundry regularly.

If you're having very regular outbreaks consider an anti-viral suppressant. ### Yes and zinc !! ### I’ve been taking it for months , as an immune booster ( wasn’t aware that our bodies can get used to it?!) also a once daily maintenance dose of valaclcyclear ### Should you take both ? I started the lysine before the red marine algae but I was told if your body gets used to the lysine and you stop it can cause OBS ### ",5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tblj7z/is_llysine_good_for_daily_intake_for_genital/
tbckua,"Disclosing today? 😬 So I’m considering disclosing to a guy tonight via text. He’s really great so far and I need to tell him before things go any further and before I get too attached.

Does anyone have any last minute tips or recommendations for me? Anything I should add in or leave out? I have GHSV2 btw.",28,2022-03-10 18:46:47-05:00,"Leave out any fear. The more confident you are in your stats, understanding of transmission & your value then the better they get it’s just a skin condition ### Come back and tell us how it goes!! Good luck ! ### Just be confident and tell him how it is. Being honest is more important than anything. I was lied to or they didn’t know. You know and you care. If he doesn’t understand or respect that then gtfo. ### I think that you’ve been brave to say it via text 😊and if he will keep it for himself then he is a good one ### How will you disclose to him? And which strain do you have? ### Good luck !! ### I sent it. They responded but I’m scared to open. I put my phone on do not disturb bc I’m nervous lmao ### Yeah, I had this anxiety too the first time I disclosed. The conclusion I came to is this: if I tell her face-to-face and request that she keep it private and for whatever reason she doesn't respect that, then she is going to go and tell her friends/family/whoever her version of events. If she is emotionally charged/turned off/scared then it's likely she's going to give a narrative of disclosure that doesn't necessarily reflect how the conversation really happened. So those people get a one sided view of me and my diagnosis, probably without any of the info about hsv and its transmission risk. On the other hand, if I send a carefully crafted text that I know has had success in the past, and I know is honest, calm, informative and transparent (and asks her to keep it private), and she shares this text directly with her friends/family... at the very least it educates people about the facts of hsv and my situation. It may even get those people thinking ""why has she broken his trust and sent me this?""; it might show their true colours.

Either way my privacy has been compromised which is crap, but I think the latter is a bit better. ### check out my comments below :) ### Omg I literally did this last night to a guy . But open it he may have important questions ### What he say ### Can I ask how did you word your text? :) ### Lol isn’t it funny how we have such visceral reactions with stuff like this? I disclosed to a guy via text a few months ago and my heart was beating so fast. I looked at my heart rate on the Fitbit app and there was a comically sharp spike during the time I texted and waited for a response. ### How did you disclose, like your phrase? ### omg omg omg he said “I’m cool with it under one condition.” Of course now I’m waiting to see what the condition is 🥴🥴🥴 ### Imma be upfront with ya real quick bc sexual health is important to meeee. So remember how I told you I was cheated on? The way I found out is because I ended up with HSV2. I got it from my first boyfriend who had cheated on me. I know there is a HUGE stigma around this, so I’m sure you may have questions or be turned off. I just wanted to let you know all the facts up front since I like you and wanted to see if this was a dealbreaker before I go any further. Before you make any assumptions or decisions, just inform yourself on it and go from there. Also, no pressure to respond now so take your time lol

I think of it as a skin condition because that’s simply what it is. It doesn’t affect my life in any way at all and it’s not the end of the world. I honestly forget I have it because it doesn’t affect me. I am absolutely responsible so I always use condoms and I take a daily antiviral that suppresses the HSV and reduces transmission to about 1% per year. So that means if I use condoms and take a suppressive antiviral every single day, there’s about a 1% chance I could give it to someone. I still do alllll things sexually. I’ve only had one outbreak ever and that was when I first found out. Some people only ever have one outbreak and never have them again. That’s been the case for me so far. It’s more common than we think bc it isn’t included on typical sti panels and some people are just asymptomatic. This is a lot of info and I am open to any types of questions, just be respectful. Lmk if you want me to send you some other info about it. ### Ok what he say now ### OP, this is a fantastic example of how to disclose. I send very similar texts when I disclose and have yet to be rejected. Congrats on your positive disclosure (excuse the pun)! ### He said “I’m cool with it under one condition.” I said “what is it?” and he said “lemme see them tiddies” omg ### I've had mixed results when I've disclosed but little stories like these always make me feel more positive.

Zero. That contact was too limited to pose any practical risk for genital herpes transission.

tbs2a5,"What Would You Do? First off-  thank you to this community.  First post but this place has been a incredibly helpful resource.

Background-  November 2021 I came back positive (1.74,  IgG test) for HSVII on a routine 10 panel test.   I had not had an outbreak and the result floored me.  After reading this board, I decided to go through with a Western Blot and to my relief, received a negative result.  

Early March 2022, I had what appeared to be some kind of flair up with multiple, clustered pimple like bumps on my private parts.  I don't think these were razor burn and they have mostly faded away at this point.  These showed up about two weeks following the last time I regrettably had unprotected sex (mid February 2022) with someone I don't know very well.  I freaked out and assumed I'd definitely caught something.  

Two days ago I went and did another routine 10 panel test, expecting the worst.  While I still came back positive for HSVII, my result (1.22) had actually decreased from the previous time I had tested which a Western Blot had ruled a false positive.

If you were me, what would you do?  I'd rather not go through the costly process of another Western Blot.

Lidocaine creams/gels can often provide substantial relief by numbing the area. You can often get these over the counter at the pharmacy without a prescription.

You could try calling your local pharmacy in advance and asking ""hi, do you sell any lidocaine creams or gels that are suitable for the genital area? etc"" That way you can find out what to ask for in advance when you go in and it might save you from an awkward conversation in the pharmacy with other people potentially around.

If ur worried about spreading ghsv to oral region, it's usually unlikely that happens

I'm bi but think I'll just stick to males as I feel like it's easier to go about hsv with them idk ### Do you have ghsv1 or 2 ? ### I think the best thing you can do is to be on 800mg/1g a day of antivirals depending on the brand and just making sure you're all clear right before hand. ### I've only been with one woman since I've been diagnosed with ghsv1. In my experience,  she had a fear of contracting it from me. I started taking antivirals when we decided we were going to be intimate. With fingering, we used gloves, she would not perform oral on me,  and she would grind on my leg while I kept my underwear on as she fingered me with the glove on.  I know this isn't exactly what you asked but those are some ideas for alternatives if either of you are worried.  From what I understand, ghsv1 has a low transmission rate but there is always a risk. Just do what you both feel comfortable with and have fun! ### With regards to spreading , from what i’ve read ghsv1 less OB / viral shedding so that’s good. About 70 % of population already has hsv1 in one location or another so as long as they have had it a few months the risk  of infecting another location is minimal .

On a neg side women due to nature of mucus areas of genitals are more at risk than males in general. 

Best thing to do is ask the person if they have ever had any oral  cold sores / fever blisters as a kid, and they could get tested as a lot of people are quite surprised that they are one of many asymptomatic hsv positive people that assumed they are negative due to not ever having and OB & never having been tested for herpes

Add to it the antivirals & being aware of any changes & tingles you may have that could indicate an OB is on the way ### I have ghsv-1 female here but i wnna experience with a girl what are the chances? ### That’s what I’m currently taking 👍🏼 ### That is much higher precaution than people would typically engage in for ghsv1. ### How olds re you ### I personally didn't love it but as I said, she was super afraid to get it so that's what we did.

Anyway,  there's also not a ton of info out there for woman on woman sex in regards to a herpes diagnosis so I did what could make her feel safe.  Even if it is a much higher precaution I think it's helpful to share alternatives for people who are in a similar situation. ### Im 21 ### >I personally didn't love it but as I said, she was super afraid to get it so that's what we did. To be honest, there were a few times where she made me feel shitty about it. Needless to say, we didn't last very long.

I'm sorry, that sounds like a fairly unsatisfying experience.

In situations like that, it can be useful to explain to your partner that just how low a risk genital hsv1 actually poses. Partners are actually considerably *safer* with you, ie considerably *less* likely to catch genital hsv1 or oral hsv1 from you and your genital hsv1 infection than they are with a partner who has *oral* hsv1 -- which more than half of all their past partners had and half of all their prospective partners will have.

Genital hsv1 is one of the least active kinds of herpes there is. It poses a *very* low -- some might say *extremely* low -- risk of transmission when no outbreak is present. Almost all cases of genital hsv1 are the result of receiving oral sex from a partner who has oral hsv1. Genital-to-genital hsv1 transmission, or genital-to-oral hsv1 transmission, outside of an active outbreak, is a very rare thing.

Basically, if your partners have no issues having sex with people with oral hsv1 infections, or people of unknown status (who have at least a 50% chance of having oral hsv1), they should have no issue having sex with you since you would pose considerably *less* risk for them catching oral hsv1 or genital hsv1. If they do, it's a result of irrational anxiety and/or not understanding the situation.

Here are two past comments regarding hsv1 that you might also find helpful:

tbp6b2,"Acute & extremely unpleasant Herpes Oral Outbreak Hello redditors! First off, I want to say that all of you are awesome and I'm greatly thankful to have come across this subreddit. I have GHSV-2, tested and confirmed back in 2018, and I've told no one in my life about it. It feels great to be in this community and for once I don't feel isolated with my constant outbreak battles. 

Ok, let's get this moving. In 2019, I started having oral outbreaks. It wasn't as frequent as my genital outbreaks. However, the severity is just out the park compared to it. 

I get very painful ulcers inside my mouth, on my tongue, on my gum and even the lining of my gum swells (somewhere between 10 - 15 ulcers at its peak). My upper and lower lips will swell with 4-6 big ulcers as well. The pain is unbearable even after taking painkillers and I usually have to go on a liquid diet for the first week. It usually clears itself in 10-14 days.

Over the years I'm able to pick up the signs of an upcoming outbreak, which usually I can manage to safely avoid by taking antiviral medications. I'm having a similar outbreak now and I've attached a photo of just my lower lip (I did not take any photos of my past oral outbreaks because it reminds me of a nasty gruesome experience). My current outbreak is far less severe with just 3 ulcers inside my mouth & 1 on my upper lip.

I've been reading a lot of your experiences and never have I came across anything like mine. Hopefully I will be able to find out what type of HSV am I dealing with here.

What type of side effects did experience from the medication?",12,2022-03-11 00:52:23-05:00,">Anyone Taking Antivirals Purely for Reducing Transmission? (Particularly if your asymptomatic?)

You didn't say which kind of herpes you're talking about but many people who have genital hsv2 take suppressive medication to reduce transmission risk to partners even if they don't get outbreaks. Even if they don't get outbreaks it is still highly likely that they will periodically shed virus asymptomatically. And suppressive medication reduces asymptomatic transmission risk by about 50%.

Meanwhile, suppressive medication is not recommended for typical cases of genital hsv1 because the risk of asymptomatic transmission is already so low even without medication. (Genital hsv1 is one of the least active kinds of herpes there is). ### I just use NEEM oil before and after and make sure my partner cleans ### I only take anti virals when I have an outbreak, but if I were to start taking them as a suppressive or preventative what are the stars for reducing transmission? ### May I ask how do you use it?

You didn't say what kind of herpes you're talking about. Here are the transmission stats for genital hsv2:

---

**Male-to-Female Ghsv2 transmission risk:**

In studies of couples in long term relationships (ie together at least 3 months already) where the man has genital hsv2 and the woman doesn't and they both know he has it, if they have *unprotected* sex for an entire year (approximately twice per week) except during outbreaks, and the man takes no herpes medication, the woman has about a 10% chance of becoming infected by the end of the year.

Having sex more or less often than twice per week would raise or lower that base figure accordingly. Also note that that base figure comes from studies of couples already in long term relationships, and herpes is slightly more likely to transmit when the partners have been together less than 3 months. We aren't sure exactly *how* much higher the risk is before the 3-month mark, but we know its definitely higher. We also know that herpes is more active when the infection is recent, eg during the first 6-12 months of having it (the decline is gradual).

If the man takes daily herpes medication that would lower the risk to the woman by about 50%, bringing the annual risk from about 10% down to about 5%. Furthermore, condoms have been found to provide women with a very high level of protection from herpes, though not quite complete. One recent large scale study found that condoms reduce male-to-female herpes transmission risk by a further 96%. Herpes expert Terri Warren thinks that might be a *bit* on the high side, but not by much. So consider well over a further 90% reduction. So without condoms or medication, the annual risk to the woman is about 10%. With medication it falls to about 5%. With condoms but no medication it would be about 1%. And with medication *and* condoms it's well under 1%. 

**Female-to-Male Ghsv2 transmission risk:**

If the situation is reversed and it's the woman who has genital hsv2 and the man doesn't and they both know she has it, if they have unprotected sex for an entire year (approximately twice per week) except during outbreaks and the woman takes no herpes medication, the man has a 4% chance of becoming infected by the end of the year.

To reiterate: having sex more or less often than twice per week would raise or lower that base figure accordingly. And that base figure comes from studies of couples already in long term relationships, and herpes is slightly more likely to transmit when the partners have been together less than 3 months, or when the infection is still fairly recent (eg first six months etc).

Condom use and herpes medication would each lower the female-to-male transmission risk by about 50% further from whatever it was before. So if the couple uses condoms *or* the woman takes medication, the annual risk to the man comes down to about 2%. And if they use both, it comes down to about 1%. As you can see, men are at considerably less risk of catching herpes than women when no condoms are used. But men also gain considerably less protection from condoms than do women.

---

The risk posed by genital hsv1 is considerably lower, and suppressive medication is not recommended for typical case of ghsv1 because the level of risk is already so low without them. ### In HSV2 I think they halve the transmission rate. ### Whole foods or sprouts or amazon ### Do you have any info. regarding ghsv1 to oral transmission? i’m female. i’m wondering if a partner would get ohsv1 giving me oral sex? ### No matter whether a person has genital hsv1 or genital hsv2, the risk of genital-to-oral transmission is very low so long as no outbreak is present.

Genital hsv1 poses a very low risk of genital-to-oral transmission outside of an active outbreak because genital hsv1 is one of the least active kinds of herpes there is. It very rarely sheds asymptomatically (ie very rarely becomes active on the skin surface without causing actual visible symptoms). Then add to that the fact that the vast majority of exposures to asymptomatic shedding don't result in transmission *anyway*, and you can see the risk is very low. Genital hsv1 poses a very low risk of genital-to-*genital* transmission outside of active outbreaks for the same reason.

Genital hsv2, meanwhile, asymptomatically sheds considerably more frequently than genital hsv1. But hsv2 has a very strong preference for the genital region. Even when it is given the opportunity to infect orally it usually doesn't bother. Oral hsv2 is fairly uncommon. ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tbj88b/anyone_taking_antivirals_purely_for_reducing/
tbizrk,"1st OB in a few years, are flu/cold symptoms normal? hey everyone, throwaway account. Have a few questions and was wondering if anyone can share their thoughts or if anyone has experienced anything similar? 

I received my GHSV1 diagnosis in 2019 and had really bad flu symptoms and a large amount sores. I had a couple of minor OBs after and it's probably been at least 1.5 years since my last OB. I think I am having an OB right now but I'm not 100% sure. That's what I'm hoping to get some advice on.

It started out with an extreme itch on sunday in the groin area and I made the mistake of scratching it :( and forgot about it for a few days. For the past 3-4 days I have been having flu symptoms. I actually thought it was COVID but tested negative with both antigen and PCR. I only now noticed some bumps forming where I scratched a few days ago.. they aren't open sores or anything yet that's why I'm not sure if it's an OB. 

It was only then I realized I'm probably having an outbreak but is it normal to have flu symptoms again? I thought that was common only for the 1st outbreak? I haven't refilled my Valtrex prescription in awhile and the expiry date is conveniently smudged off the bottle but I took 1 anyways.

Anyone else get flu-like symptoms from recurring outbreaks? Can itching trigger a full on OB? Is there anything I can do to make this go away faster? The timing sucks because I was supposed to see my partner next week after months of long distance. Any help/thoughts would be appreciated. thanks!",0,2022-03-11 00:37:27-05:00,,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tbizrk/1st_ob_in_a_few_years_are_flucold_symptoms_normal/

Good luck ### [deleted] ### Male to female, never used a condom because my outbreaks aren’t on my shaft anyways ### Just to make you aware, Terri Warren says it doesn't matter where your outbreaks are - if they're in the genital region the same general nerve ganglion below the skin is infected. Shedding most often occurs where the skin is thinnest - most commonly the shaft of the penis but also the perineum and the anus. Its not common to experience prodromal symptoms on the scrotum or to shed on the scrotum, where the skin is thicker. 

Even if symptoms aren't present, you can shed anywhere in that general area, so even if you don't have outbreaks on your shaft or if you experience prodomal symptoms on an area thats not your penis, you could still be shedding on the shaft and should wear a condom. Especially as the shaft is the most infectious area.

taz64e,"28 F vaginal herpes My boyfriend 27 M and I have been dating a month. I told him to get an STD test before we dated and I would too. We both tested negative. Well, now I have vaginal herpes for the rest of my life. The pain, look and smell is debilitating. I asked to physically see his test results. He got tested for everything but herpes. I am finding out many places and clinics don’t include herpes in their tests. Or at least this shit free clinic doesn’t because CDC says not to. Fucking idiots. He feels awful and I understand it was an accident but I feel so broken and depressed right now. I’m angry and sad and he just wants me to “stay positive.”

I don’t want to leave him. We love each other and have a history. But right now it’s hard to look at him and not feel completely miserable.

How do you forgive?",53,2022-03-10 08:54:23-05:00,"He might not have been the one to give it to you. Herpes can lay dormant for months and sometimes years. Maybe his bacteria triggered your outbreak. But if this is a new outbreak and he is the one that gave it to you, maybe he is still shedding the virus. It would be worth getting tested just to get a definite answer. ### Doesn’t need to be a shit clinic to not test for HSV. I’m a patient of scripps one of the best hospitals in San Diego and they don’t test either. Unless you ask because of CDC guidelines. Found out recently that Iv had this for 5 years and my fist break out was this year. If he truly didn’t know or even didn’t give it to you, then you will learn to forgive. My experience has humbled me a lot and I’m a very jaded person because of what Iv experienced in life. ### [deleted] ### - Go back, request specific testing for HSV. If you catch resistance from any doctors/nurses, INSIST. Not only will knowing which HSV(1 or 2) both you and your boyfriend have provide clarification, you should also know the specifics of your condition. 

- Reading others comments, I don’t want you to get lost or overwhelmed by people yelling yes this is fact or no that’s not true on xyz regarding HSV. When it comes to seeking advice for HSV, I cannot stress enough to take everything that is given to you by anyone on any platform who is not a doctor or specialist, with a grain of salt. HSV is elusive, nuanced….difficult. Every single physical body is different. When it comes to symptoms of HSV + a female body - think about the vast amount of variables you have going on here; even without HSV, vaginas differ so greatly from one to the other:

• your normal PH level
• your normal amount of yeast
• your normal amount of discharge
• where you are at in your monthly cycle
• the birth control you might be on
• any other underlying conditions
• how hydrated you are
• have you consumed anything that could offset the balance of your vagina and/or trigger an outbreak(caffeine, sugar, alcohol are my triggers; some people can eat and drink whatever they want and have no issue)

Add all of that to an outbreak and YES maybe it does cause an odor. YES maybe it does cause an irregular amount of discharge. YES maybe it does cause an irregularly colored discharge. YES an outbreak could cause a yeast infection. FOR YOU. 


Do not be afraid to go to the doctor in the middle of an outbreak and ask is this all normal for an outbreak? You’ll get an exam. You’ll get a panel test done. You’ll know what is normal for YOU. You will learn to listen and pay attention to your body and your body’s chemistry. The advice people give you might be true for them but do not hold it as fact when comparing it to yourself. 


- when it comes to living with HSV….it’s easy peasy. Granted it took me a year+ to get over it as a life hurdle. It might take you a longer or shorter amount of time. However, I found that accepting that this is now a fact of life for me and that it cannot be changed is what helped me accept myself and forgive the person who gave it to me. So harboring/internalizing any negative or disciplinary emotion such as guilt, shame, anger, resentment etc. was futile. It was exhausting. Feel your emotions fully and then let them go. You are allowed to be angry, cry, take time away from your partner whether temporarily or permanently. I hardly use these HSV forums for advice. I mostly use them for support. 


Good luck :-) ### well atleast you got it from someone you love. imagine have a 5 min one night stand that wasnt even enjoyable and now your dick looks like a flower

i dont know if ill date again for a while ### Which strain are you positive for , ghsv1
or ghsv2. ?  And problem with igg antibody blood tests is sometimes they are not accurate. Hsv 1 has a false negative rate if 30 % & hsv2 8%. So someone might also test and their test can come back negative and they are actually positive.    Understand in your BF case they didn’t test which is more the norm across the world not the exception .  Most places swab OB only unless requested & even then a lot of places just won’t do it due to the fact that they do not considerate accurate . ### I'm confused. How do you know be gave it to you? You said they didn't test for it. Did you test for it? Did you get it swabbed? I've never known herpes to smell like you said...I'm jw. ### I know now it will feel like the end of the world. Getting herpes is something no one plans for in life, and you think you’ll do everything you can to avoid catching an STD that’s with you for life. I remember feeling so deflated and isolated when I found out. I’d been with my boyfriend for approx. 3 months when I got blisters which at the time I thought were ingrown hairs from shaving. After the third time it happened and a serious case of flu like symptoms I accepted it couldn’t be ingrown hairs. I was devastated and felt ‘dirty’. It’s likely my bf gave it to me (he seems to be a carrier of things lol) as it cropped up alongside HPV when I started sleeping with him unprotected. But I can’t guarantee because I’ve never really used protection with long-term partners. 

I digress. My point is that it’ll feel emotionally sore for a while whilst you come to terms with your diagnosis. A year on and I don’t even think about it. It’s a pain in the butt when I have an outbreak, just because it’s physically uncomfortable, but I don’t sweat it. Millions of people have herpes, oral and genital and life just goes on. It isn’t a death sentence, you can live super healthy and happy and it’ll reduce the chances of an outbreak. Medications and creams are great too. You’ll also find lots of support on this sub from people going through what you’re going through. (28F for context, feel free to PM if you want someone to talk to) ### . ### No need for forgiveness because it wasnt his fault… also herpes can stay dormant a long time and triggered by stress. Tbh when i had herpes i was also depressed but now im free as a button. You like him and he like’syou. Keep dating and both of you are positives now anyway. You could have gotten it through a guy you dont like. Or a toilet seat… lol ### Me and my gf picked it up in a threesome, both showed signs for it within 48 hrs of each other after encountering it, although it was really traumatizing at the time, 2 years later we just laugh about it now because literally everyone has if and the other half just doesnt know they do yet ### I got genital hsv1 from my boyfriend who has cold sores. I never knew it was a thing until I got tested. He feels guilty, a part of me resents him for it but it’s also on me. Neither one of us is at fault imo we were both uneducated now we both live with it in different ways. I would just have a conversation about it if you both love each other you can work past it. ### Time heals everything. You’re still alive and have a loving relationship. Why focus on the negative? ### Wait so I can have Herpes, test negative for it because it’s dormant, and then test positive for it later? ### That’s not why they don’t test for it. 

The test isn’t included because we know that as much as 86% of the adult public has HSV1 (conservative estimates suggest 70%) and no standard blood test can distinguish whether your antibodies protect against HSV1 or HSV2. 

Nearly everyone would test positive for HSV1–it’s incredibly common.

The only way to conclusively test for HSV2 is by swabbing an active lesion. 

So there is no medical indication for running a blood test—as it would never let someone know if they were positive for HSV2. No useful information is obtained from including a test for HSV antibodies on an STI panel. ### Love you. ### I understand the feeling. I think about the future and if we will break up - where does that leave me in the dating world? It’s scary and depressing. ### damn i felt that. prob 3 mins max idek his name and i was nearly blacked out drunk now my cute lil vag is scar ridden and has herpes for life LMAO ### Ya I tested for it. Came back negative before we were intimate. On top of blisters and sores, there is a cum like discharge and a fishy smell. Awful. ### Same thing happened with me! ### It’s more likely that it wasn’t included in your testing panel (like it wasn’t for your BF) since you have to often request it specifically. So you could have had it (and would show positive if tested for it) since before you met him ### Yes absolutely. ### I’m also curious about this?🤔 never heard of this before ### I… don’t think you’d test negative bc it’s dormant… I think after a (3-6?) month period of having herpes in your body, your body creates antibodies which would show up on a blood test. So if you do a herpes blood test and it comes back positive, you have already had it for a certain amount of time. If blood test comes back negative but a swab comes back positive, this usually indicates new infection as the swab takes the sores fluids ans tests that, where your body hasn’t had time to create enough antibodies to show a positive blood test result yet. ### So my blood test igg say positive hsv2 antibodies 6.48range . R u saying it could be Hsv1 Because on the results Hsv1 was negative. I'm so confused the igg test doesn't distinguish the 2? ### [deleted] ### You’ll be fine. I’ve dated extensively with herpes and had very little pushback upon disclosure. Like… a LOT of disclosure conversations in my life. ### That part definitely isn't herpes. At least the smell isn't. Discharge probably isn't either. Sounds like you might have BV as well. I'm almost certain herpes doesn't produce a discharge or strong smell. You def should get that part checked. I've had it for 10 years and have researched almost everything. Sorry you gotta deal with this. First one is worse. ### That might be gonorrhea. I know I’ve had it. It has all the symptoms of herpes and the distinguishing factor is the discharge I thought? Endless you rested it and they said herpes but yea I’ve read the discharge is usually the distinction between herpes and gonorrhea that’s how my doctor die tied it ### Herpes causes Bv infection I was jus diagnosed with that after Hsv diagnosis the cum discharge is all gone now after 5 day treatment I believe. ### Did your bf come back positive? He really might not have been the one to give it to you. ### No I did get a negative test ### you're probably correct in this scenario, but you can test negative after being positive. i had HSV1 as a kid and test negative for it now. i have antibodies but they are too low to register i think. also, im pretty sure blood tests are accurate after about 12 days but a few weeks is a safer bet. ### The IgG distinguishes more clearly between the two than the IgM but my understanding is that it has high false negative rates and other substantial problems.

I also think that this isn’t the test that most labs issue, when they issue a blood test at all—because the cost associated with an IgG is quite high and the wait time on results is long-ish.

The disparity in your antibody counts does make it sound (to me) like your results are likely conclusive. ### Right—I think the issue with the WB is price and testing locations? In the US the Western Blot Assay is conducted exclusively at the University of Washington and all samples have to be sent to the university for testing. From the whole country—idk if this is a different situation in other countries. Each test costs a minimum of $10 USD and most cost $40. 

Labs straight up will not give you the option of a WB test for HSV in Canada. The public health system won’t pay for it and you can’t insist on it—the “customer” is not always right in Canadian healthcare.

The option for routine WB testing for HSV is in its infancy, in terms of public access—it’s been used conclusively for research purposes, but not in public health contexts. 

At least that’s my understanding of it. ### Increased discharge IS a symptom, I had it myself the first outbreak. I had so much I thought my partner had cum inside me the night before. I read online and it said it could be herpes as well because it’s an infection. ### I googled herpes discharge and it seems to align with my situation but who knows..how do I test for bv? ### He’s getting a test today ### Virtually no STI tests include a test for any form of herpes—HSV1 or HSV2—because there is no conclusive test that distinguishes which you have from a blood or urine test as the test only detects whether you have antibodies against them. 

This isn’t because of the CDC, nor is it because the clinic is stupid. 

It’s because, unless your active lesions are swabbed, the test won’t determine if you have HSV2. 

If your boyfriend had never had active lesions, he would likely never have been tested. 

And the same applies to you—or to anyone. 

Most people are never tested for herpes as it isn’t included in any of the tests for STIs. ### Specifically for HSV? ### granted I was in Puerto Rico at the time, and subject to their available labs, but I literally had a cold sore on my lip, and tested negative for HSV-1 and HSV-2 on the exact same day. (IGG Blood test). 

i tested positive for HSV1 20 years prior. 

Bewildering. ### I was curious about this. So the antibodies can reduce down after so long of having it that you’d test negative? I want to get tested but can’t figure out who will let me because planned parenthood is telling me they won’t unless I have symptoms because of the rate of inaccuracies. I’m convinced I got it as a kid as well. So because it’s been so long and no speculations since I was young I could test negative? Also I am currently getting std testing and the nurse practitioner at planned parenthood said blood tests are really inaccurate too. I’m so confused cause I hear so many different things but I guess that’s mostly on the internet 😭 ### In canada can you choose to pay for a test? I get pain down there but no lesions. My doc did a swab found nothing because there’s no lesion. But refuses to give me any other kind of test. I get a strong feeling that he thinks that I’d be better off not knowing. I really do. Said things like well it could be but I don’t think it is, herpes is just cold sores. And he sees nothing that would indicate anything contagious. But honestly something is wrong when I get three days of no pain every 2-3 weeks. It’s like a form of torture. I don’t care about pain but I do care about giving it to a partner. And that pain is just a reminder that I could give it to somebody and they have a worse reaction. Think I got a bj from somebody with a cold sore. ### Yeah,  I already corrected my comment. ### A doctor. Idk, I've just seen so many people say that a fishy smell is not herpes. ### I see what you're finding in your search.  I was under the impression that herpes def didn't smell like fish... but maybe? No one I know has said that but Google says otherwise lol. ### OBGYN/doctor will test ### thats what it seems like! honestly if its HSV1 and you've had no symptoms since you were a kid, I'd say fuck it. all my friends had to get tested bc of me and turns out one of them has HSV1. she told her husband and he was like...""I get cold sores"" lol he didn't know it was a thing. I also never knew I had to disclose HSV1 until I had HSV2. 70% of people already have it. 

if you think it's HSV2, I'd lie and say a partner came down with symptoms if they refused. ### Uhh. Your doctor sounds wildly misinformed. This is unfortunately common—many doctors are not well educated about STIs and don’t keep on top of reading the latest medical literature.

Herpes is not just cold sores, it causes lesions on the genitals. Many people, mainly women, who are positive for GHSV1 and GHSV2 report feeling the “tingling” or “numb” uncomfortable sensation on their genitals that often accompanies lesions without necessarily seeing the lesion appear on the skin—the virus lives in the nerve ganglion beneath the skin and when the nerve is activated it can cause discomfort or in most cases the tingly sensation even if a lesion doesn’t occur. 

Also, even if you don’t have lesions, the virus sheds when they are not there. While active lesions do shed the most, you still shed the virus cyclically even when asymptomatic. 

I couldn’t tell you if this is or isn’t herpes. What I can say is that you should either ask your doctor for a full panel STI test, both urine and blood, and also ask for them to include the test that is free (in Canada, at least) which is nonspecific and will indicate whether you have either variety of HSV. 

If you can’t get them to issue you a requisition for that test, or, if that test is positive, you can ask for a requisition for the test that you have to pay for out of pocket which would tell you (with relatively high risk of a false negative—still better than not knowing anything!) whether it might be HSV1 or HSV2. 

You might have to ask the techs at a lab nearest to you which test they do for this, so you can tell your doctor the specific test to requisition as they don’t order these often when patients have to pay out of pocket. 

If your doctor won’t order either of these tests, I recommend using the strategy of saying “please make a note in my chart that I am experiencing regular discomfort in my genital area, and a note of which tests you are declining to order and why.” The “please note my symptoms and why you are declining to test for their source” line can help get testing for symptoms you’re concerned about in many cases with doctors. 

If your doctor really won’t budge on any of these—see if there is a sexual health clinic near you. There are some clinics in most major cities and even in some mid-size towns that offer sexual healthcare without referrals from a family doctor, and they might be able to order a test. 

The last thing I’d point out is that even if this isn’t herpes—discomfort every few weeks in your genitals sounds uncomfortable and miserable to put up with, and you definitely deserve good care for it! Not just for any future partner’s sake, but for yours. It’s not normal to be in pain like that, and even if it isn’t STI related, it could be neurological, related to a UTI, or something else, and some investigation seems important. I think a responsible healthcare provider should be considering some urine tests at least, and possibly a referral to a Urologist to see if it could be bladder/ kidney related, among other things. ### Thanks for the detailed response. I did go to an sti clinic. I had a urine and blood test but I don’t think it included tests for HSV. My symptoms are there almost everyday in some form. I think the doctor thinks that I’m better off not knowing. I got prescribed valtrex and honestly unfortunately it seems to help if I take it every day. It takes about a week to start working. Symptoms are present but very mild on 500mg a day. And pretty much non existent with 100mg a day. Somebody said the girl I was with looked like she was getting a cold sore in the morning. If it’s hsv1 is it a lot less likely that I’ll pass it on to a partner? Because I’ve been to the only sti clinic in town I don’t know where else to go. She gave me a bj and cought me with her tooth. I couldn’t see a break in the skin but it hurt there mildly. A couple of months or so later I started to get a recurring pain there. Then that stopped and the pain appeared in two more places under the foreskin. But never in the original spot. I do have kidney pain sometimes but I’ve had ultrasounds and bloods taken and everything checks out ok. Doc prescribed valtrex because my mental health was down in the dumps and I sort of demanded it. I really hope it isn’t that but it’s not looking good for me. ### You’re already behaving like you have it and taking the antivirals everyday. I don’t think you should be having symptoms everyday and your dr should be trying to figure out what is causing it instead of blindly prescribing you antivirals. You should demand the test and if it’s positive you can carry on as you already are but if it’s negative you can start looking for other possible reasons for your symptoms. ### You’re right. Thanks. ### Np, I hope this helps you find the reason for your symptoms bc I don’t believe it could all be attributed to hsv ### Well I spoke to the doctor today. He said that because there are no visible lesions then he has no reason to think that it’s HSV. He said that sometimes when we’re paranoid about something we can manifest pain. I know that this is absolutely not true in my case and I said that. I asked if I can have the blood test for HSV. He said there’s no reason to have that. He said if I want to then I should go in for a swab but if there are no lesions then it won’t detect anything. Offered me some anti anxiety medication that I don’t want. I said the antivirals made it go away so can I have some more if you’re not going to test me for anything because it stresses me out. I’m in a complicated situation and need to know if I’ve got it to not spread whatever I have. I’m pretty lost with it because I keep asking for help but they’re not giving it to me. It’s the only sti clinic in town. Maybe a gp is a better option. ### I’m really sorry you’re going through this.

tblofl,"What are my chances of HSV2? I slept with someone last weekend who disclosed they had hsv2. 

They haven’t had an OB since 2017 and had several long term partners since then who she had unprotected sex with and none contracted it. She isn’t on anti virals.

I’m OHSV1 positive. I used protection, however I can’t be sure if the condom rode up and exposed any of my skin to hers, but I think it may be possible. When giving me a hand job she forgot to take off her rings, which I believe caused abrasion and left small cuts on my dick.

2 days I noticed my shaft/head/balls were tingling and quite warm. I wouldn’t say it was painful, but my glands felt kind of tender. No signs of lesions at all, but it did seem like my dick might have been friction burned a little. I went to the doctor and he said there was nothing of clinical significance he could see/feel and sent me to get tested. My junk has felt a bit sore/tender periodically over the last few days, but end and flows and has largely abated. The tingling sensation abated after 2 days and only occurs if I masturbate it run. It seems weird that so much of my balls would feel like this too if I was positive.

The fact she hasn’t infected any partners she’s slept with unprotected, hasn’t had an OB in 5 years, I wore a condom and an OHSV1 positive are favorable for me, but the sore and tender genitals and a rare sensation of something that feels like it may be nerve related down my back or thigh (not painful) and the fact my dick would have had open wound from friction have me unsure. It’s 6 days fine and I feel relatively normal except for tenderness and occasional warmth. What do you guys think the chances of me having HSV2 is? Do I sound like I am positive or just the victim of a rough handjob?",12,2022-03-11 03:35:45-05:00,"I always find the comment of a person knowing they haven’t infected anyone interesting. As some people remain asymptomatic after being infected & testing for hsv not being a standard sti test , i always wonder how would someone really know if they haven’t infected anyone. 

Condoms do not offer complete protection against hsv as they do not cover the whole genital area that can shed . 

Studies have shown that having ohsv 1 offers no protection to contracting hsv2. 

Positive side , no OB in 5 yrs good , using condoms good . Better if she were on the anti virals. ### Your chances are extremely small. ### It's probably just a friction burn and you got in your head about the HSV2 

None of those early symptoms are of HSV2

Unless you start to have actual blisters in the first two weeks of this encounter you should be good and then just get a blood test in three months that'll show if you have it and are asymptomatic

The chances of transmission from women to men is extremely small with no outbreaks present, someone has already given you the actual statistics on that in a different comment so I won't repeat it here. ### Thanks, I appreciate the candidness. 

My mind went to the same place, they could just be asymptomatic, just like if I have it now I could be. 

I heard that having HSV2 means it’s harder to contract hsv1, are you sure that the inverse isn’t true, given they are so similar? If you’ve got the study available I’d happily give it a read. ### Female-to-Male Ghsv2 transmission risk:  
  
If the situation is reversed and it's the woman who has genital hsv2 and the man doesn't and they both know she has it, if they have unprotected sex for an entire year (approximately twice per week) except during outbreaks and the woman takes no herpes medication, the man has a 4% chance of becoming infected by the end of the year.  
  
To reiterate: having sex more or less often than twice per week would raise or lower that base figure accordingly. And that base figure comes from studies of couples already in long term relationships, and herpes is slightly more likely to transmit when the partners have been together less than 3 months, or when the infection is still fairly recent (eg first six months etc).  
  
Condom use and herpes medication would each lower the female-to-male transmission risk by about 50% further from whatever it was before. So if the couple uses condoms or the woman takes medication, the annual risk to the man comes down to about 2%. And if they use both, it comes down to about 1%. As you can see, men are at considerably less risk of catching herpes than women when no condoms are used. But men also gain considerably less protection from condoms than do women.  


  


SOOOO in context. 1 sexual encounter instead of about 100 a year add in the condom, and she was diagnosed 5 years back.   


I know you can't do this but rough calculation should give you an 0.02% chance of transmission from that single intercourse.  


Higher chance your penis string was strectched or anoyed doing the intercourse. ### I want to believe it, but I think the fact I probably had open wounds isn’t promising and would increase my chances greatly.

Because I’m OHSV1 positive, it would be a non primary first OB, which to my understanding would be less serious and may not even show lesions. The corner of my eye has become painful and feels odd and I have a headache (a lot of this could be such stress induced psychosomaticism). It looks like even maybe a minor abrasion and there looks like maybe some yellow fluid around the bottom of my eye, but hard to tell if it looks like a lesion or HSV sore.

I’m going to feel pretty jipped if in spite of the low chances, I still get it. ### Yes i’m pretty sure that the inverse isn’t true, hsv2 supposedly gives protection to not contracting hsv1 but not other way around. 

Info on that has been posted on here a lot , likely to be on their wiki page & if not then the herpes handbook from expert terri warren will give you just about all the info you could ever need. 
If you think if it about 70% of us have hsv1 ( knowingly or unknowingly ) if it offered any protection then there wouldn’t be as many cases of people having both. Hsv1 often from childhood.

Also have read it on WHO site that having hsv1 , still at risk of hsv2. ### Unless your eye had any significant contact (fair amount of DIRECT contact like rubbing etc) with her genitals your eye was definitely not infected 

You're more likely to have your own OHSV1 present symptoms in your eyes than anything else 

Just relax for now, wait a couple of months and get tested. You'll know for sure 

It's also important to remember that you're more likely to catch it from someone who is unaware of their status than someone who is in fact aware ### I meant more so I may have passed it into myself by touching the infected area, not washing my hands thoroughly enough and then touching my eye, but I guess I’ll find out when the tests come back. ### No really, you can't pass herpes like with indirect contact. It's only even remotely possible if you have a blister that just burst and you touched that and then directly your eye, if at all. 

So unless your eye was rubbing against the infected area, its not gonna get infected. Believe me if it was possible for that to happen I'd have herpes all over me

Because when I got my first outbreak the doctors didn't think it was herpes so I definitely wasn't paying too much attention ### Thanks for the feedback, I appreciate it. When you had your first outbreak, may I ask how it exhibited itself if doctors didn’t think it was herpes initially? ### Looked like molluscum/whiteheads, never blistered or scabbed over either in the end 

They were so sure it was molluscum they took a swab cause I insisted but just did cryotherapy on the five spots I had to freeze them and that was that for them lol

tb68u7,"We Need Clarity So me and my partner are both eachothers firsts for everything. We were both virgins before we met and we have now been dating over 2 years. We are also curently long distance at different Universities and see eachother every few months, around Christmas and summertime, and usually once in between. She recently had a cut from shaving that led to an infection on her inner labia, and after going to the doctor they perscribed her medication, but they said nothing about a potential STD. After this it started to go away and for her it was basically back to normal.

A couple days ago I visited her and we attempted to have sex but it felt very uncomfortable so we stopped right away. Later the same day she started to get sore which rose concerns, and today when she went to the health clinic they said it was most likely genital herpes. Of course, with this being said, both of us have accused the other of cheating. We both have swore on our mothers lives that we havent cheated, and believe me our relationship is very healthy and we have so much trust in eachother it is just not a possibility. We have since been trying to figure out any way that could have been possible for her to get it. It really makes no sense to us.

She got tested today and the results wont come back for 2-3 days, so until then we dont know forsure. But the doctors said “most-likely”. Since then have just been trying to figure how this could have happend. We also have 0 history of herpes between us, and no other signs of any STDs. 

To make things clearer, she has never kissed another boy before we started dating. I have kissed two other girls in the past, but no sexual contact what so ever. This was also over 3 years ago, and I have had no signs of herpes since. We have been having sex for around 2 years now, and have had no signs since.

I use HealthLab.com which is a partner of STDcheck.com.  I've also used Request a test.com.  Here in the USA they fax a prescription over to your local LabCorp or Quest Diagnostics and you go get the test at your convenience; results are emailed usually the next day or so.  This way there are no Doctor fees nor medical record of it; only you have the results. ### Herpes can stay dormant in your body for years.

tb1qdn,"How to distinguish if it’s genital HSV-1 or HSV-2? (F) Newbie with the first outbreak waiting for test results Hi! Just a week ago I started to develop some HSV symptoms (almost immediately after sex with a partner i’ve been with for 6 months) where I have small painful blisters on one side of my genital lips, and also 3 painful pimples on the other that i got just a day ago. 

I rushed to a clinic today requesting a herpes test specifically, and the lady nurse announced that unfortunately it is definitely herpes I am having just by looking at it. She didn’t take a blood test but a swab test that will take 5 days to develop.

I would like to know if this cotton swab test will tell me whether I have HSV-1 or HSV-2, I was too shocked and upset to ask about that and the nurse didn’t mention anything. The reason I wanna know is that it might change the dynamic with my partner completely. First off, I myself might have had HSV-1 not knowing, both my parents do, my first bf had it, I just never had cold sores on my lips. Second, my partner has been asymptomatic all this time and before too, we’ve been together for some time now, though I know the virus can be dormant, in the country we live in they sadly don’t test anyone without sores (!!!) which he doesn’t have. I did have some other diseases though, like strep throat, and it was negative, but how could this be HSV-2 if i had swollen throat glands? Other STD tests came all negative a month ago too.

Has anybody had similar situations when their partners were asymptomatic, and you didn’t show symptoms until months later? How did you know it was HSV-2, did you have to take a blood test specifically? 

Would appreciate any of your insights and stories!",1,2022-03-10 10:54:16-05:00,">I would like to know if this cotton swab test will tell me whether I have HSV-1 or HSV-2

That depends on whether the particular swab test you were given is *type-specific*, meaning that it can specify which *type* of herpes is detected if any is detected. Most swab tests *are* type specific, but some irresponsible clinics use non-type-specific swab tests -- which poses a problem because if you have herpes then you need to know which type you have and blood tests cannot be relied on to do that later. (blood tests sometimes miss infections, especially hsv1 infections -- this is explained on our wiki page on herpes testing: [LINK](https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/wiki/herpes_testing)).

My suggestion would be to call the clinic where you had your swab done and ask whether it was a type-specific swab that is able to identify which type of herpes is detected if any is detected. If it wasn't, then find somewhere else you can go and get a type-specific swab done.

Note that there are two different kinds of swab tests available for herpes: viral culture or PCR. PCR is newer and is much more sensitive than viral culture. Viral culture can be fine for pronounced, blister-type symptoms, and the sort of classic cold-sore-type blisters that herpes is known for -- especially if liquid can be extracted from the blister/lesion. But for less pronounced symptoms, or symptoms that don't have obvious blistering, or especially for symptoms that have partially healed, PCR is strongly preferable.

Note also that PCR swabs are less widely available than viral culture swabs. So if you think you would benefit from a PCR swab then call the clinic in advance to ask whether they offer PCR swabs for herpes testing before you make an appointment to go in. If they don't offer PCR then ask if they're aware of any local clinics that do, and try calling some other local providers. ### ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tb1qdn/how_to_distinguish_if_its_genital_hsv1_or_hsv2_f/

tazwo1,"O to G transmission HSV1 Long time reader, first time poster.  Hi!  In 2021, I had a casual sex night with a guy and a makeout session with another guy within a couple weeks of each other.  I got the first cold sore of my life a week after that (F39 at time, now 40), in June.  I didn't know who it might have come from (hadn't been intimate with anyone else for a couple years prior; had my last HSV screen in 2017 and was negative for both) but when I talked to boy 2 he said ""Oh, yeah, I get them all the time, I wonder if you got them from me, whoops.  Sorry.""  We... don't talk anymore.  He had no visible symptoms when we hooked up.  He chose to not say anything about it, and the dice came up to pay the piper for me.

I started treating the cold sore with Abreva, started taking lysine, tried not to freak out.  I went to my doctor for a swab, but it had healed fairly quickly and the test was inconclusive.  I had a second cold sore in September, but it also healed very quickly.  

I have been down the rabbit hole on this sub and I am so grateful to the posts that I have seen, because they've been oh so helpful in how I should approach this.  I fully believe in being a disclosure person, because I don't want anyone to feel like their agency was taken by me.  They should have the decision on whether or not they want to be involved with me (I have some other baggage, like most of us do by my age, so it's part of the spiel at this point).

I met a guy, and we've been talking and enjoying each other's company and are both interested in taking our relationship to a new level.  I disclosed, and it went well.  He also has cold sores.

But, here is my question.  I'm a baby bird in this world, so I want to have all the information I can have to educate myself, to talk well with him, etc.  I know that there is a rise in GHSV1, but I have also seen studies telling me that if you have OHSV1, you're less likely to be ""reinfected"" in your genital area.  Is that right?  If that's the case, I guess I don't understand how GSHV1 is on the rise, given how common OHSV1 is.  It feels counterintuitive that there would be an increase in GSHV1 if you can't get it from a partner if you already get oral cold sores.

Does that make sense?  If my partner and I engage in oral sex, do we have a likelihood of transmitting our oral cold sores to each others genitals?  We're both adults and we're willing to have this conversation.  But neither of us are aware of a clear answer.  My doctor won't even put me on antivirals because I don't have frequent outbreaks.  In fact, she told me ""Now you have the perfect excuse to never perform oral sex again, hurray!""  And that feels a little misinformed and biased.  

I would rather have information from sources that I understand and trust.  THANK YOU!",3,2022-03-10 09:28:14-05:00,"The reason ghsv1 is on the rise is because the prevalence of oral hsv1 is decreasing. Those with oral hsv1 are protected from getting it genitally, but that’s less and less of the population. ### > I have also seen studies telling me that if you have OHSV1, you're less likely to be ""reinfected"" in your genital area. Is that right?

If you already have ohsv1 then, for all practical purposes, you are protected from catching ghsv1. There *can* be rare exceptions to that but that is the general rule. To simply say you're ""less likely"" to catch it genitally after already having it orally is a gross over-statement of the risk.

Here are some quotes from herpes expert Terri Warren on her clinic forum. Terri has a 35+ year career researching and treating herpes specifically, and also regularly collaborates with the experts at the University of Washington, who are considered among the top herpes experts *in the world*, and with whom her opinions on such matters are in agreement:

>Once you have one type of HSV in one location, you are extremely unlikely to get it in a new location.

([Source](https://www.westoverheights.com/forum/question/discordant-hsv-2-couple/))

>Once you have a herpes infection of a specific type in one location on your body, you are extremely unlikely to get it in a new location. 

([Source](https://www.westoverheights.com/forum/question/dental-bone-graft-and-genital-herpes/))

>Once you have established herpes in one location of your body, there is very close to zero chance that you would get it (ie the same type) at a new location on your body.

([Source](https://www.westoverheights.com/forum/question/transmission-4/))

>Once you have HSV 2 (or HSV 1) in one location on your body for at least 4 months or so, it is extremely unlikely that you would get it in a new location on your body due to the immune response that you have established.

([Source](https://www.westoverheights.com/forum/question/herpes-whitlow-4/))

>Once a herpes infection is well established (4 months or longer), getting the same virus in a new location is almost unheard of.

([Source](https://www.westoverheights.com/forum/question/transmission-between-2-carriers/))

And here a client asked:

>Can you quantify my resistance to aquiring HSV1 genitaly since I already have HSV 1 orally?

And Terri replied:

> I have seen this once in my entire career. (34+ years)

tb44r8,"Navigating outbreak 1 year into monogamous relationship I haven't been diagnosed but I am 95% certain I'm having a herpes outbreak a year into my monogamous relationship (to the day - it came up on our anniversary!). I know my boyfriend didn't cheat on me, I trust him completely. 

4ish years ago I had what I was completely certain was a herpes outbreak. It had all the symptoms - a serious fever a week or so before the red, bumpy, itchy rash broke out. I went through the stages - grief, research, acceptance. Two tests came back negative. I thought that was pretty weird but my doctor, who had discouraged me from getting my second test, basically told me to relax and move on with my life. So I did, up until yesterday, when after sex my boyfriend noticed ""a rash"" on my upper thigh/butt area. Little red bumps that now look fluid filled. Ugh.

It's weird because the last time I thought I had herpes I reached the acceptance stage - I know that herpes isn't a big deal. If I do have it, this will be my second outbreak in over 4 years. I've had plenty of fun, promiscuous sex over the years and no one has ever contacted me with concerns. But now I'm in a relationship with someone I could seriously see myself marrying and I'm terrified. He's been great so far - so relaxed, reassuring, and caring. But what if I gave it to him? We've been having sex without condoms for most of our relationship. He's no saint but escaped unscathed & is proud of his lifelong ""STD free"" status. I'm worried about how this will affect him emotionally and how it will affect our relationship.

I would love to hear other people's advice about herpes and long term relationships.

tb2a22,"Oral to Genital Transmission Rate? I hooked up with a guy who had a cold sore. I didn’t look very closely though at first since so many people have skin blemishes. It wasn’t until we kissed several times and he went down on me that I noticed the bump on the corner of his lips looked cracked and strange and then it hit me what it was.
I got symptoms orally a few days after that, I had a persistent cough, swollen tonsils and lymph nodes and a cut that may or may not have been herpes related. 
I didn’t notice anything strange down there in that time. But a couple months after that time, I shaved and then came some bumps. Including just one that was clear and was filled with clear fluid when I popped it. I freaked out and got that area checked out and was diagnosed with folliculitis and they didn’t bother swabbing for herpes.
I have an appointment with a gyno in a few days to just swab around and see if anything comes up but I don’t think it will and see if she has any way of testing for genital herpes when there are no symptoms. 
I wanted to ask, given everything I’ve said, what are the chance that during my first vaginal exposure to an active cold sore, is it that I have it too? I have no immunity against it whatsoever but I’m still hoping by some miracle I don’t actually have it.",0,2022-03-10 11:19:01-05:00,,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tb2a22/oral_to_genital_transmission_rate/
tb256c,"How to tell if it’s genital HSV-1 or 2 while waiting for results? (F) Newbie with the first outbreak Hi! Just a week ago I started to develop some HSV symptoms (almost immediately after sex with a partner i’ve been with for 6 months) where I have small painful blisters on one side of my genital lips, and also 3 painful pimples on the other that i got just a day ago. 

I rushed to a clinic today requesting a herpes test specifically, and the lady nurse announced that unfortunately it is definitely herpes I am having just by looking at it. She didn’t take a blood test but a swab test that will take 5 days to develop.

I would like to know if this cotton swab test will tell me whether I have HSV-1 or HSV-2, I was too shocked and upset to ask about that and the nurse didn’t mention anything. The reason I wanna know is that it might change the dynamic with my partner completely. First off, I myself might have had HSV-1 not knowing, both my parents do, my first bf had it, I just never had cold sores on my lips. Second, my partner has been asymptomatic all this time and before too, we’ve been together for some time now, though I know the virus can be dormant, in the country we live in they sadly don’t test anyone without sores (!!!) which he doesn’t have. I did have some other diseases though, like strep throat, and it was negative, but how could this be HSV-2 if i had swollen throat glands? Other STD tests came all negative a month ago too.

Has anybody had similar situations when their partners were asymptomatic, and you didn’t show symptoms until months later? How did you know it was HSV-2, did you have to take a blood test specifically? 

Would appreciate any of your insights and stories!",1,2022-03-10 11:12:41-05:00,"I don’t know what exactly you’re asking regarding strep and all that but as far as what type you have the swab should tell you!

taxk9b,Staying with someone who gave you hsv… So I felt like I had finally came to start forgiving my bf.. when I did more research and found out a lot of people don’t know they have HSV or info on how it passes etc…he kept saying I’ll do anything for you until I started asking all I asked is for him to sit in on a couple therapy sessions with me and his response was please don’t make me do that… so you can give me HSV put me through hell and claim you want to be with me for the rest of our lives so HSV doesn’t matter but you won’t even sit in a therapy session with me because you hate therapy…? I’m going insane.. trying to understand why someone would do all of this to me…it really makes no sense…I’ve done everything for him…I really don’t wanna be alone and I know that’s where this is gonna end up going 😩,13,2022-03-10 07:25:49-05:00,"I’ve had cold sores since I was a baby. This seems like a reasonable and healthy request. You are asking him to hear you out with your support team. He’s letting you know he won’t do anything for you. In particular, he won’t listen to the effects of his actions on you in a place where you feel safe and supported in sharing them. 🚩 🚩 🚩 ### Therapy is a vulnerable process and if someone doesn’t want to go, the outcome isnt going to be positive. You’re willing to go. Your therapist should help you with resources on how to have discussions at home with him as well as education information to open up and have meaningful conversations. He may come around eventually but you can’t force it. ### I understand how you feel, but it was not intentional and you have to understand that although some of us suffer more than others, literally most of the worlds including children get cold sores which is HSV1.. majority of people are asymptomatic and have no idea they have it. I personally don’t think that warrants couples therapy, although it might be good for you to seek individual therapy. Trust me I’m not judging I am severely immuno compromised and I went 33 years without ever getting it. My boyfriend and I went on a break and he slept with the friend that I never liked that’s a female. The girl I never trusted and always said slept around. I got HSV when I was going through cancer. We are still together. It’s not his fault even though he knew she was not exactly the most stand up girl around. People get this all the time from being kissed on the cheek as a kid or sharing a drink with someone. Just don’t do what I did and torture him over it to the point the relationship almost broke over something that was not intentional. ### I went to therapy twice and hated it it was useless so I can understand why he does not want to go. That’s why if you must insist on this find a therapist you both agree on ### Exactly and I even explained my therapist understand HSV she even said it is possible to pass without knowing etc in no way shape or form is it some gang up on him thing and I wanted to make him feel comfortable as well in a sense but just want him to be there for me through this difficult time… ### It’s not even couples therapy… it’s individual I wanted him to just sit in with me on a couple of sessions it hurts that he wasn’t even willing to give it a thought I can forgive him for the HSV… but if you’re really truly wanting to be with someone for the rest of your life etc you should be willing to do anything for them and be there for them wether this was unintentional or not..I’m the only one dealing with any consequences from it. ### If you didn’t get HSV from him, you’d get it at some point throughout your lifetime I don’t think you understand how common it is…. Pretty hard to go through life without getting it. You have to realize it’s not just about you. Just because you feel some thing is good for the both of you doesn’t mean that your opinion is the only one that should matter. Couples therapy works for some but it can cause a lot of conflict for others. Keep in mind the job of a therapist is just that… a job…. The hard work comes from within. ### And again it’s not couples therapy and it’s the fact he didn’t even give it a thought after saying I’ll do anything to make this right.. I’m sure eventually I can look past the HSV I was already some what forgiving him for that but if your life partner can’t even sit in on a couple therapy sessions with you then what else will they not do? That’s not right… ### That’s your opinion. I personally think a couple therapy makes a lot of problems and no matter what I did to somebody if they wanted me to sit in on it, from what I have personally seen I would say absolutely not because I know how bad it could actually make things. Your boyfriend shouldn’t have to be saying I’ll do anything to make it right because honestly he didn’t do anything wrong unless he went out and was cheating on you. I was betrayed and I still don’t feel like he owes me anything. The betrayal part, sure. Giving me HSV as a result, no. Not his fault. He didn’t know the person had it. I’m going to say again, most of the world has it. I don’t think you should be punishing him or giving it so much thought. ### Therapy isn’t a punishment and someone should at least be willing to TRY it and then if it didn’t work so be it.. but not even wanting to try is not a good sign. ### Once again that’s your opinion. I’d rather cut my arm off then go through therapy. It’s caused so much harm. It actually caused irreparable damage to my past relationship after one session. They put a whole bunch of shit in both of our heads that wasn’t even an issue and shouldn’t have been. You’re saying it’s not punishment, but it is. You’re asking him to do couples therapy for an imaginary problem. If he did not intentionally give it to you, it’s your own problem not his. ### You’re entitled to your own opinion, but just because you had a negative experience doesn’t mean that you’re correct and all therapy is bad. Therapy can be very helpful in many of ways and if what she asked was for him to sit in with her after all she’s going through, the least he can do is support her. That’s common sense. ### Of course, but my point is that it doesn’t mean he’s wrong either. It’s not his fault it’s more of her issue. ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/taxk9b/staying_with_someone_who_gave_you_hsv/

I literally have been crying for the past two days alone in my room. 
I’ve always been safe. I have always been clean. I get tested after every partner. I’ve never even had a yeast infection before. 
I was previously diagnosed with depression anxiety and PTSD and this is just making my depression worse.

It’s hard at first but the more you allow yourself to get it all out the sooner you will start building yourself back up. I know it’s hard to accept it but you have an amazing family of people here willing to help you and guide you, and there is no rush on re building your empire of life 🌺 

I hated it when I first got it, but I’m tankful for it. It’s taught me a lot about myself and about love, both self love and giving love. Taught me a lot about trust and  how to control my toughts.

It’s not that bad, little discomfort one in a while, if you take antivirals you could go years without a thing.

I’m sorry you’re going through this ### did he give you oral sex? what are the symptoms exactly? ### Hey I understand the depression I was depressed for years until I finally decided enough was enough. I have been diagnosed for 10 years and have had  20+ partners since diagnosis. None of them to their knowledge have genital herpes some had cold sores. I am currently with a guy who is completely HSV negative he works at a blood lab and took a test just for shits and giggles.  He knows about my herpes I disclosed and he is completely fine with it and accepts the risks. There are plenty of people like this who do not care. Sitting around and waiting for a cure it’s silly you’re rejecting yourself before anyone even has a chance to think about it or reject you or accept you. You are putting limits on yourself before giving anyone else the opportunity to consider anything. People get rejected every day for a plethora of different reasons Sure there are people who ghosted me especially on tinder but as I talked to my friends I realized they got ghosted too and it wasn’t because of herpes it was because dating apps are cesspools in general. Dating nowadays sucks for so many reasons if you want to pin it on herpes go for it but that’s not the only reason. I was diagnosed with ghsv-1 at 19 and I thought my life was over I didn’t tell a soul cut off friends and everything because I felt so disgusting and gross. But eventually I put myself out there and had a few positive disclosure s and i began to realize that I was the one creating the stigma for myself.. The more people I told the less it weighted me down. Think of it logically friends should care because it doesn’t effect them. The only people your herpes effects are the people you are sleeping With. Friends are supposed to be your support system and if you tell them your story they should not judge you And they will learn from you And your experience. Hell you May even help a fellow herpes person out becuase if someone discloses to your friend after you teach them about herpes they will be more understanding and knowledgeable about it. But that’s up to you. I’ll attach some links that have seemed to help people and if you need anything please dm me.I’ve had it for almost a decade at this point and have a pretty good handle on it.

Please reach out if you need anything!! I promise it gets bettertr ### this isnt for sure but it sounds like you maybe have gHsv1, your symptoms sounds just like my gfs, it sucks now but once ur Ob clears up u may never have an outbreak again and if you do it will never be like this. ### That’s terrible that he removed the condom. :/

Sorry, there’s no cure for herpes, so either you misheard your doctor or they’re uninformed.

He may have meant is there’s a chance (taking valtrax) you won’t have another outbreak, that this will be your only experience with these symptoms. Initial outbreaks are the worst! Mine no longer hurt.

Do you have HSV-1 or HSV-2? ### I am not sure of the incubation period but same day seems too short... I got it in January, once you get past the initial outbreak things go back to normal for most people. I also take daily antivirals but other than that I don't even think about it except when I need to disclose. It is fairly common to only have one outbreak ever or rarely as in years apart. I hope we are both in that catagory.

The official stats are here in this forum but what helped me was realizing how long it can stay dormant (potentially forever) and that most people have it and most of those don't know. Statisticly it is safer to be with someone who knows and takes precautions than it is to be with someone who doesn't know.

Something else to keep in mind is that it is passed skin to skin, no fluids required. A condom will not stop it. I got it while wearing a condom and my penis is the only part of my crotch that did not break out. What this means is that I or you could have had it long before the initial outbreak and there is no way to place blame unless someone was having an active outbreak when you had sex with them.

Bottom line the perception of how bad it is will be far worse than the truth of it. In the end it is a common skin condition that happens in an uncomfortable place. ### Here are links to 2 support groups. The bottom one has a virtual meetup this Sunday at 7pm EST. It may help to see, talk & listen to others with HSV.

I want you to know that passing it on to your children through birth should not be a concern. The majority of the world has herpes and doctors are well-prepared to prevent transmission during birth. Maybe your partner will get it through sex, maybe they wont. But just like this outbreak, time will heal your feelings about it <3 After 6 years, its not a big deal to me, nor any of my multiple partners throughout the years. ### Supposed to get the test before every partner.  Not after.   It’s a lesson we all have learned the hard way. ### Thank you so much. 
Honestly I am probably going to start working out. Taking my frustration out in the gym. At least make it so I like looking at myself in the mirror .. I just feel so in shock I guess right now. 
I’m worried about the fact I can pass it on to someone .. especially if I have children. 
I know it’s new so I don’t have all the information about it and I have to see a doctor after a week it just.. it’s been a rough year already and the one time I enjoy myself I get herpes. 
I’ve been on the meds two days and it still hurts so badly to pee. I haven’t even been able to take a dookie because it hurts so badly — which might be tmi but it’s been three days. 
I just want to feel normal. 

And I know the stigma is bad .. but the person I really like knows I have it.. and he understands. He still wants to be with me in the future (we live a few hours away and I’m in college) and it breaks my heart because I don’t even want to be me. Or with me. I love sex and now the thought of it just scares me .. Like how are things going to be from now on? ### Maybe the doctor meant never having an outbreak again! I’m going through my first outbreak too and I’m hoping it’s one and done for me. ###  I just don’t want to give it to the ones I love .. I don’t want to pass it on to my future husband (if I marry) or my children (again if I have any) 
That’s what scares me the most. 

The pain I am in is unbearable.. I just want to keep everyone safe. I just love sex .. and it sucks because now I feel like I have to give it all up in order to keep others safe. ### You won’t have to give it up. When I met my wife she eventually just decided she didn’t care and she got it from me so we were both on the same level. That’s probably not very common, but you can still have lots of sex, if you’re having an outbreak that’s the perfect time to pleasure your partner as a treat, as long as you’re not in too much discomfort. ### Thank you. I’m talking to my therapist soon hopefully .. it just is shocking. I can’t believe it still and admitting it out loud .. makes it real ### Yes he gave me oral. 
I have half of a swollen vagina .. sounds weird. 
I have bumps and a rash of bumps all the way from the top to the bottom of my private area. I have burning when I use the bathroom. Constant pain no matter how I sit or lay. A sore throat. I did have a fever. The V shaped area on my inner hips hurt when I bend and stand up. 
I have a video of everything honestly to try and see if it is improving from where it is at. 
It almost feels like I have paper cuts all over with lemon juice in them ### It is genital herpes .. they didn’t say 
I’ve just been in shock honestly 

Is the only way that it gets passed during an outbreak? ### We had sex like 4 days in a row and it was after the last day where I started to have pains. Initially I thought it was just a cut from foreplay .. but it kept getting worse and worse. After 4 days I went to the doctor. 

I hope I don’t have another outbreak.. it just doesn’t make sense that I’ve been tested after everyone I was with and never had it before until now after sleeping with him. 
That’s the only reason I believe he gave it to me. 

I did tell him the results right away and he went and got tested .. I think what’s making me most sad is the fact I can pass it on to my children if I have any.. or my future husband if I do get married. 
Like the fact I can give it to someone else and they have to feel this way makes me depressed. 
And the fact I have been so cautious .. so clean and now this. 

I know I’ll come to terms with it .. but it’s just so new and the worst case of what I thought it was. ### Oh baby I know ! I can imagine the shock you are going through cause I did the same. Lucky for you you had medicine ahhaha I wasn’t going to tell my mom and unfortunately I am an Ecuadorian girl living in Miami with no insurance so I had to bare with the outbreaks. So my first outbreak lasted a month. 

I think doing that allowed my body to develop a better immune system and now outbreaks last 1 to 2 days by themselves. I have been considering getting medicine, I actually applied to a insurance for that, to keep a future partners safe. About the baby, don’t stress of situations that haven’t happened yet. Whenever a baby is coming find the solution but you can’t stress your body with things that haven’t happened. Remember Herps loves stress hhaha. 

To be honest Sex hasn’t been hard at all. I have disclosed 3 times already and have had sooo much unprotected sex. I think it’s cause I always thought that I didn’t loose an inch of my value when I got herpes. In fact, herpes made me change my life, but who I am in the eyes of others is still a reflection of what I show and what I allow to make me weak, herpes ain’t part of that. 

What it did give me was knowledge I never knew I wanted. Knowledge of not to date or mess with douches WHICH IS SAD CAUSE I LOVED TOXIC MEN. Hahahha but i asked life to make me wiser and help me find the one and only man for me. He gave me herpes and a huge heart, so so far I think I’m on the right track of life Hahha. 

A moment of science for all of those amazing toxic and sexy men that I will never hook up with cause they won’t swallow the herpes pill. And if you ain’t loving buddy Herps THEN YOU AINT THE ONE FOR ME Hahahha. Oh also, don’t stress. Herpes loves stress. Finds ways to make you find peace and YES go to the gym. Become the woman that handles herpes like a boss. Gains mentally and in the body !!! And take a doookie ! Hahha don’t let Herps win ! Even if you do the dookie slowly, don’t give up the dookie for herps. Feel the pain and tell him NOT TODAY BIATCH I AM TAKING MY DOOKIE :D.

 I promise you that if you wake up every day and fight against it, one day you will be so strong even you will be shocked. That’s when you will look at the mirror and love every inch of that warrior you became ❤️‍🔥 ### you just have to take the dookie, lol. when i first got diagnosed i was holding in my pee and poop bc it hurt so bad bc i had sores by my butthole too. just gotta ride the pain out temporarily. what helped me was spraying dermoblast on my vaginal area and butt then one minute later quickly pushing and peeing so i could be done. if you’re on meds it should go away within a week or so. it sucks so bad. i cried everyday. but a few months later i’m much better. i have one night stands w people and i just had an outbreak for the first time since last week bc i got sick with a cold and my eating was trash. but it’s gone away now and next week i’ll be able to go back to my daily sex life. i’m telling you i wanted to kms after finding out. in a few months you’ll forget about it ### it could be hsv1, try asking him if he has ever had cold sores in the past ### No, 70% of HSV infections happen when there are no symptoms. I’d ask your doctor to do a swab test while symptoms are present to find out your type. You’ll better know what to expect and have more options for safe sex. ### I absolutely understand how you feel and I’m so sorry you have to deal with it. I got HSV1 genitally and orally about 2 years ago from a cheating asshole. Also assumed it was an infected tear or cut down there, turned in to the literal worse pain I have ever felt. I was always trusting and careful with my partners. He claimed to have never had symptoms or anything. It happens. Experienced everything you described. Ended up having to take off work, and I spent most of my days in the bath tub just soaking in hot water. Definitely recommend that if you still have open sores, it really eases the pain. Buy some loose fitting cotton underwear too, not the most flattering but I promise it helps letting everything just “breathe”.

I get the feelings. I felt so disgusting for so long, that no one would want to sleep with me, settle down with me, etc. Talk to someone you can trust about your feelings. I had to open up to my mom about it initially, turns out she got it 30+ years ago from her ex husband, and she has never passed it on to the only partner she’s had since, my dad. Pregnancy sounds a little scary to me, as they monitor if you have another outbreak near delivery…if she had had one, I would’ve been a C-section baby to avoid easily passing it to me. Medicine and all has changed in 26 years so maybe that’s different now but.

I still take valtrex daily. I used to be glued to that bottle, afraid I’d miss a day. Now it’s easier, I can miss a day or two and be fine. I’ve never had a genital outbreak since contracting. I get oral outbreaks every now and then. There’s tons of lip gels to help eliminate them asap. That’s honestly the only issue I deal with anymore. The longer it’s living in your body, generally over time the less out breaks you’ll have. Time and meds help it lessen.

As for the feelings…I went back in to dating with the mindset of, “this will help me weed out anymore awful guys”(I wanted a serious relationship). Thankfully, the first person I starting going on dates with since contracting, I told on the 3rd or 4th date. I had dodged kissing him SO many times, that I finally broke down and told him over text. Thankfully he was awkward about when to even initiate a kiss as he’d been out of the dating game for awhile. But I explained it all to him…the possibility that he could catch it(me having it orally made it all a little more difficult), that I was on meds, no genital outbreaks since the initial, etc. Educated him the best I could. And he was totally fine with it. We(some might say stupidly) didn’t use protection when we started sleeping together, but neither of us have had ANY issues. I have not passed anything to him, even orally. We’ve been together almost a year now.

It DOES get better(especially when the first outbreak heals up. Physically that’s the worst part). I don’t really think about it anymore unless a cold sore pops up on my lips. Stress and spicy food generally trigger them for me 😂 it’s an annoyance more than anything. I take the daily anti-virals with the rest of my morning vitamins, so I hardly think twice about it.

I wish you all the best. It’s going to be okay and get better. If you want to talk to someone ever about it all, just hit me up ☺️ ### Do you disclose ? ### He says he doesn’t remember. 
I’ve never even had one ever. 
He had no bumps or symptoms when we were having sex but he said he was swollen after it but we did have a lot of sex. 
Can I ask what the difference is? I don’t have a lot of information on any of this. ### Sadly I cannot get swabbed as I am on my cycle and it’s too sore and swollen to open up. 
He swabbed the sore and they will probably end up mailing a letter with my results as well .. as most places seem to. But I may end up calling them and asking. 

Thank you so much for your advice. I do truly appreciate it ### so hsv1 typically is the mouth herpes or the one that causes cold sores, hsv2 is the genital kind and rarely occurs on the mouth. although hsv1 is the mouth kind it often infects people genitally during oral. since he gave you oral it could be hsv1 and he didn’t know he had it if he’s never had a cold sore or maybe he had one when he was young he doesn’t remember. the swab test will tell the difference though ### ",9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tapz9s/just_diagnosed_and_really_feeling_it/
tb0kpp,"Looking for advice Hey y’all! Needing to talk about my current situation and hoping for insight. 

Had unprotected sex 16 days ago. Drunk after a party - my own reckless choice. Next morning, my vagina is very sore from the rough sex and a bit itchy from friction (pretty normal for me). My period also started on this day, right after the sex. The itching continued for several days. 

Flash forward maybe 4-5 days and there’s a single bump on my labia, between the minora and majora but near the top. More on the pubic area than anything else. I literally just didn’t think anything of it, it only hurt if I wiped. Thought ingrown hair for sure. 

13 days after the initial encounter I decided to shave to see what was going on. Boom, open sore (didn’t notice any specific pain when shaving). Definitely irritated from shaving though. It was like a pinkish red colour, not particularly swollen around or anything. It looked like a split in my skin, but no blood which led me to think possibly herpes. No pain to the touch, not itchy. 

That night after the irritation from shaving had gone down, it was like a 1 cm long fissure. I called an online clinic to get recommended for testing, full panel and swab for hsv. He refused to include any blood work for hsv and said I had to get it swabbed. In the next morning (14 days after the unprotected sex) it was completely closed with a small scab, which was off by day 15. 

I have no other symptoms of hsv. No waiting until I find another sore that can be swabbed, or my doctor can recommend blood work.

What have peoples initial ob experience been like? Is this likely hsv? I will certainly follow through on all testing but am driving myself nuts and just want to chat it out.",2,2022-03-10 10:00:47-05:00,"My experience was similar. Like exact same situation. except mine kept getting worse. If you just had one then idk, it’s hard to say. It hasn’t spread since ? I am no expert as I am still experiencing the symptoms rn. do you have any tingling or sharp glass sensastions ? ### None at all, and no!

tanzef,Honest question for ladies. Does living with HSV change how lubricated you get? Is a side effect of medication or the diagnosis a reason to stop getting wet?,26,2022-03-09 21:14:17-05:00,"The meds dry me out. If you aren’t getting wet at all at all it’s maybe a psychological reaction—guilt and shame type stuff. ### No, not for me. ### It is, for me. I never got wet again. Since I got it. ### Have you tried drinking more water? I know mine is at least part psychological as I’m just more in my head worried about exposing my partner during sex and etc. But I notice less of an issue if I’m drinking 60- 120 oz of water a day in addition to coffee and tea lol ### it hasn’t impacted it for me. i also take 1g valacyclovir daily. ### I thought it did for me. Maybe it did at first. However I've noticed changes when I've quit birth control. But not the biggest problem as now I don't have sex without lube even when I don't need it. It's more comfortable. ### 20F, I have ghsv2. I only take meds for an outbreak whenever they happen. No issues, I'm still the same lol ### Nothing has changed for me . ### I still get wet. ### Nope ### Nope. For me, it hasn't changed. ### I have ghvs2 and I have noticed that before an outbreak I am very dry down there…even during intimacy. ### Yes…I think it’s mental for me…I feel repulsive and nasty and never feel attractive. I am sure that’s the reason why when the time presents itself I can’t get with it. ### Been on valtrex almost a year and have not had this issue... Even before i went on meds. ### we used to spit start to have sex if we were in a rush, but I think that’s exactly how I got GHSV1. he never had herpe symptoms in his life but he must’ve been positive and with type 1. Now if we’re in a rush we start with lube and then I proceed to get as the sex carries on. 

if you’re uncomfortable from guilt or anxious of the thought, just try out lube to speed the process along and you won’t even worry about it! Idk how long this has been going on for you but if it’s recent just give it time!  I dont take medicine everyday tho like some people do, so i’m sure that plays a factor because it’s medicine going into your body every day. ### I do have some issues but I think it’s mostly psychological, I have seen taking Maca root can help with natural lubrication but libido as well :) I have taken some like over the course of a week and it helped a little, but still need lube for penetration. just be careful because it also apparently increases fertility 🥴 ### Yes it did. I have a hard time getting wet now. I have ghsv-2. ### definitely felt that i get insanely dry and nervous as soon as they go near my area because i’m so self conscious ### Is it medication? Sorry just wondering if it can be reversed don’t want to be rude. ### Wow this is like one of my biggest fears, I’m pretty sure i have genital herpes still waiting on the 12 week period to retest but wow i really want to be able to have normal great sex again since I’m usually really nicely lubricated ### ^ ### Hmm this is interesting. Do you have an outbreak around every month? A lot of girls get outbreaks due to their hormone change in their cycle which could also have something to do with the lubrication. ### No problem, I don’t mind sharing my experience. I started suppressive therapy with Valtrex just last month . I got GHSV2 in February 2021. I don’t know what the cause may be. Physically, there’s no problem with me except that I’m GHSV2 positive & it has resulted in a loss of my normal lubrication. ### It is indeed possible to have normal, great sex again :) Everybody responds differently under different kinds of stress. This is just my personal experience, it’s not necessary that your body will react similarly. ### Has anything helped to reverse that? ### Nothing yet ### ",9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tanzef/honest_question_for_ladies/
tasjuo,"Can you spread herpes from one part of your body to another? I haven't ever had an outbreak that I've been aware of, and haven't been sexually active in over a year now. If I were to touch my face/genitals would it be possible for me to spread herpes to another part of my body immediately after touching that? What if I had saliva or another bodily fluid on my fingers when I touched the other part of my body? I've read from different health websites (WebMD) that this is possible. I wanted to know how worried/careful I should be. I've only had one sexual partner (last time was over a year ago now) and neither of us had symptoms while we were together. I haven't had any since. We always used condoms, including for oral with the exception of one time. Would touching my mouth then genitals, or my genitals then mouth or other part of my body lead to spreading it from one part of my body to another?",6,2022-03-10 01:34:40-05:00,"This is called autoannoculation. This CAN happen but it is only likely  to happen during your primary outbreak or rarely during an outbreak. After your primary outbreak your body builds up antibodies to herpes meaning that it is not only harder to catch the same herpes strain from others but also from yourself. So the longer you have herpes the less likely you are to re-catch it in a different area. When you are having an outbreak is when you are the most contagious in general, to play it safe make sure to wash your hands after touching a herpes sore with soap and water. (Simple warm water and bathroom soap kills the herpes virus no need for harsh chemicals)

Please reach out if you need anything!! I promise it gets bettertr ### I’m two and a half years in and every single day I want to die. Even on good days I could be mid laughter then I remember and my world goes dark grey again. I meet someone I like then they make a weird comment about STIs and I have to let them go to skip the awkward conversation. It sucks and it may never stop sucking. I had a big weekend planned away, my outbreak started on Monday all the bumps and symptoms. No way I can go anymore. It fucking truly sucks having this virus ### It's just a skin infection that surfaces on average once per year.  Then you just can't be sexually active during those 5-14 days.  In the grand scheme of things it's nothing. 

Media and society has made it into this icky thing.  It's like 1 in 5 people have it.  So look around at your friends.  There's a chance that one of them has it, and if not, a few of them will have herpes by the time they're 40.  There's also a high chance that people who have it don't even know it. 

The only difference in your life is that you have to tell people about it, and have to abstain for a few days each year (during outbreak). 

I hope the best for you!  Love yourself and love the people around you!  They all love you, no matter what!  A little skin infection isn't going to change how they feel about you!  It's a good time to grab those closest friends and pull them closer and tell them how you're feeling <3 ### N you ain’t the first but you take a while to adjust to your situation, and look at the bigger picture ### Talk to your most trusted friend… when you’re ready. I would encourage you to go out and have fun or at least try. I understand it’s difficult but for myself staying inside makes me depressed over a long period of time. ### I've had herpes for like, 7 years. It ain't nothing but a thing. There's some things you can do to treat it. The quicker you accept that this is your reality, the quicker it'll stop having a negative affect upon your life. You're not broken or lesser. It's just a thing. ### I just found out about 2 months ago. The first few days were so rough. Hang in there. I am doing better now, but I have moments where it stops me in my tracks. I’ve only told my partner (that unfortunately we are ending things, not related to herpes), my mom and my doctor. My mom is super conservative and surprisingly has been very supportive. I even had to tell her I’ve been hookin up with a much younger man and I’m a mom so I felt sooooo ashamed. But there are a million podcasts out there on the topic. They have helped me a lot. Lots of talk about how common it is. It sucks, yes, but I’m slowly coming to terms. Hang in there and reach out if you need someone to talk to. ### hey if you wanna talk privately we can!!! i promise it’s not as bad as you think! :) message me if you wanna chat! ### Have you considered talking to one of your friends? I’ve talked to one friend about HSV. ### How old are you? ### Is it hsv1 or hsv2? And Genital or oral herpes? ### Its just the stigma that surrounds it not so much the fact that you have it.  Educated yourself. People are more accepting then you think. I remember I am talking to a guy and he was like ewww herpes. Then I told him I had HSV 1. I explain to him what it was how I got it in. It’s been almost a year and we still talk. Don’t let it damper your day it just a skin condition. ### Ur just like everyone else who also has hsv1…half ur family prolly has it too…the issue is everyone’s body reacts differently and for whatever reason yours doesn’t contain the virus as well so you have breakouts…your just as contagious as most of the planet is assuming your not in the middle of a breakout. ### Last night was the first night I felt okay, like almost my usual pre-diagnosis. I watched a show one of my friends really enjoyed, and it made me happy to share how I felt about the show with him. He was the one who gave this to me. He’s been there every step of the way through me figuring it all out.

I’m nervous about another outbreak. I have hsv-1 transmitted by his ohsv-1, and have only had one outbreak.

I have no idea how I’m going to cope with another, if I get one. I’m scared and nervous about it. But yesterday I did feel okay after I felt like I may not ever feel so. And that’s after wanting to just die after diagnosis for three weeks.

Also, I haven’t even entered dating or the understanding of that whole world yet. I may relapse my thought process when I have to face that path. ### Thank you 🙏 ### Yeah i've had similar issue. Like i make plans with friends but i cancel them or just don't show up because having this really fucking sucks. I can't get this thought out of my head that i'm some kind of plague or virus and i don't know what i did to be cursed with this. I hear from this site that it's so common but i'm literally the only one in my friend group, family, that has this fucking thing. I'm so burnt out and exhausted, I can't stop feeling so fucking awful. ### Have you tried SADBE? ### I think I’ll try. Stewing in my own misery hasn’t done me any favors so far 💀 ### Time does heal all wounds I guess. I’ve only known for a few days so the wound is still fresh. ### i’m glad you’re doing better! can you lmk some of the podcasts ? ### You will be surprised at how okay they might be about it. When I spoke to some of my friends about it they even mentioned other people they knew who had it. Not their names but just that others had it. It makes you feel less alone and more accepted when they accept that about you too.

I never told my parents about it. It’s not life threatening so didn’t bother. Just my sister, partner and a handful of really close friends.

Then again I found out when I was in my early 30s.

It is up to you if you want to tell them or not. ### I’m too ashamed. The only person in my life that knows is my doctor. ### 18 ### HSV1, anal herpes. ### I promise it gets better I was like you 19 diagnosed with no one knowing about it! Please reach out if you need anything ### Don't forget it doesn't present symptoms in lots of people.  There's a chance that people have it and don't even know. ### They say it’s so common and yet I don’t know a single person except my Ex who has it. Like is it actually that common? ### No, what’s that? ### That’s true. You never really know what each person is going though ### Bro I told all my best friends and all my close relatives. It’s good to have a support system imo. They love you, why would they care about herpes. ### Why the shame? Most people enjoy sex and 67%+ of the world have herpes. ### Let yourself feel, but it’s not the end of the world. I was recently diagnosed as well. You have to remember that it’s hsv1 is extremely common. Your genital hsv1 is no different nor no more shameful than someone else’s oral hsv1 ### Ohhh I understand. Honestly almost every single person on the planet has HSV1. You just have it on a different location on your body that’s literally all that it is!! All your friends/family probably have it n most of them don’t know bc they don’t get symptoms or they got breakouts when they were kids and then just stopped getting them (breakouts get less or disappear overtime). I know you said you got it from casual sex but you would have gotten HSV1 eventually no matter what even if you never had sex. Don’t be hard on yourself I promise it’s okay :) ### Did you get tested once or twice? ### I personally feel like they say it so we don't worry. My doctor almost let it slip that we're basically stuck. But she quickly tried to change the subject. ### Link to the SADBE sub:  www.reddit.com/r/SADBE ### I got from a crappy hookup that I forced myself into doing because I (was) touch starved. (At this point I’ll gladly never have sex again ever if it means I could shake this disease)

So yeah, I’m ashamed. Like if I tell my family I got herpes and they ask how I got it, what would I even say? I love my parents so much and I feel like I failed them. I feel like a terrible role model for my younger siblings.

Herpes is common because of oral HSV1. There’s way too much stigma against those that have genital herpes, even if it’s HSV1. ### Thank you 💗 ### We are actually stuck it seems. Fml ### “I had sex. Sorry, mom, I’m not a virgin anymore.” I can get being ashamed you got it from casual sex, if you and your family believe casual sex with people you’re attracted to is shameful. ### ",20,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tah991/how_am_i_supposed_to_pretend_like_everything_is/

So I waited until a year passed to get retested to get more information. I told my new gyno I have had no symptoms and it’s been a year. And she told me that if I got retested, the results may just make me more confused and with it being over a year and no breakouts it’s probably hsv-1 and since I have no indication it’s ghsv-1 that unless I have a long term sexual relationship I don’t need to mention it unless I want to.

Also, please disclose as apparently you can get sued/ charged by not disclosing (do check your countries law). ### My opinion, you should disclose before any activity is done that can expose the other person to contracting HSV from you. My reason for that is two fold. 

1st, hsv can be mild or severe both physically &/or mentally. Why intentionally expose a person to that?

2nd, would you be ok if someone who has hsv but wouldnt disclose was dating your mom, dad, sister, brother, best friend?

Its not easy. Make it a conversation. Tell them you like them & you cant wait to get them naked but health & safety are important & you want to discuss atd testing history.

See how they react then you can ask their reaults were & from there if their tests included HSV. Then you can explain the reason you ask is that you, like a large percentage of the population have HSV (i dont know if you have 1 & 2 both genitally or one orally & one genitally). If at any point they do not seem mature enough to have this discussion just bounce. ### If you were a guy she would have been passionate about you disclosing immediately... ### My opinion is that you should disclose. I think that doctors giving this advice are negligent ### I was diagnosed during my initial outbreak, after observing and confirming (unprompted) the doctor told me I did not need to disclose to future partners. I was upset to know i had hsv, but honestly shocked she brushed it off so easily. I knew i would want to give people the power to choose and hold myself with integrity.
You have the burden of knowing what many don't, and the privilege of not experiencing the symptoms that cause the real strife of hsv. That makes it less likely to spread, but it still happens.
In the end it's your choice. Imo if someone is asymptomatic and has test results that imply they have hsv, they should share that with their partner. Then if anything is ever feeling off for you, tingly or maybe a bump that looks or feels a little different... you can abstain from sex and protect them until you're sure you're good to go. ### Do unto others as you’d have them do unto you ### Nobody else than yourself can tell you whether you ""need"" to disclose or not. Ultimately, this is a decision you need to do yourself. This is a personal choice that can have permanent consequences for your future sexual partners. 

Some people get life-changing outbreaks, while for others it's not a big deal. While the chances are small, you still have a chance of infecting another person during asymptomatic shedding. 

In an ideal world, you should disclose to any partners before having sex. In reality, most people already have HSV-1. If I understood correctly that you have oral HSV-1, I would personally disclose to someone before engaging in oral sex. ""Hey, just so you know I've had cold sores before, I haven't had them for the past year but I heard it's possible to catch them on genitals too"". ### Do unto others as you’d have them do unto you ### Because men are like 2.5x more likely to pass it? ### As someone who caught it from a woman who did not disclose, I don't think that's a good enough of a reason... ### ",5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tapkrn/gyno_told_me_i_dont_have_to_disclose/
tao6fa,"Putting the responsibility on your partner. The more I think about the best way to go about disclosing to new partners, the more I feel like shifting the pressure to them is best for my own mental health. For example, say you have a connection with someone and want to become sexually intimate; you disclose your diagnosis and they assume they don’t have HSV, but have never actually gotten tested and want to continue the relationship. I feel that at that point, it would be fair to ask them to either get tested or just assume that they already have it. Otherwise, you run the risk of them having an outbreak or testing positive sometime after you’ve had sex and then putting the blame on you for giving it to them. I’m at peace with having this infection and do not feel any shame, so I guess I’m just trying to avoid being in a situation where someone could potentially make me feel guilty after they’ve “accepted” me. Has anyone had experience with anything like this? I’ve been in sexual relationships with men who said they were ok with it, but then would freak out any time they had a blemish that they feared could be an outbreak. Seeing that reaction was such a bummer because I couldn’t help feel like their disgust was also aimed at me. I mean I get it. No one wants this. But to have to witness their horror of potentially getting this is not something I want to expose myself to over and over again.",2,2022-03-09 21:24:31-05:00,"I’m pretty sure that right there is why I will only date others w the same condition.

What are my chances of contracting it? 

Very, very low. Both types of genital herpes pose very low risks of genital-to-oral transmission if no outbreak is present.

Genital hsv1 poses a very low risk of genital-to-oral transmission outside of an active outbreak because genital hsv1 is one of the least active kinds of herpes there is. It very rarely sheds asymptomatically (ie very rarely becomes active on the skin surface without causing actual visible symptoms). Then add to that the fact that the vast majority of exposures to asymptomatic shedding don't result in transmission *anyway*, and you can see the risk is very low. Genital hsv1 poses a very low risk of genital-to-*genital* transmission outside of active outbreaks for the same reason.

Genital hsv2, meanwhile, asymptomatically sheds considerably more frequently than genital hsv1. But hsv2 has a very strong preference for the genital region. Even when it is given the opportunity to infect orally it usually doesn't bother. Oral hsv2 is fairly uncommon. ### Thank you so much for taking the time to explain it like this!!! ### Thank you(: ### >Thank you so much for taking the time to explain it like this!!!

ta88t8,"Girlfriend didn’t disclose she has GHSV2. Hurt and confused. Edit: it is HSV1 and I am immune to that. I had a huge infection as a kid that almost killed me and I think half my blood is HSV1 antibodies. Regardless, the principle of the matter is what hurts me.

My girlfriend of 3 months told me last night she has GHSV2. We have an active sex life without protection. A year ago she said she had some painful bumps come up and she has no idea who it came from. Took an antiviral and it went away and no flare ups since then.

I’m hurt because I would’ve been accepting if she had told me. But my agency in the decision was taken away and I’m trying hard to be able to trust her because I care about her.

Her rationale was that her doctor told her she didn’t have to worry about giving it to anyone so long as she does not have sex during a flare up. I’m the second person she has not disclosed this information to before engaging in sexual activity.

She said she was scared to tell me and that because she knew she couldn’t give it to me she kept it to herself. How can I go about trusting her again? I care about her but I feel like this is a glimpse into her character and I’m not happy with it.",108,2022-03-09 08:53:18-05:00,"My son & his ( new ) GF at the time , both went for as many sti tests together before having sex .  Results at same time .  Problem with hsv it’s not part of standard panel. As much as disclosure is necessary, both parties should be asking if people know their status & actually been tested. Don’t wait to be told or not told. Just like you wouldn’t assume what BC a person is or isn’t taking. ### You literally have herpes and you didn’t disclose. Make it make sense ### Some doctors do tell people things like that. I’m not really sure about how truthful she really is, but if you like her you could give her the benefit of doubt ### I keep seeing you say that this is a big red flag. And it is. But you also didn’t disclose your HSV1. And your HSV1 orally is more contagious than her HSV1 genitally. So it seems incredibly hypocritical to condemn her for not telling you right away, when you did the exact same thing. I’d say you’re even, and holding this against her would be weird when on the principle of the matter you should have disclosed too. Do you consider your actions a big red flag? ### It's a difficult thing to admit on her part, but also kinda shitty. If you're both mature enough to talk it through, having Herpes is not the end of the fucking world and it's easily manageable. I understand if you're feeling hurt, though, so take some time to figure out how you feel about the relationship itself. ### [deleted] ### Are you in the UK? I'm not sure about other countries but basically all my doctors told me I don't need to disclose unless I'm getting into a relationship. Obviously it's difficult to tell sometimes as you could be just hanging with someone a bit, have some sex and then bam, feelings escalate but you've already done the deed and not disclosed... and then what do you do? And it spirals from there.

I always try to disclose now just in case it ever became a relationship. But I've had many battles inside my head like do I actually need to when the doctor told me I don't have to. It really is such a complicated thing. She told you in the end, I think that has to count for something, although I think it is a liiiil bit fucked up that she didn't inform you before going in raw and not being on daily antivirals. ### My first thought was if she didn't think she could transmit it, why was she scared?

My next thought, after reading all the comments, and realizing she has hsv1, and you have hsv1, is that neither of you disclosed, and that since yours is oral, you'd be more likely to transmit than she ever will be.

Of course, neither of you knew any of this, so it means that both of you need to do some research and educate yourselves about your infections, and also likely about other STIs. 

I'd call it even at this point. Don't put more responsibility on her herpes just because it's genital. 

If you care for each other, take it as a learning experience, and move on from it. Be kind to each other. ### had the same thing happen to me and i ended up forgiving that person and dating them for 3 years. i think we (all of us) should be direct when asking for sexual history and it would avoid these awkward disclosures ### I’m actually in the same boat as your girlfriend. I have hsv 1 on my genitals and I didn’t disclose because my doctor ànd the second doctor I asked told me it’s only infectious when I have an outbreak, and I haven’t had an outbreak since the first one 3 years ago, and I honestly basically had forgotten about it. Our first hookup was a very drunken one and we didn’t use a condom (stupid I know) I didn’t really think about it until I read a post a few days ago about herpes on askreddit and it reminded me and sent me in a guilt ridden tailspin.  I’m telling him next time we meet and I am beyond scared. 
I can assure you that apart from this I am a trustworthy, decent, good human being. I love him a lot and I am terrified he will feel betrayed and disgusted, even though there is a huge chance he has hsv1  himself (like most of the world does)  

Ironically I feel some tingling down there now which is either psychosomatic because I’m paranoid, or an actual outbreak in the making because of the stress and the guilt. I hope no-one here hates me, and I mostly hope he doesn’t hate me :(

Edit: This is going to sound weird but I met my boyfriend through his ex-girlfriend who is a close friend of mine.  I just told her about my situation because my anxiety was through the roof and she told me she has cold sores and even sometimes hsv1 in her eye, and she’s pretty sure she has seen him with a cold sore before. So if I understood correctly he is pretty much immune which is probably the biggest relief of my life. I’m still going to tell him and she assured me he won’t make a big deal out of it.  And since he didn’t disclose to me either - not because he’s a jerk but because he probably isn’t aware it could be a big deal, I feel so much less guilty. ### Dr. may have told her that , but i do question a persons lack of any common sense when they choose to believe that or pass that info onto a partner they haven’t disclosed to.  
Does that mean they had sex with someone who had an OB & visible sores ?  Or did they get infected during a period of asymptomatic viral shedding, which they are now telling you that you won’t be infected the exact same way. ### The chances of her passing it by taking antivirals and not having a flare up is literally like 2% a very small chance. And my doctor told me as well just wear condoms. However I’ve never had an outbreak nor have I passed it to anyone. I think I’ve had it for about 4 years and found out years later (long story) but yea this has nothing to do with her character trust me. Dealing with herpes is just a different type of thing mentally. I’m sure she’s an honest girl ### [deleted] ### [removed] ### im really sorry this is happening to you and all other redditors are giving good advice.

 Right now. u are at a cross roads. 

You have an opportunity to turn this into a strengthening moment for a strong foundation or a become weak point and walk away. its your choice. ### You'll hear all sorts of opinions on what is and isn't okay on here. Most of them stem from what people themselves believe and follow. This sub is a small representation of the actual number of people who carry this virus. The only way I found my way here was because i freaked out after my first GHSV2 outbreak and on here is where I discovered the need to disclose and so on  

When I was diagnosed my doctors also told me the same thing: that I don't need to disclose, that I should use condoms and take antivirals and not have sex during a flareup but that was all that was needed. I haven't had a recurrent outbreak since my first one in August so it feels like a small condition to me though I do take the minimum dosage (500 mg) of antiviral daily that might be why 

Imo, if you like her and trust her you can choose to believe that she didn't tell you because she believed her doctor's advice and went with it, as I imagine the vast majority do. I think it's only the smaller percentage of people who do have more symptoms that go to forums looking for advice and help and only then learn that you should be disclosing and so on.  

I personally didn't know herpes was this stigmatized until  I came to this sub. ### You legit already have it and you didn’t disclose ……get over yourself . ### Did u disclose ur hsv? ### With her knowing and not mentioning it, that’s a huge red flag.  Regardless of what her doctor told her, she admits to keeping it from you because she was scared.  Part of relationships is opening up to each other, being vulnerable. ### I don’t agree with not disclosing. While taking daily antivirals and using condoms can lower the risk a lot she cannot say she “can’t give it to you” because that’s that just not true. You don’t have to just be having an outbreak to pass it on to someone. You can be shedding and not know it and then give it to someone 

It’s not okay that she hid this from you. I know it’s scary to have to tell someone but it’s just how it goes since she does have an std. It is just the right thing to do.

She maybe shouldn’t be dating if she hadn’t come to terms with it yet, because lying about this type of thing isn’t okay in my eyes. This is coming from a person who was not told and now has it. And no, having herpes isn’t the end of the world by any means. It’s just the principle that she should have told you in the beginning. That’s a big red flag. ### Well, neither of you disclosed so honestly you're both in the wrong. Up to you to decide whether you want to move forward or not 🤷‍♀️


And before you say ""I didn't know I had to disclose! I was a kid!"" It seems like you were both ignorant to your duty to disclose, and you can't give yourself a pass on that ignorance if you won't give her a pass on it. 


Regardless, you gotta either move on or learn to be ok with it and stay together. Whatever you decide, both of you need to disclose immediately to future partners, you have no excuses now. ### I understand why your upset and I think if anyone knows that there is a risk of transmitting something to someone regardless of how small that risk is they should tell them.  

In saying that no I don’t think your girlfriend is a terrible person at all. Most people with herpes will have sex with someone without disclosing first at least once, especially if they are asymptomatic or rarely get outbreaks. I’ve seen online people sharing stories of how their partner told them years later into a relationship and most of them only did so because they had and outbreak so they had too. Your girlfriend clearly has a conscious if she’s telling you about it when she could so easily just go about her life not telling you. The person I got it from I’m sure knew but just played dumb when I asked him and that’s what a good chunk of people do. ### My time to shine in order to help you. I was this person… hell… I may still be this person. 
It is a glimpse into her character *with this*. Not with all things. She is a bit of a coward with this. I am a bit a of a coward with this. 
But if I’m being honest, which I have no reason to lie, I’d say it is the anomaly in my character because there is just about nothing else I would hide and I suck at hiding this tbh. I have a bad habit of telling the next day. Even when I told one guy ahead of time once and it turned out perfectly fine, I still didn’t tell my next bf until the next day… and he didn’t care. He was in the medical field and already had a lot of information. He could tell I carried shame and honestly made light of it. But it didn’t help for a while… I continued to put sex first with him so he eventually got hurt even though he never got hurt if you catch my drift.
This is a character flaw…. But it may be her only one of its kind.
And I’m sorry people. I’m trying. I recently joined this group to help me get through this crippling fear. I want to be in a relationship and I’m already dreading this conversation when the time comes but I need to grow up and be better. 
Hope this helps OP. ### The doctor gave her medical advice and she followed it. This isn’t a trust issue. As much as it might feel like one. It’s not. ### I didn’t intentionally withhold information. I wasn’t aware oral-genital route was a thing until today. ### My doctor told me I never ever have to tell anyone ### If you were in my shoes what would you do? This is a breach of trust, albeit on a very gray subject matter. I do like her a lot and this is the first red flag. ### I never intentionally withheld information. I didn’t know hsv1 could be transmitted to her genitals. ### She told me on her own accord and admitted it was really shitty. Said she wanted me to like her and that her doctor’s words said it made her feel like the risk of denial on my end wasn’t worth it. I don’t know. Conflicted emotions. People make mistakes but it was selfish of her. ### I actually just called her and it is hsv1. My apologies ### Just fyi, I had ohsv1 and then contracted ghsv1 genitally years later. It’s not at all impossible, just less likely ### So you have had sex and not disclosed? I’m not judging, I want to learn more about this disease and how it affects people who have it. If transmission risk is low and insecurity drives the withholding of info I can be more forgiving of that than someone just wanting sex and not caring who they hurt. ### Good for you. I’m leaning toward forgiveness because no harm no foul but it was shitty and I expect better out of her. ### She doesn’t know where it came from. It is HSV1 so it came from oral sex or spit for lube I assume. She said she never saw any sores on anyone’s face or genitals.

And you are right that is a logical fallacy on her end. Huge one. ### I am heading differing opinions. Some people agree with you that it’s okay fir her to withhold info due to her doctor’s assurance it won’t spread, others say it is selfish and a huge red flag. Not sure what to believe. ### I will. Thanks friend ### “Risked your life?” Fucking get real. Yes his girlfriend was being selfish, but it’s normal to want to believe what medical professionals say. You’re doing nothing but adding stigma to what is at the end of the day a minor ass skin condition that poses no real threat or harm to one’s health. ### I really like her and want to trust her. I don’t believe that she had malicious intent but rather was insecure and thought that the risk of transmission was negligible. She is a good person from what I have seen. But I also think this was extremely selfish. What would you do? ### Thank you for the response. She sincerely said that her doctor told her she will not transmit it if there’s no outbreak. Her doctor also said she should disclose. So I can see how she would be conflicted if there’s “no risk”. It’s a tough thing. It is super stigmatized. ### No. I never really thought about it. I had it as a kid and didn’t know hsv1 can be on genitals. She thought she had hsv2 and didn’t disclose. ### He has hsv1 n isn’t disclosing ### It is a big red flag. I am less upset because it is the herpes I am likely immune to but the principal of the matter is that she did not disclose and thought it was HSV2 until this morning when I made her call the doctor. ### And let me take it a bit further… it may also be an issue or self love and self loathing. She will probably have a difficult time loving you if she doesn’t fully love herself yet. ### But u ok risking kissing n transferring? U outta pocket bruh. U need check ### You’re uninformed, and you’re mad at her for also being uninformed? I was infected by someone like you with oral hsv1. Disclose in the future. ### I can’t tell because I don’t know anything about this relationship. I do believe even with sever breach of trust you can make a comeback but it depends on whether she will own up. 
This is what I think might be a way forward but I’m in no way an expert:
You have a different criteria about transparency in a relationship than her it seems. You might have to at least clear that up and let her know how you feel about it. I think the way commutate is important, let her know HSV is not the dealbreaker but lack of transparency and honesty is. ### But you knew it could still be spread to someone’s oral region? Why is it that you’d be okay with giving someone oral herpes and not disclosing that? That’s the double standard I’m pointing out ### So you have herpes too?? Does she know that? Granted, I still get, I see the difference but yeah… no you should be telling people that cuz it sounds like you could pass it to someone. Idk though ask your doctor. ### Some doctors do see herpes as no big deal. Some say there is a duty to disclose. Its a tough one. Many people are just like 'whatever' about these things and others take it much more seriously. ### [deleted] ### Did you have oHSV-1 since childhood or acquired later in life? ### I don't think I disclosed one time last year when I was incredibly drunk, I didn't really remember much about having sex or getting down to it or anything as I suffer blackouts frequently when drinking.. but when we woke up the next day he never mentioned it which makes me think I didn't. And how horrible I felt about it afterwards just wasn't worth it to me so I vowed to never let it happen again! I've been very open about it with other people. Only one person so far has treated me like a leper. ### In your edit you mention you knowingly had HSV1, did you disclose this before kissing her? Then you're ragging on her for not disclosing even though you have it to and didn't disclose.

Pretty funny. And yes, I know that you thought it was hsv2, but it's different strains of the same virus. Please explain how you can justify your reaction. ### you cant really expect much out of someone you knew for 3 months thats kinda what got you in this situation to begin with. 

be more upfront and disregard your expectations

ask direct questions, dont expect anyone to do anything

edit: also dont use this as leverage or try to hold it over her head. if you think its shitty and are truly bothered by it, move on. otherwise it doesnt make you any better than her ### Oral sex is usually the route. Saliva may have some viral load but it’s a skin to skin transmission virus so the viral load of saliva , especially with no active OB wouldn’t likely be enough. ### That is also no true for everyone .  Dangerous to new born if mother has an OB at the time of delivery. And recently it was in UK news of a Dr. Infecting 2 women who both died soon after giving birth. Minor skin irritation to some , not all , incl. those who have frequent OB and have trouble walking , urinating etc. ### What would you do if you were in my shoes? ### I think you have a good outlook on this situation. Not everyone is perfect. From what your comments say, it seems as though she feels guilty about it and realizes it was wrong. As someone who has not disclosed to another person before, it was something I was able to say was 100% my fault and did out of fear/shame/belief that knowing it probably won’t transmit if I’m taking the precautions. I owned up to it, have learned from it, and since then I always disclose. And I’d like to think I’m a decent person.

You can think what she did was selfish and still find the good within her. If you don’t think she did it maliciously, and if she brought it up on her own and owned up to the selfish behavior, I think it’s fair to say that she deserves another chance. It just depends on how much you like her and if you’ll be able to rebuild that trust. You also don’t owe it to her to force yourself to forgive her if that’s not what you think you’ll be able to do. Things like that take time, though, so don’t expect to know exactly what you want to do right this instant. Good luck :) ### That's probably what she was truly told, it's not a serious virus for most people and that's the typical stance that most medical professionals have 

It is a tough thing, you should talk to her about it and make sure she understands how you feel. Take some time to just process and feel all your feelings. ### And u didn’t disclose. U did the same thing she did. I have ghsv1 because people like u. Or I was a kid oh I don’t think about it. U can give hsv1 to private areas n hsv2. Leave her b. Y’all literally have the same thing. Hypothetically a bit don’t u think ### U never did either. So she has hsv1 because y’all that’s been infected don’t say nothing. U should be ashamed of urself ### Exactly. Cold sores are transmissible anywhere. OP should’ve disclosed before he kissed her ### Who hurt you ### I know that it can but it was so long ago I forgot it was even a thing. ### That’s true. It is super common and there is a stigma. However that doesn’t mean she is relieved from the responsibility of telling me. Tough decision on my end. ### My doctor didn’t give me any direction at all. I don’t even think I got a pamphlet. It was like, “yeah this is herpes,” tears start coming and they dipped. ### Dope ### I’m positive I had it from late childhood or early teens, but I can’t remember the exact age. I got it genitally when I was almost 18. The nurse told me it was rare that I contracted ghsv-1, like a one in ten chance. ### I didn’t think about it. I didn’t knowingly violate her agency. ### He has herpes n he ain’t disclosing either cuz he had it since a kid. He’s a problem too ### I got it from receiving oral. Definitely no visible sores. ### Thank you. I like her and think it was the result of fear of being found disgusting and a belief it was nearly impossible to transmit. It was wrong but I think I will be able to forgive her due to her bringing it up on her own and apologizing saying she fucked up and feels horrible. That’s better than hiding it and me wondering how I got herpes. That would be malicious. ### Thank you. I appreciate your kind words. ### The difference is I never had it on my genitals, knew it was hsv1, and nobody told a 10 year old to disclose it before oral sex. She was told that and also thought it was hsv2. You are right it never crossed my mind but nobody told me to disclose my oral herpes. She was told to disclose her genital herpes. ### You are a mindless scab aren’t you ### He’s thinks he shouldn’t have too. He thinks he can’t spread herpes. He this hsv2 is the only herpes that matters. The boof bag doesn’t know hsv1 infection rate on the genital area is higher than hsv2 in 2022. Boof bag should just delete the whole thread n sit in a corner ### [deleted] ### A crappy person just like u. Not disclosing n blaming others ### A lot of people feel their way about their genital herpes, I forget I have it a lot, soooooooo ### so many people forget! i’m sure she did too bc she’s not having a flare up so why would she be thinking of it daily? don’t make it a big deal. you both didn’t disclose so i would call it even and not hold it over her head especially since you had it longer and didn’t say anything either. you both know the truth now so just move on ### Just try to be gentle on her, even if you decide things won't work out. The burden of responsibility can be quite heavy for some people and adding guilt and blame to that is enough to drive anyone mental. Take it from me. Anyways, don't let it get to you and count your blessings in life! Good luck with everything 👍 ### [deleted] ### I asked because you could have autoinnoculated yourself around the same time, within the 4 month period and were initially asymptomatic genitally? Never heard/read of anyone who has had oral HSV since childhood and spread it to themselves years later, but there's still a small possibility I guess.

Some cases I have read on here were all adult infections that got it genitally/in the fingers a few years later which made doubt whether the autoinnocuation was recent, or simply they had been asymptomatic in that location before. The other cases I've read from peer reviewed studies were all about people who autoinnoculated themselves shortly after the initial infection, in childhood or adulthood. ### Are you looking to be mad at her?

She didn't knowingly violate yours, either. Her doctor told her not to worry about it. 

Did you ask for STI testing before having sex? Talk about STIs at all? Mention herpes? Anything? 

Either let it go or don't. If you have a good relationship so far, I'd suggest letting it go. Effectively, you did the same thing to each other, though one could argue yours was worse since you are more infectious. But no one wins the blame game - just let it go. ### OP is a POS piece of shit then ### Are u forgiving her because u want to forgive her.. or because you found out u have hsv1 and ""immune"" to it? 

though the schematics don't matter, you need to understand that NO ONE is malicious enough to WANT to infect another person on purpose. (besides. u actually can get sued if you did) 

btw. not true. you technically still can get ghsv1 even if u have oshv1. just its slim. ### Just saw your edit saying you had HSV1 already, I don't think you have any ground to hold this over her at all seeing as you yourself also did not disclose that you have Oral HSV1 which is the most contagious form of that virus. Her GHSV1 will likely never transmit to anyone. ### U should be disclosing! SO U CANT BE MAD U DOING THE SAME SHIT ### Bro there isn’t a difference. I literally have hsv1 because my ex has cold sores since a kid n didn’t say shit. So miss me with the bs ### Google works ### U can transfer hsv1 anywhere. JUST FROM A KISS. ### Ur brain doesn’t seem to work properly for u to think what u did was ok n what she did was wrong bro. Like come on make it make sense ### Boof bag 🤣 ### Absolutely. I agree 100% it’s just a skin condition but unfortunately this is the exact reason why ghsv1 is a rise now a days. People aren’t fucking disclosing. If people with hsv1 disclosed then hsv2 wouldn’t be such a big deal. That’s why it’s so stigmatized ### I guess I am lucky it’s the same virus I am immune to. And I will be gentle. Life is messy and I could imagine that disclosing that information would really suck for someone especially with how stigmatized it is. ### Still though she should have told me ### Her doctor told her not to have sex during an outbreak and that it’s no big deal. But also to disclose before sex. ### Agreed. ### I understand that but I was never made aware I could transmit that to someone via sex. She thought she had hsv2 and still had sex with me knowing she could spread it. I didn’t know. ### I haven’t had a cold sore since I was 10. I almost died because of it. My whole esophagus and stomach were riddles with coldsores. ### I feel bad that you have trauma regarding this subject. I really do. Screaming at someone who has legitimate concerns won’t make you feel better. I wish you luck. ### [deleted] ### she should have, but i know most people with oHSV1 dont disclose, or even know they should. gHSV1...i really dont know. its shitty, but very unlikely to cause problems. gHSV2 here & my doc said i could have sex whenever, with no mention of condoms, when i had one small bump. doctors get this stuff wrong all the time. i'd be curious if she did her own research on it and judge her intelligence level pretty harshly if not. if its just emotional turmoil, i really dont know what i'd do. disclosing is hard; ask yourself, does she often shy away from difficult things? ### You answered none of my questions. 

In your original post, you said, ""her doctor told her she didn’t have to worry about giving it to anyone so long as she does not have sex during a flare up.""

You mention nothing about her doctor telling her to disclose. You also don't mention that anywhere else in this thread.

Did you ask her about STIs? About herpes? About anything before having sex? You both should have disclosed.

If you can't let it go, let her go. ### It doesn’t matter u still have herpes. N have for a long time. Superspreader ### U can hear through a screen? Y u think u are exempt from disclosing? ### So when do you think hsv1 should be disclosed? ### Damn. I’m sorry you are taking this post personal. I was asking for advice for a confusing situation. ### I hope you feel better. ### I'm not taking it personally - nothing in it applies to me. I was disclosed to from the beginning, I got it 6 years later, and don't resent him at all. 

I have disclosed always, and have been successful all but one time. I've had hsv2 for almost 20 years. 

All I'm saying is that you aren't answering questions that could imply that you carry some fault here, too. If you aren't having the conversation about STIs, that's on you, too. If you asked her, ""Do you have anything?"" and she said, ""no"", that's a lie. If you didn't ask, and she didn't tell because she didn't think she could transmit, there's more gray area there.

Also, again, you didn't disclose. 

It's not actually all that confusing. You asked for advice, and you keep coming back with reasons to be mad at her. That's fine - your call. Some of us just don't agree, or see it differently than you seem to want to. ### Start disclosing n make the world a better place ### ",21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/ta88t8/girlfriend_didnt_disclose_she_has_ghsv2_hurt_and/

talrho,Chance of infection Chance of infecting partner if they fuck me without a condom and I have no visible sores and am on valacyclovir?!,7,2022-03-09 19:20:39-05:00,"Is this penis in vagina sex? Anal sex? Do you have type 1 or type 2? 

Assuming you have a vagina, and your partner has a penis, and this is penis in vagina sex, the chances are really low. 

We don't have stats for a one time encounter, or for ghsv1, but for ghsv2, if you are in a relationship, and you have a vagina, and your partner has a penis (using parts here, your gender identities are your own), and you don't have sex when you have symptoms, and are on suppression, and average sex 2-3x a week, there is a 2% chance a year your partner would get it.

This assumes your partner knows, and you avoid sex with any symptoms.

Ghsv1 transmission rates are assumed to be much lower because it sheds less and recurs less often. 

If this isn't a long term partner whose STI status you know, you might want to talk about STIs, because you could get what they have - chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, HIV, etc., because you didn't use a condom. ### I am a guy and he’s my boyfriend. I’m a bottom… ### I'm sorry, unfortunately we do not have stats for same sex transmission. Or anal sex. It's dreadful. 

Do you know what type you have? You can have genital type 1 or 2, and the chances of transmitting are really different. 

Anal sex transmission would probably be a bit higher because of less lubrication, but that's an assumption. 

I wish I had definitive info for you. ### I do not know what type I have unfortunately. Is there any way to find out without a blood test? We use a lot of lube so hopefully it’s not a abrasive. ### You could get an outbreak typed to find out. Are you unable to get a blood test for some reason? Are they unavailable where you are?

Has your partner ever tested? Does he know you have it? ### Yeah I can’t afford it. My bf knows, only ever done safe. ### So yeah, testing can be expensive, but there are places that you can get it done cheaply-ish. 

What I'd suggest, since you are on a budget, is to do a type 2 test only. The hsv1 test misses 30% of infections, so if you do an hsv2 test only, and it's neg, then you know it's hsv1, right? 

So if you're in the US, try one of these -

I looked into suppressive therapy for HSV. Which is a daily dose of valtrex or similar meds. Says it reduces the risk of asymptomatic shedding and the duration and frequency of outbreaks.

tacexp,"A positive (no pun intended) update from the girl who self-proclaimed addiction to casual sex. My post last month got a lot of responses, so thanks to everyone for your kindness and even your jokes. 

One of my partners tested after me and turns out they have HSV1, very established with antibodies in the 20s. Very unlikely that they passed it to me from our first encounter and the symptoms started showing that soon so I’m not blaming them for anything at all. 

In fact, this whole experience has trapped me in a Too Hot to Handle situation that I didn’t want but opened my eyes to how stigmatized this virus is for no reason. I was worried sick, my partner as well, and eventually we just didn’t worry too much about it. If it’s there, so be it, and I am convinced that there’s no way the love of my life (…whether this turns out to be my current partner or not…) will turn me down because of HSV or potential HSV. 

Hopefully I can get clear answers from a blood test in the next months but either way the projected end of my sex life does not seem that likely. Turns out, I also like noncasual sex - that is to say, extremely formal with business attire and all.

Try tapering off if you’re going to do that. Could try adding lysine to your intake too. ### I've heard that some people like to be especially careful with taking meds, since they believe that they can upset their immune system. As far as I am aware and based on what Terri Warren has said - there is no evidence that taking antivirals leads to antiviral resistance or other health concerns in the long term. In other words, they're safe to take for life and I don't think this is a case that your body has become resistant to the antivirals.

HPV can take a long time for your body to fight off and clear from your system. Depending on the strain this might be months of possibly over a year. I suspect your immune system is busy handling the hpv and the hsv is taking advantage whilst it's weak and vulnerable. 

Could you try talking to your doctor about switching up to a more potent antiviral such as famciclovir? You might do better on something other than valtrex, weirdly for some valcyclovir and acyclovir sometimes don't work all that well.

Also there's little academic evidence to support it, but a lot of people say they noticed a reduction in outbreaks after taking daily supplements of l-lysine and red marine algae. ### I wasn’t taking them every day until i started getting reoccurring BOs.

I have no bumps sores or lesions. I dont even know if I have an OB. The area just feels weird. Sore and raw and a bit itchy. I hope it's just because of the yeast infection. She prescribed Acyclovir anyways and I guess I'm gong to take it and see what happens. I really just hope it's not an OB. She did say that there is no correlation between yeast infections causing OBs though. ### ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tabwti/trying_not_to_panic/

tabrf2,"When fooling around with my gf; I’m too conscious that she has HSV2 and it’s difficult to get a hard on I’m (40M) dating an extraordinary, sexy woman (41F) and she has HSV2. We’ve been together for 2 months. She shared this with me before anything happened and she has been very open with me about the topic. I don’t want to dig in more about it with her, because I know it’s difficult for her, as she gets frustrated when she starts feeling an itch.

I’ve always been of the worrying/overthinking type of not getting any STD/STI, but being honest, I didn’t know much about Herpes, as I thought it was “always there” and you would see it before getting laid with someone. She encouraged me to do my own research and now I know how mistaken I was.

When fooling around; I struggle getting a hard on, because I’m too conscious that I have to be extra careful to not get it and I’m always thinking of what I do with the fingers I used to finger her or the fact that I MUST wear a condom, otherwise, I could get it. One side of my brain is having sex, the other one is just thinking about all the precautions I need to be taking. I’ve always enjoyed is going down on my partner, but she discourages this. She loves how I use my fingers, but prefers penetration.

Any suggestions on how can I be less worried or just let myself go in the moment as with other partners before?

I think it's less than a 10% chance. It's even less in asymptomatic people (when there are not symptoms).

An example, my boyfriend has accepted it because I helped him understand the statistics. We don't have any trouble in the bedroom and simply refrain from sex if I am symptomatic. He hasn't caught it (that I know of) and we've been together a long time. But that brings me to another point. There are many people out there with hsv that are not even aware they have it. You actually have less of a chance of getting it from someone who is diagnosed because they are medicated and careful than you have with someone unknowingly carrying and shedding the virus.

Also, it's really quite rare for the virus to cause serious health problems, especially in healthy people. It's not really that big of a deal for the majority of people who get it. 

Sounds like you have a lovely relationship and she sounds beautiful. Having an open conversation may be difficult but i think it may actually help you both feel more comfortable so it might be time to ease into that. Good luck ♡ ### yeah OP condoms do not prevent you from getting herpes. but i will say this

you have a lower chance of getting herpes from someone who knows they have herpes than you are outside a relationship

She was thankfully super accepting and I’m really grateful for it. Tbh I feel like I’m kinda lucky (this is the first time I’ve ever had to disclose due to recent diagnosis). But I’d suggest other guys to have the talk with their future partners with confidence. Let your partner know you care about their health and that’s why you’d like to disclose ### Finally a dude saying he had a positive disclosure conversation.  Before I even opened this thread I knew it was a female saying she had a glorious time telling someone she had herpes. Believe me.

That doesn’t change the fact that nearly every thread here and on Facebook expressing wonderful experiences and marriage proposals is always a female. ### [deleted] ### Except for the one immediately above 🫣, women typically like to communicate more and are more prone to seek support imo ### This is so full of projection and your own take on things with very little fact.

There are so many variables to making disclosure successful which you are totally ignoring here. Yes, I agree with you that in general it is the man in our society who has to chase the woman, and its generally the woman who decides if the relationship is on. The girl chooses the guy (generally). But the emotional stress of disclosure, especially the first disclosure, is no less terrifying for a positive female than for a positive male since they cannot read the future or guarantee how their partner will react. There are also women who are in fact rejected because of their hsv, they do exist.

You have two individuals posted immediately above who have confirmed, as men, that they have had positive disclosures - with one having only ever had positive disclosure experiences (3 times). Like him, I also have only ever been accepted for it, never been rejected for hsv. And I would wager that it didn't take them 6 months to say it either!!! In my experience I wait until the 3rd date, that's my decision date and that's generally enough time to work out if I think the girl I'm dating is kind and can handle disclosure maturely.

Have you considered that perhaps men don't tend to most here because typically men get less severe symptoms than women when it comes to herpes? Or that the nature of the ""women need to be wooed"" society we have, means that women in particular suffer from the effects of fearing the label of ""damaged goods"" (in much the same way women are under more pressure not to sleep around and be labelled as a slut)? Or that women are generally a bit more social and conscientious and willing to share their experiences to support others, whereas men tend to struggle with sharing feelings publicly?

Have you also considered that perhaps there's a method to disclosure that maybe you haven't quite nailed yet? Are you doing it in person versus over text? And most importantly, are you choosing the right women to disclose to, or are you choosing to disclose to immature, judgemental and just generally not-very-interested-in-you women?

I think you need to stop blaming this on the difference of the sexes. Its perfectly possible to have great disclosure experiences as a man. Dig deep, be honest with yourself and look at what you may learn from your experiences and what they can tell you beyond ""women have it so easy"". 

This completely backward and dishonest sort of message is damaging to the many men out there who read these posts, who already have a negative outlook on life after their diagnosis, and who then become even more dejected and anxious as a result, based on not much more than hot air.

Men have just as much reason to be optimistic about dating with hsv as women do. ### that’s true. The other thing is I went to the Facebook group for herpes and it’s literally 95% females. 

That can’t be a coincidence. Part of me wonders if guys just are far less likely to have symptoms. 

I’m very into sociology and topics like this so there’s something incredibly strange about the fact that the Facebook group is almost all women. 

And I don’t think it’s just because they tend to seek support more. They might, but I don’t think that accounts for the insane lopsidedness. ### [deleted] ### But that's not all you're saying though is it? I mean, go back and read what you said for starters. No one is denying there are differences in dating between men and women. You need only go on any dating app and compare the amounts of swipes and matches men get compared to women. Not that you even mentioned that, but it's a fact - hence my agreement with your statement that in general women get to pick their mate and so, as a result, are going to end up with a wider pool of potential suitors. No one is saying that dating isn't hard or that dating is fair. It's not. Nor has anyone said that having hsv makes dating less difficult. We were talking explicitly about hsv here and you're doom mongering by saying that it doesn't work like this for men; which is just too much of a generalisation and by extension not accurate.

The hypocrisy of you criticising me for using real world examples and directing you to the experiences beyond your own, from other men, is pretty evident when your opening statement is: 'I know at least four or five girls in real life who have HSV2. Oh the stories they have about guys eager to have sex with him. A couple have even had marriage proposals.'

Your example of taking 1000 men and 1000 women would work exactly the same for counting matches on tinder. What do you mean by a massive difference in success? What percentage are we talking here? Do you have a number? Because if you don't, unlike tinder where we can literally see examples of men vs women swipes and matches, that doesn't sound like facts to me, it sounds like making up a random statistic based on... well, your own biased projections.

'I told one girl and she laughed at me and said “that’s what you get!“. Others are polite and then disappear.' You're extrapolating your experience to the entire male population with hsv trying to find a girlfriend. Which is inaccurate. And you didn't mention if you've ever had positive disclosure or not to even give a sense of balance to that statement. That is what I am pointing out.

'The dynamic isn’t even remotely the same for guys.'
The dynamic is extremely similar, if you read people's experiences on here, its all the same stuff that comes up, again and again. The same concerns and the same methods of disclosure that are most likely to lead to success regardless of gender. I agree that there will be gender differences, just as there are in ""normal"" dating - it's a numbers game after all especially regarding apps - but the extreme to which you are taking those differences is the issue.

'The only chance guys have, is to not say anything, and allow deep emotions to grow in the girls heart first. And somehow make excuses for why you “don’t want to have sex yet”.'
This is just totally inaccurate. Many of the statements ""of fact"" you make, are sweeping generalisations which, I'm sorry, are just wrong. It might be the case for you, sure, but cannot be used to describe how negative the experience will be for every other man reading this post, when plenty of men have posted positive experiences to refute this. There have even been posts on this sub by swingers; a community of people who literally get together to have sex from day one with no emotional connection, who do so happily and successfully with hsv positive male partners despite alternatives being on offer.

Note your choice of language: 'the only chance guys have' - that's utter rubbish and as already mentioned, the 3 guys posting success above your post does, contrary to your opinion, prove that. I.e. it's not the only chance guys have. Of course an emotional connection helps - it would be pretty ballsy for anyone on their first date to be like ""Hey! So good to meet you - btw I have herpes!"". Having a good rapport is of course going to help, but pretending that 'deep emotions grow in girls heart first' is the only way, is just too much hyperbole. 

And then you made some weird statement about not having sex for 6 months? Again, disproven by those who have had success not doing it this way. 

You also mention hot women posting?? Most of the women and men who post here are completely anonymous - what makes you think that they're hot women? That in itself is an example of projection on your part.

If you can't see the above, I'm sorry. 

I'll say again; there's a lot of projection in your post and as someone interested in sociology surely you must be aware of the blatant confirmation bias. The issue is not that you have experienced what you have or that your experiences are not valid (because they absolutely are), it's that you take your experience and generalise it to most men with sweeping statements, which is simply not true. ### [deleted] ### You're projecting again - I don't think you aren't intelligent at all, just that you were wrong in the generalisations that you made.

'men do not have the same success rate with disclosure as women do. That’s what I said.' - no, that is not the extent of what you said.

If I thought you were not intelligent I wouldn't bother responding to you and debating.

I meant no personal offence to you, and I apologise if I caused any. I think it's important to speak about these things as we see them, because I think it has the ability to help others who read these posts. 

Take care. ### ",71,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/t9pmzv/theres_hope_out_there_yall/

This is unclear. You're saying you ""were tested positive for hsv2 for awhile now"", so it sounds like you were tested some time ago, but you're also saying ""I just got the news 3 days ago"". So what news are you referring to? If not the positive hsv2 diagnosis?

>Even eating with my family or anyone is hard(they know) . Having to constantly remind myself I am hsv 2 positive , I have to be protective of my food and make sure I don't cross contaminate the food , I do laundry separate from them .

Sorry, what?

Okay, let's back up a few steps here.  If you have genital hsv2 then it shouldn't impact your interactions with your family at *all*. It cannot be transmitted via sharing food or drinks, or via laundry, or anything like that. Nor can it be transmitted by kissing people. If you have genital hsv2 then a person's mouth or genitals would need to have direct skin-to-skin contact with your genitals for there to be any potential risk of transmission at all. That's it. If you have genital hsv2 then the only people at any potential risk of transmission are sexual partners having direct contact with your genitals.

Herpes expert Terri Warren does advise people with genital herpes infections to not share their bath towels with others if they are having an active outbreak, because the warmth and moisture in the towel might theoretically be able to sustain the virus for a short period of time and pose a risk to someone else using it shortly afterward, but she expects that risk to be extremely low. Beyond that, inanimate objects generally pose no transmission risk whatsoever. Herpes virus dies off very quickly on inanimate objects/surfaces. So things like toilet seats pose no risk of herpes transmission. The same goes for a shared bar of soap in the shower.

Here is the blurb I regularly post about inanimate objects. It is more focused on oral herpes, but will still give you a general sense of things:

---

Herpes expert Terri Warren, who has a 35+ year career researching and treating herpes specifically, has repeatedly stressed that herpes *cannot* be transmitted via drinking straws, cups, utensils, cigarettes/joints/bongs, shared food items, or inanimate objects in general. Herpes is a very fragile virus that cannot live long outside the body and requires both moisture and warmth to survive. Also, a certain *volume* of virus is required in order to cause an infection. A small trace amount is insufficient. Terri has stated that the only inanimate objects that pose any practical risk of *oral* transmission are lipsticks / chapsticks / lip gloss because the particular properties of these items can sometimes sustain the virus for short periods and they can sometimes be used by another person immediately after someone who might be contagious. Similarly, she has stated that the only inanimate objects that pose any risk for *genital* transmission are shared sex toys that, again, might be used by another person immediately after a person who is infected. She also advises people with genital infections to not share bath towels *when they are having an outbreak*, but expects the risk of transmission in this manner to still be extremely unlikely.

Here is one such quote from Terri on her clinic forum where she addresses the issue and responds to someone asking about potential transmission from sharing a phone:

>the only inanimate objects I am at all concerned about are sex toys and lipsticks. We do advise individuals not to share warm moist towels, but even transmission in this way is extremely unlikely. The phone is not the kind of contact that transmits herpes. There has to be more contact than that. To acquire herpes, there is a certain amount of virus that need to be present and it is not a tiny amount. I guess if a person had a big cold sore and was rubbing their cold sore actively into the phone and then the next person came up immediately afterwards and started putting the phone in their mouth, there might be a 1% chance of transmission. It just doesn’t happen this way.

([Source](https://www.westoverheights.com/forum/question/mouth-outbreaks-and-transmission-through-phone-sharing/))
  
And here's another example where a client wrote:

>Scenario: My friend has large and frequent cold sores. I was visiting her for coffee and when she was making the coffees she licked and sucked the spoon she was using and then used the spoon to scoop the milk froth on top of my coffee (did not stir). She had a healing cold sore (scab had fallen off). I was worried but too polite to say anything, so waited 5 minutes before drinking my coffee trying to avoid the froth.

>The next day I woke up with a sore throat, slight sniffles and light headedness (but I also had a cold/allergies last week). My top lip felt funny but it could have been in my imagination due to being paranoid or just dry. I got Zovirax and put it on just in case.

And Terri replied:

>Someone else on here asked a similar question today but with soup instead of coffee. My answer is the same – a million to one chance that you would contract herpes in this way.

>I don’t know why medical websites say that honestly. There is just no evidence in the scientific literature to say that this is true and I’m totally a science based clinician. Perhaps it is because people go into their providers and say “I ate hot soup that my friend made who gets cold sores and now I have one”. Of course, we can’t extrapolate that because someone who has cold sores did something and now you have one, you got it from them. The only inanimate object that I worry about for transmission of oral herpes is sharing lipsticks. Lipsticks and lip gloss stay moist and if someone with active oral virus uses lipstick immediately before someone else, that is a possibility for transmission. That’s why cosmetic counters no longer allow testing with the actual lipstick and now use surrogates, like q tips.

So again, if a person has genital herpes, the only thing it would potentially impact is their interactions with their sexual partners. It would not require any changes whatsoever to the manners in which they interact with their family or friends. None whatsoever.

It sounds like a large part of your distress has been the result of some major misunderstandings on your part. So, hopefully this marks an important turning point in your recovery. ### Well the good news is you are in the same group as many gay and bisexual men. Upwards of 30-50% by some studies so you are not alone. Genital herpes might not be curable but it is very treatable and if all you had during your first outbreak(usually the worst outbreak) was a mild breakout that means you probably won't have too much trouble with physical symptoms. If outbreaks are bothering you, you can always take some antivirals and they will go away and if it becomes consistent or if you would like to lessen your chances of shedding the virus you can go on daily antiviral suppressive therapy and it will cut your chances of spreading the virus by 50%(condoms also cut the chances by 50% so if are in suppressive therapy and condoms you could make it to having a less than 2% chance of ever transmitting the virus)

Now here's the hard part, the stigma. There is an irrational fear of herpes brought on by our puritanical sex negative culture and big pharma manufacturing the stigma to sell antivirals and ointment. Unfortunately, when alot of people hear the word herpes their first instinct is to run away. Now whether you choose to disclose or not is entirely up to you. I choose to disclose because that's what I would have wanted but I don't judge people who choose not to disclose. 80-90% of the people who have genital herpes have no idea that they have it and they never disclose so it is unfair to say the people who happen to know they have herpes have a responsibility to disclose or they are terrible people. It is entirely your choice on whether you want to disclose or not. If you choose to disclose there may be some people turned off by that and that's okay. There may be some people who think you're tall for them, too short for them, they don't like your laugh, they don't like the way you chew etc. People reject each other for a myriad of reasons and there's no reason to take it personally. In my experience as a man who has sex with men most guys  just want to know how I got it and their chances of getting it from me. If they are attracted to you it would rarely stop things. All you have to do is take care of yourself, disclose confidently and you should be fine. 

Also it's unfortunate that there isn't alot of scientific literature on herpes virus in MSM but it's safe to assume that you are less likely to transmit to anguy if you are the bottom just based off female to male transmission being so much lower. 

One thing to remember is that you have herpes, not cooties or leprosy or polio. Most things you do will not put anybody at risk besides skin to skin contact of any infected area(AKA your genitals AKA sexual contact). Cuddling with your bestie, sharing food, laundry etc poses a 0% risk of transmission. There is no way everyday activity will transmit the virus. Honestly I suggest therapy because I know how hard it is to get your self esteem back after a diagnosis like this but remember you are not alone. More people in the world have at least one of the types of herpes than people who are herpes free. There is nothing wrong with you, you got unlucky and now have a skin condition similar to eczema or psoriasis that overtime will rarely show because your immune system will know how to fight it. 

I think you should talk to your friend. I was embarrassed to talk to mine but you'd be surprised at how understanding they are. I really do wish you the best of luck and I know you will get through this ### I'm really glad to know that objects won't pass the virus (except for sex toys in my case). Sorry for the misunderstanding. I only got the news 3 days ago that I am positive, and I was unaware until 3 days ago.

I am however confused. You said that if I had hsv 2 so that means my genital must have a skin to skin contact to transfer. And you pointed out ""nor can it be transmitted by kissing people."" Were you talking about a French kiss or just a peck?

  I did my research myself and I heard hsv 1 can get from mouth  to genital and have can go from the genitals to the mouth . Is that true or false?.

And Once again, thank you so much! ### >I'm really glad to know that objects won't pass the virus (except for sex toys in my case).

And only if someone else were to use the same sex toy immediately after, or very shortly after you. If it's been laying on the bed for an hour then it would pose no risk.

>I am however confused. You said that if I had hsv 2 so that means my genital must have a skin to skin contact to transfer. And you pointed out ""nor can it be transmitted by kissing people."" Were you talking about a French kiss or just a peck?

No matter what kind of kiss you were to give someone else, it would pose zero transmission risk. Because your mouth is not infected. Only your genitals are infected.

>I did my research myself and I heard hsv 1 can get from mouth to genital and have can go from the genitals to the mouth . Is that true or false?.

Yes. In fact, the vast majority of genital hsv1 infections are the result of receiving oral sex from a partner who had oral hsv1. But transmission in the other direction, genital-to-oral, is very low risk for *both* types of genital herpes (so long as no outbreak is present).

Genital hsv1 poses a very low risk of genital-to-oral transmission outside of an active outbreak because genital hsv1 is one of the least active kinds of herpes there is. It very rarely sheds asymptomatically (ie very rarely becomes active on the skin surface without causing actual visible symptoms). Then add to that the fact that the vast majority of exposures to asymptomatic shedding don't result in transmission *anyway*, and you can see the risk is very low. Genital hsv1 poses a very low risk of genital-to-*genital* transmission outside of active outbreaks for the same reason.

Genital hsv2, meanwhile, asymptomatically sheds considerably more frequently than genital hsv1. But hsv2 has a very strong preference for the genital region. Even when it is given the opportunity to infect orally it usually doesn't bother. Oral hsv2 is fairly uncommon. At *least* 95% of all hsv2 infections are genital.

>Thank you for helping me understand more about hsv too! It means a lot to me

I had sex with a friend who is hsv 2 positive about two weeks and was as careful as possible, she wasn’t having an outbreak, and we basically took turns touching each other (we both have vulvas) but still ended up with some suspicious bumps around my genital area and feeling sick about a week later, SO, I got tested this Monday. It was the test where the sore is swabbed and they send it away to be cultured, from other peoples experience, how long did it take to get your results back?

I’m going to retest again just wanted opinions on how to interpret these results",12,2022-03-09 06:18:21-05:00,"your positive for hsv1 and negative for hsv2. flr hsv1 you could have oral or genital herpes, or both, you need to watch yourself and see if you have any outbreaks on your mouth or gential ### with test results like these and zero symptoms i would literally just forget about it and go on with life.   you have nothing to stress about.  keep your vitamin D levels above 30 and relax in the knowledge that most people you date will also be carrying type 1 asymptomatically. ### Ok, because I haven’t had a hookup with anyone in about 4 months and I’ve never had any symptoms. Is it possible it’s a false positive and if it isn’t,is there really any need to retest? ### Solid hsv1. If you have never had symptoms then could be either location , probably oral.  
Hsv2 if no partners for last 4 mo, then neg. Only 8% chance of false neg with igg after that amount of time. ### some people don’t have symptoms or outbreaks as well, if you don’t have outbreaks, it’s less likely that you will transmit it to someone. just keep eating healthy, living healthy, have a clean gut, you can probably get rid of it too. ### Ok so the hsv1 is positive and the hsv2 is negative? If so would you recommend retesting for the hsv1? ### What do you mean by get rid of it ?  Rid your body of the virus ? ### No what would be the point ? The false positives you read about are mainly hsv2 and with results of 3.5 and under

If it came out negative then it would likely be one of the 30% of false negatives that the igg is known to have. 

If you want another test then it would be , take no antivirals and pay for the Western Blot. Only one place that does it. 

With about 7O % of population being hsv1 positive & most of us asymptomatic , we are not the minority .  Except most don’t get tested and think they are negative. Like I thought i was. ### True but what’s really getting me is that I guess they tested it twice and the first one came out negative but the second one positive ### This might be a silly question, but where do you get the western bolt? Also, that test is only done by swabbing right? ### Chances are you may have been tested too soon or the false neg with hsv1. With no OB a solid positive means you have the virus but a negative doesn’t necessarily mean you don’t , due to the false neg rate . ### Western blot is this link

Uni of washington , Terri Warren . 

It’s a blood test that you get a lab to do locally and you ship it to the site above. 

Swabs ( pcr ones more accurate ) can only be done on an active OB. So no lesions or sore then it’s igg or western blot. ### ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/ta5ncq/hsv_results/
ta25zf,"Herpes, HIV, or What? I’ll try to make this long story short. I was with this one guy for 4 years we both would constantly get tested (herpes included) & we were negative for everything. I had this new partner in January. Before doing anything with him I asked him if he gets checked & I also asked for paperwork. He said yea & that he would show me. The day we had sex (i didn’t want to but he was pushing it so i kinda just let him). I asked for the paperwork he claims he left it at home. Made him get a condom & we literally only had sex for 2 minutes. He had came in me even though I told him I don’t let ppl ejaculate in me.. so to my luck, the condom had a hole in it so I noticed his fluid was everywhere. Panic ensued for me. I immediately got a plan B and began to worry. I later asked him that day if he really ever got checked he finally confirmed to me that he never did & that he would “know” if he had something (yk dumb stuff guys say sometimes) & I’m like you can be asymptomatic. So now I’m very angry that my sexual health is at risk when I tried to take precautions. 2 weeks after that sexual encounter I went to get checked at a local clinic where everything came back negative (including herpes) the only thing the nurse said I had was BV. A week after my BV treatment ended (3 weeks after the sexual encounter) I started experiencing bad symptoms. Genital sore/ulcers (itched & bled),I experienced a mouth sore that would come and go and went away in a day. I also experienced fatigue, swollen lymph nodes, malaise, loss of appetite, etc. I then went to a regular physician for the symptoms she tells me nothing is wrong and that I don’t have a fever and that I’m just over stressed and have anxiety so she referred me to a counselor. I then got fully checked at another GYN where all the test results came back negative again (including herpes & the  blood drawn HIV test 1 month after encounter). Now it’s basically 6 weeks after the encounter and the main symptom I still have now is the bleeding genital ulcers. These past few weeks I’ve been extremely depressed, my anxiety has been through the rough. It has impacted my whole life, school, work, family, friends. I’ve tried to talk to the recent partner about what I’ve been going through but he’s been extremely difficult and not wanting to get tested. It took me forever to get him to do a simple HIV test where they pricked his finger (he claims it came back negative) but I feel like I can no longer trust him since he lied from the beginning. I asked him to do a full STD screening and he literally refused. It’s crazy how 2 minutes of nothing, can cause 2 months of pain & distress for me. I constantly feel like I hate myself for ever encountering this person. I’ve been trying to accept it all but it sucks having to wait months to get fully accurate results. I just don’t know what’s wrong with me and want to get treated and feel better. I’m just looking for help or advice or someone to listen. I feel like I’ve been going through this all by myself with no one to talk to at all.",10,2022-03-09 02:07:06-05:00,"I'm so sorry this happened to you. 

First, stop relying on him for information. He's not ever going to be honest, and he's already violated you in so many ways. 

Did you actually see the condom? It sounds like he stealthed you - says he would wear a condom and then didn't. 

In any case, if you got a 4th Gen DUO HIV test at 28 days or later, that's conclusive. Check your test results. 

Get your ulcers swabbed, and have them type it, so you'll know if it's type one or type 2, if it is herpes. Do that now. Did you give him oral sex? If you did, and you still have oral sores, have them do the same for those. 

You can also get a type specific IgG blood test now - 70% of people test positive by 6 weeks. If your result is between a 1.10 and 3.5, it could be a false positive, though. Just keep that in mind. It's conclusive at 12 weeks (the false positive still applies).

Herpes sores don't typically bleed, but no STD presents with bleeding ulcers, so keep getting checked until you get an answer. 

Also, don't hesitate to get therapy if you think it will help. You didn't want this encounter, and now you have all this other stuff happening. 

Take good care of you. 💖 ### You said u had BV. in my experience, that's itchy as hell. could you have scratched yourself and it got infected? I remember bleeding when I had bv coz I kept scratching myself. ### Sweety, I’m so sorry. This is so similar to what happened to me. The hate I had for myself and the guy is and was so intense. 

I don’t even have encouraging words to say but I’m so sorry you have to deal with this, it really sucks but I really hope you get answers from someone….    Fuck that guy also. ### you should have never slept with him before getting to know him 🤦‍♂️ ### Lots of great info here! ### Thanks & yea I actually seen the condom. I just don’t get how it broke unless there was already a hold in it prior. I just literally feel so dumb for allowing this 2 minute encounter for happening. I feel like no one’s going to want me anymore. Especially my ex trying to get back with me who I love so dearly. He’s going to never want to talk to me again once I tell him what happened to me 😞& then if this does turn into something I’ve kinda been debating seeking legal action. Since I’ve really had to go out and seek all this mental and physical help & the person just really seems to not be helpful nor complain which makes me truly feel like they may know they have something they just refuse to get tested. ### The last time i went to the gyn which was 4 weeks after the encounter. She swabbed me for bv & yeast as well and said the BV is totally cleared and that i actually have really good bacteria ### i did get to know them, we were talking for 7 months.

t9o4ia,"My Written Disclosure!! Hey peoples!! I’ve been DMing this to people who ask for it, and I figured I should post it for more to access. I’ve been using this written disclosure since I started needing to disclose. I find it to be very successful!! Early on I recognized that I needed to come from a place assuming that people know jack about herpes. Because most don’t.

Instead of telling people I have herpes, then leaving it to them to understand what that means, I send the disclosure, which reveals my status and educates in one go. 

It’s really helpful for the person you’re telling to have space from you at the time. It takes the pressure off them, so they don’t have to feel like they’ve been put on the spot, which is something that probably won’t go very well. Space gives them the time to think about it, to process what the disclosure presents, and to do their own research, all without trying to figure out in the moment how to feel about it or react.

Something I’ve found that is super important when disclosing, is your attitude. If you present it like it’s a bad thing, or like it’s shameful, or if you clearly feel negatively about it, well, people are going to think it’s a bad and shameful thing, and they’ll be scared about it. Learning to be confident around it goes a long way.

Anyways, here it is!! Do whatever you want with it, PLEASE MAKE IT YOUR OWN!!!!

DISCLOSURE:

So, in the name of not wasting either of our time, I need to send you this….

I know it’s a lot to read, but bare with me, and please read it all when you are able. I don’t need an answer right away on whether you’re okay with this. Take your time deciding, no rush, but as I mention in my write up, there are still things we can do that won’t spread it. And please, any questions you have, totally ask. I am not easily offended, and as long as your questions come from a place of genuinely wanting to learn/know, and not a place of judgement, then I’m happy to talk about it all. I will not take a decision not to proceed, personally.

I have to divulge that I have hsv2(genital). I have had it for 3 years, and have been on antivirals for it since the beginning. In general, it is nothing but a skin condition. One that has been overblown and that has had a lot of fear mongering around it.

Now, for the info and stats on this. First, it is incredibly common, especially in women. The way our genitals are, make it easy for us to catch. About 1/6 adults in the US/Canada and Europe have it, and an estimated 13% to possibly 20% of the adult population, ages 15-49, have hsv2 genital worldwide. People with hsv1(cold sores/oral) make up about 67%(3.7 billion)of the population, ages 0-49 worldwide. Why this is important in relation to hsv2 genital, is that people with oral herpes can pass it on to genitals when giving oral sex. Both can give you genital herpes, and there is an estimated 140-190 million people 15-49, who have genital herpes from hsv1 oral. That’s on top of the percent of cases caused from hsv2 genital. 

Now, here’s the kicker. Only about 10-20%  of people with herpes experience symptoms. Everyone else(80-90% of people with herpes) are asymptomatic, or have symptoms so mild they don’t even notice them. These people still pass on the virus. They are still contagious. So the people who actually have symptoms, and are therefor diagnosed with it, get the stigma. We know we have it and therefor should tell partners that we have it. But, the majority of people that have it will never know, and never have to divulge this to a partner, but they still pass it on. Basically, with every partner you have, you are risking getting hsv1 or hsv2. The risk is unavoidable if you’re going to be sexually active. 

The reason the asymptomatic people don’t know they have it, is because unless you have symptoms, or are at high risk for it, doctors do not test for it. When you go in for a full STI test, herpes is not included. Because if you don’t have symptoms, why do a test that could put you in a stigmatized group? The attitude of the medical community is what you don’t know won’t hurt you. You don’t have symptoms, why worry you or hurt your sex life by giving you the info that you have asymptomatic herpes, when the majority of the adult population has a form of asymptomatic herpes. My own doctor told me it was unnecessary for me to disclose my status to people, because it is so enmeshed in the population. I had a friend in med school, and at the beginning of one semester, one of their teachers said to the class “we all have herpes, now get over it” lol.

Now, I’m on anti-virals for it and have been on them daily since my diagnosis. People are the most contagious in the first 12-18 months, and after that the risk of transmission drops. They are also the most contagious when they’re having an outbreak, which I haven’t had since my initial ones because of antivirals. Taking antivirals for it daily, decrease the chance of passing it on by 50-77%(there’s a different percentage decrease for passing it on to be a symptomatic or asymptomatic infection. 50% for asymptomatic, 77% reduction for passing on a symptomatic infection). Using condoms decreases the chance another %50. I’ve had this for 3 years. So my possible infectivity has dropped as well.

I’m not saying there’s no risk of getting it from me. But you honestly are chancing it with every partner you have, because it’s everywhere. And if you get it from someone, the chances are it will be asymptomatic, and you’ll never know you have it. You may also have a form of herpes already, and that isn’t a slight chance.

So I leave it with you to decide if this is something you’re okay with. If not we can still make out, touch eachother all over our bodies, fingering/toys on me, and oral on me. It’s “possible” to pass hsv2 to the mouth through oral sex, but it is very very very very very very rare, and is only really a risk for immuno compromised people, not the general population. The risk is so low that it’s negligible. Honestly, if you don’t already have oral herpes, if you get it, it will be from one of the 3.7 billion people who have oral herpes, not from me. And I can still suck your cock sloppy!!

I encourage you to go read up on it. Government public health websites and university sites are the best source for information on it. What I’ve written here should be quite accurate as I’ve read up on it a lot, but perhaps some numbers are off.

As of now, we have not come up with a way of stopping the spread of this. They may come up with a vaccine one day, but as of now, the majority of the adult population will have it and will pass it on. It’s just the way it goes. It’s just a part of being a sexually active adult.

PS “Basically, with every partner you have, you are risking getting hsv1 or hsv2.” And “You may have a form of herpes already.” 
I do not say these things to freak you out, just to help put things in perspective. You have probably already been with sexual partners that have had this(and they have been with sexual partners that had it, and so on and so forth), and you’ve definitely been with partners who have oral herpes, they just didn’t know they had it, but they were still contagious regardless.

I thought contagiousness dropped after 6-12 months?

And also what does the 50-77% stat with symptomatic/asymptomatic infections mean? ### Thanks you SO MUCH for this. I’m planning on talking to my partner soon and I’ve been kinda lost on how to disclose. This helps a lot; I read it from the perspective as if I didn’t have it and at the end of the day is not such a big deal as society has made it look like (?). As you said, it is a skin condition. I’m still worried about transmitting it to them, tho. I’m visiting my gyno in two days and I’ll be focusing on how to identify an OB in time. 

How has your overall experience with daily antivirals been like? Thanks again. ### So I don’t have references written down(I should sit down one day and collect them), but everything is from government public health sites(Canada, US(even individual state/province sites, UK), WHO, planned parenthood, PubMed, NCBI, and medical university sites. Key words to put in: Herpes Simplex, Statistics, Facts, Anti-Virals, Transmission Rates, Condoms.

*keep in mind that these statistics are for ages 15-49 for HSV2, and 0-49 for HSV1. ### Having trouble finding the info on the months for dropping contagiousness, but I’ll keep looking.

The 50-77% is in relation to taking antivirals. It’s how much of a decrease in transmission was found when taking antivirals long term. 50% decrease in the chance of passing on an asymptomatic infection, 77% decrease in the chance of passing on a symptomatic infection. ### So, when using condoms, the chance of transmission to men is actually super low. It’s about 0.7 transmissions per 1000 sex acts. I’ve been meaning to update the disclosure and add in transmission rates per gender with and without condoms.

I’ve personally had no issues with taking antivirals, as in no side effects, and I never get out breaks. It’s been years since I’ve had one. ### ",18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/t9o4ia/my_written_disclosure/

In fact one of the first doctors I talked to about it during my OB thought it was just from not enough lubrication. The more fissure like ones usually don’t “scab” per se. More so turn white as they heal. And they sting more than itch for me. I think that’s what makes herpes so tricky. It appears differently enough on people that it can sometimes be hard to tell what’s what just from visuals. If you’re concerned and are able to, I’d go to an urgent care or something to get it swabbed to confirm what it might be. ### lichen sclerosus often causes these fissures as well. Would be worth talking with your Dr about that possibility ### Something else I’ve found that many women have is cuts from yeast infections and bacterial infections. I once got examined and that’s what my Obgyn said they were I even explained all the symptoms I had. I was curious do any symptoms come prior to the cuts appearing like tingling, etc?

I WAS getting fissures/microtears after sex or even after trying to use tampons towards the end of my period. Few questions:

- have you ever tested positive for herpes for hpv?
- are you on hormonal birth control?
- does sex hurt even if you use lubrication?

I had an appointment when I had an active fissure and she said ""wow that looks like herpes!"" Swabbed, blood test, every test! All negative. 

My issue with fissures was also associated with painful sex in general. This was linked to vulvodynia. ### I had some tears come up that were suspected to be herpes or lichen this was around July and I’m still going through it 😩 I’m completely exhausted ### I only get fissures during my outbreak. Swabbed positive on them. Hope this helps... ### Thank you for your response! I actually did get it swabbed and those were negative but it kept coming back and the blood test I got was a 1.17 twice. Do you remember where your fissure like outbreaks were? How long? healing time? etc.. sorry for all the questions. ### Oh interesting, have you had those before? or it before? Thank you! ### When you say yours were, do you mean the ones related to yeast? 

And to be quite honest, maybe I am just missing something, I did not get any tingling or weird feelings before. I did have a severe itch for a few months, like an everyday thing with or without a tear, but was swabbed for yeast and nothing came up. ### Thank you for your response as that is exactly what I am dealing with!

To answer, I too have been it and had it swabbed about 5 times and all have been negative. However, a blood test put me in the false positive range, so now I am not sure which to believe. 

I was on hormonal birth control, low dose, for awhile and actually changed it last year which helped and then officially went off of it about three months ago. 

I definitely experience pain during sex even with lubrication and honestly convinced myself that was normal. ### It is the worst trying to figure out! What have you done to be tested? ### That helps a lot thank you! What are your fissures like? How long does it take to heal? ### I’ve noticed a skin tear in the fold of my ground. It felt like it was after a long hike. And I cannot at all remember if I may have scratched my self.  

I suspect i have ghsv1. But I can’t tell if this Is from that or not ### My fissure-like OBs come on very suddenly. It’s like I go to bed with everything fine and then the next morning when I wake up and I instantly know I’m having an OB. And so far they show up in the same place every time, which is on the area right below the vaginal opening. I’m on 500mg valacyclovir daily and take 2g daily during an OB. So maybe like a week before I feel like everything is fully healed? There’s like 3ish days of it being fairly uncomfortable. Without meds it’s like 2-2.5 weeks to fully heal. ### I have! It was more prevalent when I was younger and just kind of started going away and I forgot all about it for years . I had a few recurring fissures about 6 months after having my youngest in 2020. Usually it is treated with topical steroids. ### Sorry yes I meant the cuts I had, according to my Obgyn, were cuts caused by yeast infections and bacterial infections and interestingly when I opened up to several friends every single one said they had the same thing so I guess it’s rather common. I described my symptoms as cuts that would burn and they wouldn’t be there for long. No scabbing, no tingle, no herpes like symptoms outside of being cuts and burning. Are you prone to bacterial infections? ### I would give it some time again and then test again. From what I've seen, first herpes outbreak is usuly associated with a myriad of other uncomfortable symptoms.

I was on a low-dose hormonal BC for a long time too. You may have a sensitivity to fake estrogen (which I did as well) which causes symptoms extremely similar to menopause (painful sex, dry, painful even with lube). It causes the vaginal walls and lining to thin out and your perinial region to become tight and lose natural elasticity. Not only is this uncomfortable, but causes lots of tearing and microtears which feel like little tiny papercuts.

Stopping BC is great at will deff take your body time to regulate after. The biggest things that helped me aside from going off hormones: applying 100% organic vitamin E oil to the entire taint region and perinial (idk if I'm spelling that right lol) 2x a day. This helps bring back natural elasticity. Also purchased emuaid cream. It's pricy but a little goes a long way. 1 jar lasted me a LONGGGG time. This can be applied safely to fissures down there and help heal the area. I did this all the way until I just didn't have issues anymore. It also took me a while with having sex to be adjusted and not anticipate pain.

I would deff look into vulvodynia. It may not be exactly what you have but healing techniques could be helpful. Hormonal BC pill is the biggest culprite.

I switched to the hormonal IUD (doesn't contain fake estrogen and is localized) and the issue did not reoccur. ### I had a swab when the first lesion popped up and it came back negative. At around that same time my skin was turning white I didn’t notice because I never look at my anus and apparently the doctor didn’t notice either. It started to spread in patched to my vagina. I had blood test for Hsv at 6-10-12 weeks all negative for hsv2 but hsv1 is positive because I got my first cold sore two years ago but I’m conflicted on whether or not I have hsv1 orally and genitally or it’s just lichen. I had tearing again a while ago it’s just frustrating because someone just mentioned they get tearing outbreaks that turn their skin white and that’s what happens to me ### Also I wanted to mention I never noticed before but I have those same identical cut like things inside of my labia like you. I think it’s normal we just never notice until something crazy happens and we over check ourselves. ### Really like red ""string like"" wounds on my perineum (little part from vagina to anus) and most of the times on the inside of ""major labia"" (so between big end small lips, that skin) mostly takes 3 days but I am in antivirals.. when I wasnt on them it took approx. 10 days. ### Very interesting and pretty relatable on how sudden they come on. However, my disappear within about 24 hours. When you say the area right below, do you mean like the thin part of skin between the vagina and anus? ### Wow, and did you find them often happening in the same place? Were they painful? ### I am not entirely sure as I have never asked. I could see my Ph levels being off at times though or having some discomfort every now and then down there! ### I totally feel you! It is an incredibly confusing time because both things act so differently on each individual it is hard to know which one actually is causing what or if either are doing anything. Please keep me updated on your search for an answer and I will do the same! ### How long would you say they are? and the ones by your perineum, are there a lot? ### Mhmm I think it’s called the perineum. ### Yes. Always in the same two spots. They sting like a paper cut ### Mostly 2 at the perineum (not much space there lol) and 1 long cut on inside of major labia  (I would say 3cm if you want me to be exact hahaha) ### Oh yes, okay- mine are occurring more on the inside- I have a photo available on my profile, are yours that small/ surface?? ### Wow, that is very similar to what I experienced. Does it heal quickly? ### How did you find out about this? I constantly have this one spot that feels like a tear on the opening of my vagina ### Lol yes- so sorry for the many questions- thank you!! 

And, so sorry for one more, do they all show at the same time? ### I’d say that they are “surface” like the image but much larger (1/2” or so in length, 1/8” wide) and way more red and angry looking before they’ve had a few days to heal. Your photo doesn’t appear to be noticeable inflamed, red and irritated like mine get. ### No worries hahaha that's why we are here! Uhmm it depends I only get the one on my major labia when it is ""very progressed"" and extreme. The perineal cuts I get every time after sex and therefore during an outbreak. It is a real trigger for me. Just like shaving and other irritations.. ### Interesting! Thank you so much!! I really appreciate your help :) I am not sure what to do from here! ### And are you certain the cuts on your perineum are an outbreak? That seems to then be very frequent? Are they there before you have sex or directly after? ### 100% certain. Swabbed twice. 1-2 days after sex ### Wow I am so sorry! And those hang around for 3 days? ### ",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/t9wbkh/have_you_ever_had_a_fissure_as_an_outbreak/

No, that would be highly unusual.

>Haven’t been painful or burst.

Are you saying that some of the same bumps/lesions have been present for the whole past 2 months? If that's the case then it definitely isn't herpes. Herpes lesions last 2-10 days and they go through their entire series of phases within that time (blister formation, blister, blister surface erosion leaving an ulcer, crusting/scabbing, and scab healing), so they don't remain looking unchanged for more than a day or two either.

A first time outbreak can last longer than 10 days becomes sometimes additional lesions can occur as the original batch is starting to heal. But individual lesions would last 2-10 days only. ### did you get tested and take anti viral medication? ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/ta3aw0/herpes_initial_outbreak_for_2_months/

Recently things have been very rocky for us and I feel like we are on the verge of a breakup (haven’t talked in a whole day which is rlly not like us)  :/ I feel very scared and nervous bc I truly feel like he is the only person who will ever accept me with this virus. I don’t plan on getting into the dating scene anytime soon, def gonna give it a couple years but I’m terrified to do so and one day have to disclose. (Non-disclosure will NEVER be an option for me, period.) So I guess my question to you guys is do people with herpes ever find true love?? I’m scared I’m never gonna be able to have a relationship/be in love ever again and having a family one day with my own beautiful babies is something I’ve always wanted so badly but I feel like that has been robbed from me. If any of you with hsv have had successful dating stories pls share bc I’m very down rn and I’d love to hear stories that make me feel better and reassure me that maybe I do still have a chance at love and building my own family one day. Ugh life is hard I want to cry… & to make things worse he was the only person I was ever able to cry to bc he was the only person who knew about my diagnosis.

Please reach out if you need anything!! I promise it gets bettertr ### Hi there things will be ok! I’m a little older but came from a similar situation where I thought I was going to be with the person who gave it to me forever then it all came crashing down. I ended up dating someone else who was positive, I think that helped me realize that life can still be normal with this virus. Currently just had my first disclosure to a non-positive person and it went really well! Just allow yourself to feel down when you need to while remembering that you are still an awesome person who deserves romance & love. I feel like if someone really wants you they won’t care about this virus. ### So sorry to hear your going through it. I’ve been going through what you are for some time now, still am. Everyone heals and moves on differently. It’s important to remain in the present moment in my opinion. Anxiety festers from thoughts of the past and future. If you can learn to live in the present and tell yourself that your worthy I believe things do get better (I have not found that moment yet for me personally, but I still strive to attain it). Your young and have alot of time left. Talk to a therapist if you need do what you need to do for yourself. Console him as well. He may have given it to you, but may feel guilty or hurt that he’s done so. Don’t forget about him because his feelings matter too.

t9v2lg,"Just how contagious is HSV1? Hello everyone! Im new here and I’m looking for some insight. I hooked up with a girl last night and she preformed oral sex for about 20 seconds before we had sex (no condom). I wore a condom during sex but it had broken without me noticing until I had already finished. We bought plan B, but on the way to the store the girl looked at her lip and panicked. I looked over to see the very early stage of HSV1 on her upper lip. 

Now here are my questions….

1.) What is the chance that her HSV1 had been transmitted in that short period of oral sex? 

2.) How contagious is HSV1 in its very early stage? I’m talking before the blisters had popped

3.)  When should I go get tested? How long does it take for herpes to show on a test?

Any information is greatly appreciated. I’m a young male with little to no knowledge on this sort of thing so please help !",5,2022-03-08 19:26:04-05:00,"Pretty high chance my man…especially if she has a sore active when giving oral. I got hsv-1 orally & genitally on the same instance from kissing & oral before vaginal sex. Unless you already have hsv-1 orally (you would be more immune to it genitally) you may have been infected. Just stay on top of it & check within the next couple weeks. ### Yea it’s pretty contagious have you had any questionable bumps? I’ve heard about 12 days for the body to make antibodies for testing. So I’d wait two weeks? And maybe get retested in a month. Have you ever been tested for it before because a lot of people already have it but in dormancy aka asymptomatic. ### No bumps or itching but it’s only been two days since we hooked up. I’m only 19 and have never been tested before but I plan on getting tested in two weeks just like you said with a retest after 90 days ### It’s quite possible you could have had it already not to minimize that you could also get it from this partner. A lot of people are children when they get it through kissing, sharing drinks, even some times birth if mom has it. Especially oral herpes since the other tends to be more from sexual things. The thing is a lot of times it’s lying dormant meaning asymptomatic in a majority of people with it. So it doesn’t have an age limit. My younger brother has it and I’ve never seen him share anything with my mom while she has active cold sores but he some how did get it may not have even been her. It’s sadly just that contagious. But something I’d suggest spending time doing so you don’t get yourself in a spiraling sadness like many have is doing some educational research. A lot of it is stigma and lack of knowledge. It’s only an STD because yes it’s possible to spread via sex but that’s because it’s contagious via skin to skin so that means any skin to skin so it is not exclusively an std. ### ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/t9v2lg/just_how_contagious_is_hsv1/

t9rzfz,"I pray in times like this. Hello r/Herpes,
 
Today I write in to share a piece of myself to a community I did not choose willingly to belong too. Forgive me if that sounds insensitive. I am coming from a place of anguish and do not mean to be hurtful or judgmental to any person reading this. For 3-4 years now I have been living with the knowledge of my diagnosis for HSV-1. I am 29 M years old. I cannot tell you for certain how I got it because my intimate life has pretty much never existed. My sexual history includes a girl that I hooked up with in highschool, and a girl I had sex with randomly (out of pity really) many years ago. My first sign of confirmation was the cold sore on my lip more than 10 years after those two instances. I had gotten tested at a planned parenthood not sure what kind of test and I was positive for HSV1 and not HSV2. I have had two coldsores in my life ever on my lip the first one 3-4 years ago and the second one this past December when I had covid-19. I assume it exposed itself again because I was in the middle of fighting covid when my immune system was under distress. Makes sense. My family members have had them they don’t know anything about HSV. They looked at me like I had 5 heads when I told my folks they have herpes, and that it was probable that they spread it to me at some younger age maybe due to my painfully limited sex life. Maybe thats a cope. One thing I can say for sure is Im afraid, hurt, disappointed and confused. All my life I’ve never had great fortune in areas that mattered. I lived an irresponsible life of gaming addiction for over 15 years that limited and or prevented me from having experiences in life; Experiences in work, love, adventure, risk, and other characteristics that flourish in our adolescence. I am at a point in my life were I got my act together, found a great salary big boy job with benefits, im living a healthier life with diet and exercise, my folks are happy with me,and I really want to find someone to share something with. But I haven’t been happy in a long time. Its hard to recall the time I was happy, for real happy. Amongst being shitty at male to female relations, I am mostly still devastated by the fact this HSV-1 exists inside me. I thought it was difficult enough to be attracting. With the HSV on top of my inexperience I can’t help but to think it might be over before it’s even begun (Granted my specific circumstances and history). I have read alot.. About HSV, The lives people live with it, the tips and tricks to overcoming disclosure, and much more believe me it was un healthy how much I obsessed over it. Unfortunately I have not found any comfort or growth in any of this. I still hurt immensely and am harboring true feelings of disconnection. Depression is a word I don’t like to use because I don’t feel like its enough. My chest hurts deeply and tears come easy when I stare down the tunnel of reality and am reminded that nothing is changing and it’s for life. I use to be the type to have thick skin and high mental fortitude. This has for some time diminished, and I really don’t know how much more I can endure. That is always who I have been; one who endures. I use to find strength in that.. Now I’m honestly just disappointed in myself. I no longer feel normal and feel alone. I’ve never felt alone like this. I am so sorry for anyone else who feels this way in life. If I could change it for you I would! in seconds.. Love is something I’de like to try once before leaving the planet. Any efforts made will be in pursuit of such privileges. I’m sorry if I sound pathetic, or if i’m just the next and not the last newbie in here looking for something I won’t find. I feel like talking is healthy which is why I chose to do so. If anyone is reading who does not have HSV; I can only offer you testimony of regrets. Be the best you, practice and research safe sex, and never limit yourself. We live one live go out there and live it while you can. BE GOOD TO EACH OTHER! and tell that girl or boy you like her… NEVER suppress your feeling out of fear! Anxiety festers from the past and the future if you live in the present and focus on whats before you the anxiety will cease like a dog being told to stop barking (in most cases lol). Thats all its been a long rant I wont bore you any longer. Open to dialogue or comments of any kind. Thanks for reading! Have a great day, Love.",4,2022-03-08 16:57:17-05:00,"First, I want to start with your writing is just beautiful and if this is anywhere close to how you talk, you could probably change lives. Have you ever thought of becoming an HSV advocate? Of course that would mean overcoming the devastation and accepting the virus. But the way you write is something special.

Second, the same advice you added at the end of your passage, you need to start telling yourself. I’m sure you’re an overall good guy. It’s easier said than done, I know, but start practicing by telling yourself every day you’re worthy and deserving. 

Fortunately for you, you have the virus that the majority of the population has and it’s very much accepted in society. Given you’ve done all your research, I’m sure you can figure out a prompt way to disclose. 

We all struggle in some way. I’ve had ghsv1 for a couple months now and it has been nothing but a struggle. I’m trying to get back into the swing of loving myself and it’s a slow process. 

Do yourself a favor and start taking the risks that you missed out on in your earlier life. Don’t let the diagnosis hinder you from living your life. 29 is just beginning in many ways. 

I wish you the best. ### Dude, you have a virus that at least 70% of the world's population carries and that most of society does not view negatively or care about. Unless you are having actual physical symptoms that interfere with your quality of life then it's basically a non-issue. Move on with your life. ### I’ve never been good at taking my own advise. I appreciate your comments and thoughts it
means a lot. For you only having hsv for a couple months I could only recall where I was at month two. For me that early it was a breeding ground of hatred and malice. I would not recommend going down this path if you feel yourself falling into this please retract. It’s not worth it and its physically and mentally exhausting trust me. I wish you all the people in this community who struggle all the happiness in the world. ### I will try my best for the people who have resolved themselves and have found a way out.

t9xzle,"First GHSV1 outbreak i know that everyone's outbreak is different, but its been so long since i got a oshv1 outbreak.. i cant remember the sequence.

For those with GHSV1, do you get a fever before or after the outbreak? What symptoms do you have?

I infected my bf (pending results.. but its so likely..) i didnt have any sores. last outbreak for me was 4 years ago. but i did get a booster jab for covid a day prior to infecting him (i think), so immunity might be down and i might be shedding. i dont know.

He started having red bumps and then sores (looked like little cuts that keep appearing) immediately. no crusting, no blisters, no pain, no fever, no aches. nothing. His sores are not clustered. they are spread all over his dick. it looks alot like the female version of OHSV1.

we went to see the doc, who visually confirmed hsv1. was sent for a battery of tests where we are now pending results. Doc gave him  *Valaciclovir.* He developed a fever, muscle ache, chills, was feeling weak. Ive stopped him from taking more meds until i get confirmation from the doc to continue.

So my question is, those who were recently infected, do your fever comes before or after the outbreak? 

After your inital outbreak, did you take medication? If you didnt, did it come back quickly? 

BTW, his sores have completely disappeared, 3-4 days after it appeared. But i know that psychologically, he's under alot of stress coz germaphobe. this is his worst nightmare. 

edit: I feel extremely guilty and very shitty about infecting him to the point of me wanting to leave him when I see him having fever. Bf is still in denial. but I think he will be upset when we get the results. I'm already mentally preparing for a break up.

Also know that, she's aware she has it and will be more aware of symptoms etc to avoid contact and so you're safer rather than with someone new who may not even know they have it. That's the tricky thing with herpes, you may leave someone you like right now and then end up getting it right after anyway 

Either way, please don't say ""you play with fire you get burnt by fire"" on the herpes subreddit that's filled with people who have it. It's very demeaning. ### If you’ve ever had a cold sore you probably already have it. More than 60 % of the U.S does. Anyways the chances are very low if she has no visible sores. ### 😂😂😂😂 67% of America has ohsv1. You’ll come in contact with it eventually ### Wow just leave her alone if ur going have that mindset. ### Apparently if you have hsv2 it’s harder to get hsv1. Not impossible but yeah. ### You should get a test to see if you already have it!! ### So I’m pretty sure I can shed some light on this I am diagnosed with HSV 1 and HSV 2 before the relationship I had HSV 1 we were together for 2+ years she never contracted HSV 1 also I got HSV 2 from her. ### You might catch it from any girl especially from tongue if she does blowjob on you without protection you might get it or not ### you’re deeping it bro. It’s a literally a cold sore. 70-80% of the world population has the virus in their body. If you end things with her you’re just going to end up with someone else who has it. ### [deleted] ### Sorry I dont mean it like that my bad, these past few days I been researching and yess it’s a skin condition but I’m factoring in of this does not work out and I get it, I could ruin other opportunities and people not wanting me, totally doffrent if she lived here and were were getting married, it’s hard enough with her in another country, sorry I definitely don’t look down on people with that most of the time it’s not there fault so really sorry ### It’s high but certainly not 97%. Otherwise the prevalence of ghsv1 would be very low in the US, but it’s not ### Do you have herpes ? And your opinion just to date would you date someone with Ohvs1
Knowing you could get genital hvs 1 ### I did I don’t have it ### It’s a friend from another country and we are meeting for the first time and we both got tested before it was her idea and she has that ### So it’s really just a gamble ### You had oral or genital hsv1 ### Do you have herpes ? ### Lol not being a dick but pay up brother I don’t lol ### I have proof ### Oh I think I got the percentage wrong my bad 💀 but yes it’s very high ### Yes but I have genital herpes. 

Let’s say I had no herpes at all and someone told me they had oral herpes,  I would still date them.  Because almost everyone does and some don’t even know. 

Also ask her how often she has an outbreak. If it’s not often then you don’t need to worry.

Herpes lesions *usually* have more irregularly shaped edges and surfaces, often appearing as if multiple smaller blisters/lesions partially joined together into a larger one, and they usually experience some degree of sensation as well -- at least when touched or rubbed directly.

So I broke things off with her, at first she just left me alone, than she started calling insistently from various numbers. Then she started randomly coming to my apartment and parking in front of the building etc. So I decided to live at my cousins basement. I told him some bs story.

Of course we don’t want people to commit suicide but you’re not her certified psychiatrist nor therapist so I hope you don’t try putting that responsibility on your shoulder though I do understand the worry. If she has been texting you evidence about all of this then it’s all the proof you would need to not be blamed for it. And if you really had to I would tell her that as far as you have evidence so she can’t lie about it. I would also say her telling you she wants to commit suicide or even blaming you for herpes is mostly going to continue if she knows she can get a reaction from you about it so if it’s possible I would just ignore and block her.

How long was your relationship if you don’t mind me asking? If it was a decent relationship by any capacity she definitely cares about you, and is probably concerned that you are hurt and wants to come to console you. You knew the risks before the relationship and accepted them somewhere down the line(according to your post) and thats the reality. I can full heartedly understand your pain. I was given this without wanting as well. I can’t ignore the fact though that somewhere down the line you thought this girl was worth enough to take the risk. She knew that as well and is why shes probably going extra right now. You need to go talk to that girl. Go and hug each other real tight bro no cap. She feels insanely guilty and is hurt for sure. I will tell you man to man though that it is slightly unfair to discard her because of something you knew could happen. She prob felt so validated when you decided to give her a chance and thats probably gone now again for her. Go give that girl a hug bruh.. just do it.

I just don't like the fact she keeps trying to meet, see me in person. It's so odd, the entire series of event these last 3 months feel soo odd.

I have no plans on doing that. For now I'm  gonna try convincing her to leave me alone. ### Bro I had no idea she had herpes, I knew she was  wild. My cousin who  knew her told me to keep my distance and I didn't listen. She went through some traumatic life experiences which made me feel attached to her because I also had some traumatic experience, not exactly the same experiences, but I could relate. She's done some shity stuff in the past, she kinda cheated on me once I forgave her because we were not speaking, we had a huge fight and we were not speaking for a week, I broke things off. We didn't speak for months and she had almost a mental breakdown when a close family member died. Thats what brought us back together. It's has  been a roller-coaster for a few years, but recently we had actually made huge progress, and we were good for a long time. I wanted to marry her It's all ruined now. I just want to move on, I don't think this is the person God intended for me. How can I be with someone I have zero trust in? What other disease do I need to catch before I get the hint. Its just too much. ### She's manipulating him and threatening him. She has no right to do that and he deserves far better. Why are you telling him to stay with her? It's not his job to stay with her. She needs a therapist not an emotional hostage boyfriend. I'm a woman and I say run. ### No convincing crazy with nothing to lose. ### In my personal opinion, and maybe I’m wrong but, she’s saying everything she can to keep you still paying attention to her. The more energy you put into trying to convince her the more she’ll keep at it because to her it’s probably a success she can still get you responding and reacting to her. ### Yup. Sounds like my ex. He started messaging everyone I know including my parents about me. I have never encountered another person who didn’t care how bad their actions made them look as long as he made me look bad. Once I blocked him, I found out he had taken my debit card info & paid his phone bill with it. I reported it as a fraudulent charge & got my money back & his phone cut off. 

She will move on to another person she can manipulate & continue her life cycle as a user. Just like a mosquito. 

Be the better person. Don’t engage. Contact will become less & less frequent until she finds someone else. Then you’re freeeeee


Also, she will never commit suicide. She is just manipulating you ### So you never got herpes from her or you have it too ### This is unhealthy for you. You deserve far better than this. Don't allow her to keep you hostage. You will look back and regret it if you do. ### I think that often people are misunderstood. Clearly shes in a bad place mentally. Untill his comment with additional information about the cheating and not knowing she had it which I missed before I guess my opinion sways but is probably still firm. My point was just to be supportive in sight of pain for both parties. If she has been destructive yes you should probably separate. His faith seems intact. I have faith hell push through all my chips are with him here. ### Exactly. I agree with this. I think not disclosing can be hurtful and some who love/care about each other enough can work through it as we are human who make human decisions however where it crosses the point of no return is when there’s threats involved, threatening to kill themself, constant and consistent harassment, and blackmail them. That’s just too much and just further plummets down the dark rabbit hole of no return and the trust at that point shattered into a million pieces. ### I got herpes from her..she says she had it before we started dating...I don't believe her. ### Did you take any precautions and still got it or you just said fuck it lol ### We've been together for so long after a while...I know it was a bone head move. ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/t9qw9m/my_ex_is_harassing_blackmailing_me/
t9qjeh,I tested positives for ghsv1 but boyfriend tested negative He is the first person I've slept with. A couple weeks ago I started to get sores and went to the doctor. He said it looked like herpes and the swab test also came back positive. My boyfriends blood and urine test both came back negative. That doesn't make any sense to me since I've never done anything with anyone or showed symptoms. Are false negatives  common for asymptomatic people?,3,2022-03-08 15:49:42-05:00,">Are false negatives common for asymptomatic people?

False negatives are common for hsv1, but it has nothing to do with whether the person is asymptomatic. Standard IgG blood tests are not very good at detecting hsv1 -- they miss a full 30% of hsv1 infections.

Genital hsv1 is almost always the result of receiving oral sex from a partner who has oral hsv1. Did your boyfriend perform oral sex on you within 10 days prior to your symptoms starting? Genital hsv1 usually causes fairly extensive symptoms within 2-10 days of becoming infected. If your boyfriend is the only person who has performed oral sex on you then he is all but certainly the source of your infection. ### Yes he is the only one to perform oral sex on me and did 3 days before my first outbreak. That's why I was so confused with his results. He's getting tested again in 1-2 weeks which his doctor suggested. ### Yes, he is very likely the source of your infection. The most likely scenario here is that your boyfriend has it orally but his test simply missed it. 

Note that, for people for whom the IgG test misses an infection, it will tend to do so repeatedly (ie on repeat testing as well).

There is another blood test, the Western Blot, that accurately detects 95% of hsv1 infections -- a much better rate than the standard IgG (and the best rate there is for a blood test), but it is not a standard test and must be specially ordered. It is discussed on our wiki page on herpes testing: [LINK](https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/wiki/herpes_testing). You guys may wish to consider that (for your boyfriend) if he continues to test negative on the IgG. ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/t9qjeh/i_tested_positives_for_ghsv1_but_boyfriend_tested/
t9q4z5,"NSFW: Need advice on if this looks / sounds like herpes from people who have had mild herpes outbreaks hi everyone! 

i am sorry because I am sure the constant “is this herpes” posts / questions can get old. But I really am at a loss on this. Because to me, it looks like it would be herpes and would make sense because I had unprotected sex 7 days before these popped up but my doctor and the tests have said otherwise (now 4 months past potential exposure and still negative). Which might also make sense based off of some coincidences at the time. 

Okay so backstory:
i am 25F, and had unprotected sex with a new partner (which is a whole other thing because I was drunk and told him no but thats not why I am here right now). anyway, I immediately started stressing over potential STIs. I am not someone who has multiple partners or is very sexual, just a personal thing but not judging anyone who is. So this is where my doctor thinks it isn’t herpes and just a coincidence- on about day 6 since the encounter, I went to the gym in new leggings that I didn’t wash before hand. I did get very sweaty and I made the mistake of running some errands in the same clothes before going home to shower. So she thinks it was just irritation / contact dermatitis, that evening, after showering, I was doing my check that I had been doing everyday since the encounter just incase something popped up and I could get to the doctor right away and I noticed an ingrown hair and plucked at it which caused a rip in my skin but nothing else was down there. The next morning, everything was fine minus the same redness that was there the day before when I noticed the ingrown hair which was there the day before and I just figured it was from the poor choice I made the day before from not changing and I went on about my day. That evening however, I noticed a line of blisters and a lot of dry skin on my right vulva but closer to the crease of my thigh where there was extra sewing with the leggings. I immediately started freaking out but it was 10pm and decided I would wake up and go to urgent care to get it swabbed… but when I wake up - the blisters were gone and already scabbed. No ulcer stage, no pain or itching, didn’t even last 14 hours. but I don’t know if it’s my anxiety over the matter and how things happened, but three of the blisters were clustered together. They didn’t touch and all three were their own, perfectly round, blisters - but they were RIGHT next to each other. Which from my research and reading all of your stories (everyone in here is very strong btw and I support you) , seems to be very common with herpes! I should add - I didn’t have any “flu like symptoms” either

I still went to the doctor and they swabbed it - but we both assumed it would come back negative since there was no liquid and we were right. I waited until 4 months and got blood tested, negative still. I haven’t had any other symptoms or “outbreaks” since then. 

I guess my question is - has anyone who has a confirmed case but is super mild had a similar experience? Where the blisters pop up and go away without going through all of the stages in under 24 hours! Also without hurting at all. Could this have been just pure coincidence? i know all of my tests are negative, but the blisters look too close to herpes to ignore.

I had the same thing and got it swabbed the day after they appeared and it came back positive for ghsv1. But the fact they go away so soon and don’t hurt is a bit confusing. Mine hurt so bad and stayed for a bit. I hope you get answers soon 🤞🏼 ### I haven’t had a confirmed case of anything genitally but I can say I have had something that looking like that a few times actually from ingrown hairs. Also sometimes if you’re someone with sensitive skin it could also very well be pimples which I’ve gotten a lot without the puss that look just like that. I think if you got tested multiple times over a course of time as well you’re probably safe. Herpes test ig are the least reliable of all of them however if you are testing an active bump and it’s negative I feel like that’s a sure thing. ### Looks like molluscum have you been tested ? ### thanks for replying! when you say same thing - do you mean the blisters looked similar? but they did stay longer than pretty much just overnight? i don’t want to doubt my doctor at all obviously, but I have learned that a lot of doctors do just write off herpes so that’s why I am a little concerned because it does look like it to me. ### Yes they looked the same, but they lasted a few days!

t9cbjh,"Has anyone caught it from their partner using condoms and aciclovir? Hi guys,
Just want some advice here from anyone with a long term partner where one of you is +ve and the other is -ve. My partner (female, I'm male) has HSV2 and so far from over a year of unprotected sex I've not got it taking no precautions.

We recently found out my partner has HSV2 and I just want to know if anyone in the same position has ended up getting it taking full precautions, no sex during outbreak, condoms and aciclovir for suppression?

Thanks!",12,2022-03-08 03:30:56-05:00,"I just contracted HSV2 from my new SO. I've used a condom everytime and got it only after 3 months. They weren't on any antivirals. ### I'm positive, my boyfriend is negative. I'm not on aciclovir, and only take suppressive medicine when I have an outbreak. We've been together for a year and change now, and so far he hasn't gotten it. We generally have unprotected sex and try to avoid sexual contact when I have an outbreak. I've had it for about 5 years now and just try to manage it with dietary changes. At times we'll use condoms, but for the most part it's something about me and us that he has had to come to terms with. 

The transmission rate from a woman to a man is about 1% if you take all the necessary precautions - condoms, daily suppressive medicine, and avoiding sexual contact when you feel an outbreak coming on. I've also read that transmission is more likely to happen within the first year of being together. Check out the herpes handbook, you'll find all the info there. I hope this helps. ### Just commenting to stay here. I'm dating a girl with Genetial herpes (HSV2). ### I’ve had two boyfriends that i was sexually actively with for 2 years.

t9ouia,Is there a reason why some people experience outbreaks and others don’t? I don’t get how I literally have an outbreak every month (right before my cycle comes on) and my distributor has no symptoms. How is that possible?,3,2022-03-08 14:32:49-05:00,"It seems like it’s almost random until you start looking at the science everyone’s body is built a little bit different so triggers look different for every single person. Some people are triggered by food other stress. Another thing taken to consideration is time your body naturally builds up antibodies overtime which helps your body fight off herpes making have less outbreaks as well as less of year. Some people recommend that you do a food diary to see if certain foods trigger your out break. For me it was definitely stress and my period going on an IUD help regulate my hormones making me have less outbreaks. I’m going to attach an outbreak guide which has a bunch of different home remedies that work for people to lower their outbreak rates but remember every body is different and what works for some people may not work for you so if there is some trial and error. You can also speak to a doctor if you are able to and they can also help pinpoint what is your trigger.

Yes there are things that can trigger outbreaks which are different for everyone but for girls it could be their natural hormones like before period for a lot of girls sadly. Me included. I've gone on antivirals because of it so maybe try that? I haven't yet had an outbreak since being on them. If you're in UK don't go to gp but go to sexual health clinic coz they'll give you some for free instead of prescription price.

Good to know abt other stuff tho. ### Honestly something seems off.  I don’t think you’ll find a single study on herpes anywhere that says it disappears practically overnight with any treatment. 

So it actually made me wonder if it wasn’t herpes. I had taken 2000 mg of Valtrex for three days and literally nothing was happening. 

When I do that with a cold sore, I can see progressive improvement once i start with even 500mg.  

So after 3-4 days on 2,000mg I said screw it and put peroxide, alcohol and abreva on the genital ones.  Overnight - instant 50% reduction in overall size.  Next morning 80% gone.  

Granted it lagged a bit from there for a couple days but the real knock out punch seemed to be the first 24-48 hours.   

I had remembered a friend 20 years ago with genital herpes telling me she always put peroxide on hers and it was gone the next day. Yet you’ll never hear anyone on any of these forums say this is true. And like I said, never in any studies either. ### That’s interesting.

t9mqse,"HSV IgG test really is so unreliable So I got my routine blood work done and results came back on the labcorp site. Recently I like to look through them before follow up with doctor so I’m prepared with what to ask about. I’m going down, everything looks normal. All STDs negative. Seems good. I get to HSV 1 and 2. I already knew I was positive for HSV 1, have been for years. As expected my IgG for that was +20.  But then I saw what was under that. 

HSV 2 IgG 1.39 positive
Supplemental test positive

Now this took be aback. Seemed so unlikely though I DID have a single questionable encounter a couple months back. Deep breath. Now I know herpes is no big deal in the grand scheme of things. But it still jarred me a bit. Suddenly thoughts of how this is a permanent part of life now raced through my head. Started kicking myself for that ONE encounter that did it. One simple action would lead to a lifetime of being positive. 

Researched online. Heard that HSV 2 IgG tests are incredibly unreliable with such a low IgG count. But my supplemental test had to confirm it, right? 

Just out of curiosity I figured I’d check my prior results from over the years and look at how my numbers used to be. I’ve been testing regularly every 3 months so I had lots to look back on. 

3 months ago. November 2021. Tested negative for HSV 2 with count being < .90. Sounds about right. 

3 months prior. August 2021. For some reason was not tested for HSV this time. No biggie. I know it’s not always a recommended test. 

3 more months prior. May 2021. Tested negative for HSV 2 < .90. 

Finally 3 months prior. Exactly a year ago. February 2021:
HSV 2 IgG 1.11 positive 
Supplemental test positive

Wait, what?

How did I never notice this before? And my doctor certainly didn’t see it or if he did he didn’t mention it. 

How do I go from being confirmed positive even with a supplemental test, to being negative for a year, to back to being positive again with a supplemental test?

All I can deduce is that this test is severely unreliable. Right now I’m planning to get a Western Blot to confirm. But has anyone else ever experienced this before?

Pro tip: Have a spray bottle when peeing to dilute your urine as you are peeing, it helps a lot when going to the bathroom. Standing in the shower also helped a lot. And ICE PACKS ON ROTATION. Just put paper towels between the ice pack and your genitals. Lidocaine is also purchased at any pharmacy and helps numb your genitals. I got the spray and the cream.

t91r5g,"Being black with GHSV(F24) I got connected with a black pharmacist in my community through my mom who had been trying to help me find some help for my outbreaks to help them become less frequent. They have a ton of non-traditional hand-made treatments for many different things. 

Anyway this lady was super sweet and super supportive giving me tons of advice and assuring me that everything was going to be ok. She even shared with me that she is positive with GHSV1 as well and that she has been able to manage it in such a way that she no longer gets outbreaks and has not passed to her husband(that she knows of). This made me feel a lot less alone and assured me that things would get better until she told me not to disclose. Ever. She said she never disclosed to her husband and she never will. She just takes care of herself to make sure he doesn’t get it. She told me not to tell anyone. Even friends. She said she’s seen many people get outed by friends and exes, so she warned me to keep it to my self. I obviously don’t agree with that and I was super shocked that this was coming from someone in the medical field. I wonder if this is because she’s older and we all know the elders in the black community don’t talk about things like that... But this really had me shook. What are y’alls thoughts?

Also, if you’re black, what is your experience dating with HSV? The stats show that the black community is disproportionately affected by HSV, especially black women. And the stigma within the black community is crazy. Do you disclose?",56,2022-03-07 17:44:52-05:00,"Hi I am a black 23 year old bisexual male with GHSV2 and i have gotten similar advice from medical professionals about not disclosing. I think what needs to happen is we need to stop viewing this condition as embarrassing and instead just a skin condition that came from sex. I do think we should disclose to all our partners but people do be mean and might use that info against you. It just has to come to a point where you're not ashamed of it so it can't be used against you. I'm not at that point yet but I want to be. 

The stigma in the black community is crazy considering how prevelent it is for us specifically. I think the stats say around 35% of African American adults will have genital herpes and 45% of Black women will. Even with how common it is we still find a way to shame each other and ourselves for it. It makes no sense but that's how it. 

Dating for me has been hit or miss. I date mostly black men and women and I've faced some rejection for it but not too much. Most people appreciate the honesty of me disclosing and I know all the facts and can answer all their questions. People are attracted to confidence and honesty and if you disclose it shows you are honest and confident that regardless of any condition you are worth being loved. 

Also GHSV1 is very rarely contagious because HSV1 doesn't like to shed in that area so make sure to let your partners know that if you plan on disclosing. Because of what I know I don't think disclosure is 100% necessary but I do it basically to keep the relationship honest. I wish you well in everything though. ### Black girl here!  
I have OHSV1 & GHSV2. My oral is asymptomatic. I’ve had 4 or 5 genital outbreaks. I take lysine & I’ve been on suppressive antivirals since day one until recently. I posted the other day about weaning myself off of antivirals. I now take 1,000 mg lysine & 1 antiviral pill a day will hopes of stopping my antivirals altogether soon. As for lysine, in mine & many other peoples’ opinion, it is a miracle pill. Really helps. 

Disclosure is really up to you. When I got diagnosed my dr said it’s not necessary. If you feel comfortable telling & feel like you should then go for it. If you don’t then don’t. I get the black community fear but fuck em. A lot of our people are overly judgmental & open mouthed when in reality so many people have herpes & most of them will never know. Black women in particular are one of the groups most affected by HSV. We don’t get it on our own. It’s crazy how childish & uneducated our people are when herpes is so prevalent in our race. 

It’s totally possible too to date without passing even with regular unprotected sex. I don’t have a steady partner but I still have casual sex when I want. I have my regular partners then I have someone new once in a blue moon. Most of my partners know. Some don’t. I have HSV+ on some of my dating profiles. The others I don’t. I just stopped putting so much stress & thought into it. I also haven’t had any outbreaks either since I started feeling that way. Herpes is way too common for me to be stressing or worried someone’s going to call me a name lol. I’m 30 years old. High school was well over a decade ago. ### Black hsv2 positive 25f here! It’s sucks to say but i agree with her. Our race is probably the most judge mental when it comes to these things because they aren’t educated enough and it’s scary. I haven’t told a single soul. People may act like they’re okay with it and once something hits the fan they’re ready to spill all your business! & that’s something i just couldn’t handle. I’ve had this diagnosis for almost 2 years and I’m still going through the trials & tribulations so that would just be more stress. Going through this alone is tough now imagine everyone else making you feel worse. As long as you’re doing everything in your power to stop outbreaks and transmission i don’t think you have to tell anyone. The only fucked up thing would be knowingly spreading it to people in my opinion. ### I’m white, and male, so cant speak too much to your situation but here are 2 support groups I belong to and the members of each are male, female, lgbtqia+, black, white, mix etc. Might want to stop by for the next virtual meetup.

So, think about how many have it and have not disclosed. Good luck to you young queen ### The stigma is indeed insane and irrational, yet the idea that it’s OKAY to not disclose is not the way to go. People deserve the right to be notified otherwise you are committing equal/more harm to those who will have to live the whole life with something that may or may not be okay with.

You do not have to disclose to people you aren’t having sex with though ### Black female, 30s. Have GHSV1 (also had 1 random oral outbreak a few years ago so maybe I have OHSV1 as well?!!). 
Anyway, I've had it since I was a child (don't know how I got it) but was diagnosed in college during a really bad outbreak. 
I don't think I told my college partner, mostly because I was in denial. I literally hung up the phone and said ""nope"" when the dr called back with my test results.

I only realized I had to disclose after a potential partner got pissed at me when it randomly came up. That's when I started to accept that I had it. 

Have a new partner, also Black. I disclosed and he's okay with it and we've been intimate a few times - with condoms and I take antivirals).

Yea the stigma is real - saw someone say ""ewww herpes"" on IG a few days ago *rolls eyes*

Funny enough, after I told my new partner, I felt more comfortable telling my best friend and sister. They were surprised but nothing else, hasn't come up since. 

It gets easier. Hang in there. ### Black girl here hsv2 and I’m 22 . I don’t shame anyone who doesn’t disclose . It’s up to them .

They also made out it wasn’t a big deal at all and seemed kinda bored of me being so upset about it, which was weird but speaks to how common is must be for health practitioners to see. 

I’ve started telling friends and it’s amazing how many have said yeah me too once you start opening up, the shame and feeling like I had a dirty secret was worse than the HSV symptoms - I fully expect word to go around as I live in a  small community but I’m hoping by being normal and chill about it other folks will too. 

You’ve got about 4% chance of transmission based on having sex twice a week every week, condom halves that and anti viral plus condom halves that again. I am pretty sure my current bf is part of the 2/3 of folk that have GHSV2 asymptomatically, we had unprotected sex for 2 months before I got it and we’ve had OB sex since and he’s not had a flare up. ### I'm a black female with HSV 1 & 2. I agree with the older lady. I feel like if I'm taking my meds like I'm supposed to and am careful when im intimate with someone, we should be straight. I haven't had a outback I don't think ever. But I want to be safe so I take my meds daily so I can lower the chances of spreading it. ### when i first got it. i disclosed to friends. how crazy it seems that my white friends all supported me and made me feel better. but my black friends said “ew wtf” and stuff like that lmao. so there’s that. i told them i was just kidding and didn’t have it bc their reactions made me feel bad so as far as they know i was “lying” it’s not like i’m ever gonna be intimate w them so i’m not gonna bother disclosing to them bc that’s not their business.

on the other hand, partners. some i disclosed to, some i didn’t bc i literally forgot and those were just one night stands so i just left it alone. i never got any texts saying i gave them something so i’m assuming i didn’t pass it. i just make sure i’m taking my meds, staying hydrated etc and if i’m having an outbreak no sex until i’m better. otherwise i just forget i even have it bc it’s not a big deal to me anymore. ### . ### Check your messages please ### What does it matter what race you are? Who cares! ### Thanks for sharing your experience and offering encouragement! ❤️ This has been so helpful. I totally agree, we definitely need to be having more conversations on this in the community and society in general. I think it’ll get better as time goes on and people get more educated.

As far as GHSV1 goes, I’d love to believe that’s the case but it doesn’t seem like there’s much research on the transmission rates so I’m not sure if I fully believe that. I know it sheds less than type 2 but can we really assume transmission is lower based on that alone? ### Hi! I appreciate you sharing your experience. I was prescribed suppressive therapy but I’ve recently stopped taking them because I’m worried my hair may fall out. I already have thin edges and I don’t know if they’ve gotten worse because I’m stressed or because of the antivirals so I’ve been taking lysine instead. I’m also taking a lemon balm supplement. I’ve still had a handful of OB’s since the first, but they haven’t been bad so I don’t mind quitting the Valtrex immediately.

 But I’m glad to hear you’ve grown to a point where the stigma doesn’t bother you as much. I feel much better than I did at the beginning which was only 3 months ago, so I still have a long way to go. I know my sex/love life isn’t over, I just don’t want anyone to look down on me or slander me for this. But maybe when I’m around your age I won’t care anymore either lol. ### [removed] ### How's it possible to have regular unprotected sex without passing it? Haven't seen anything online that gives that guarantee. Just curious on the actual real life facts rather than generics ### I understand where you’re coming from but I don’t think I could forgive myself if I passed it on to someone. But I know it’s really the stigma’s fault. It shouldn’t be this scary to disclose. ### Thank you! I appreciate this! ### Hi there! Thank you so much for sharing and offering encouragement. But yes. I’m always shocked to hear a medical professional say not to disclose. That’s so crazy to me because that’s how so many people get it. Without consent. Which is more traumatic than getting it on accident ### I 100%agree! ### Thanks for sharing your experience! You’re lucky you’re asymptomatic! I hope it stays that way! ### Thank you for this! ### I definitely agree! ### Thank you for sharing your experience! ❤️ I certainly hope it does get easier. I know it’ll be quite a journey. ### She just advised me to take the time to learn my body and what may be potential triggers and to avoid them. Keep your immune system up and avoid peanuts at all costs. That’s it 🤷🏾‍♀️ ### Thank you for sharing your experience! Do you have HSV1 and 2 genitally? ### Idk. The only thing I can thing of that’s worse than disclosing is having someone find out that you lied to them AND infected them with an incurable disease 🥴 ### Dang I’m sorry to hear your black friends reacted like that. Who knows, but they probably have it themselves and don’t know it! But I can identify with the how you told them you were kidding to save face. I did something similar to my friends, except they were really supportive and didn’t act like that at all. I told them I was misdiagnosed and that it was something else 💀. My mom and the pharmacist lady got in my head and made feel like I shouldn’t have told anyone 😭. I regretted it though so there’s only one of my friends who knows the whole truth 💀 ### you must be white. you don’t know how it feels to have HSV in the black community. mental health isn’t even taken seriously in the black community so just imagine having this virus in this uneducated community. it’s horrible. 

so yes race matter when the OP wants advice from fellow black people, their experiences etc. if you don’t have anything nice to say then shut up ### Good for you! The best thing you can ever do in life is what you feel is best. You’re making decisions that you feel work for you & I’m happy you seem to be getting over the hump of being positive. It’s way too common of a virus. There will always be those ignorant people that have something to say or deny you due to their misinformation or discomfort. Which is ok! For every person that says no there’s 5 more ready to say yes. Just don’t let the no’s discourage you. When you’re ready you’ll get out there & see it’s not so bad. ### Disclosure is ultimately your choice. You have to weigh out the pros & cons then ask yourself if you’re ok with the possible results from either side. My biggest piece of advice is not to worry so much what people think about you. Someone knowing you have herpes whether you were the one to tell them or not doesn’t change anything. As long as you are happy & know the truth about yourself who cares what anyone thinks or says? Kids spread rumors. Grown ups don’t let that stuff bother them. If I worried about every little thing people had to say about me I’d never make it past tomorrow. ### You absolutely can have regular unprotected without passing. I am GHSV2+ My 2 previous regular unprotected partners tested negative after we were together. Herpes isn’t active all the time. The biggest risk is when you’re having an outbreak. Someone here posted the other day about her long time partner testing negative after years of unprotected sex. https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/t7mkwz/my_husband_tested_negative/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf ### i don’t know the stats but i was talking to a guy for a few months after getting hsv2 and we had unprotected sex almost daily and i never passed it. i took antivirals and made sure i wasn’t having any outbreaks. i even had some random partners like 2/3 just casually and have not passed anything to them either ### It isn’t transmissible all the time , only during OB or viral shedding .  So if sex is avoided if there is an active outbreak & lucky enough to miss the viral shedding then it won’t be transmitted. Ghsv1 is supposedly less shedding days & as so many people have ohsv1 they are extremely unlikely to get ghsv1 as they already have the virus but in a different location. ### No problem!! ### Thanks ### Yep both downstairs, never had a mouth OB! ### Thank you I couldn’t have said it better myself! ### It shouldn't matter what race you are..
Why are you trying to seperate yourselves?
Where I live white and black people live in the same community. 
We are not as different as you think. 
Its the same in every community, regarding this disease. Trust me...we are no different ### [removed] ### The hsv1 could be oral and asymptomatic ### Stop being dense. Nobody is being divisive. Different races have different cultures, experiences, and norms. The black experience is not the same as everyone else’s, and as a white person you’ll never be able to relate to that and can’t speak on that. So this post is not for you. Everyone deserves a space to talk about unique experiences and everything doesn’t have to include you. Get over it 🤷🏾‍♀️ ### it’s not the same in every community. this post isn’t for you, leave. ### No problem! It’s really not so bad but your feelings are totally valid. I think most of us went through a dark period when we found out. It gets better. I will say if you ever feel comfortable, & you are close at all with your parents or family, tell them! I know it sounds weird but when I told my mom, who is also a nurse, I felt so much better. I don’t feel like I’m holding up some image of being a perfect daughter. She still tenses up when I talk about it sometimes but I’m so glad I told her & I know she appreciates that I felt comfortable enough to share something that was hurting me. ### Had a HSV1 OB years ago and no recurrences :) ### ",29,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/t91r5g/being_black_with_ghsvf24/
t9bmch,"Contemplating dating someone with HSV2 Hello all,

I came to this sub seeking advice. I was going to call a health centre to ask opinions but I figured my best first stop is people that know about this first hand.

I (F) just started talking to a guy. He disclosed that he has HSV2. I was very grateful he told me, and that I just needed time to read up on it before I move forward. He understands. 

Aside from the obvious (condom) what other precautions should I be taking ? Can I still get it with a condom, if he doesn’t have an OB? He’s had it for awhile and seems to have a good handle on what’s going on. He hasn’t had an OB in over 2 years but took anti virals when it happened. Has not taken anything since. 

Oral ? Is it off the table ? Can it be transmitted through kissing ?  Apologies for my lack of understanding around the subject ! 

Thank you :)",12,2022-03-08 02:41:22-05:00,"Great questions! HSV-2 has a 1/10 chance of passing male to female per 100 sex acts. Antivirals are 50% effective, condoms  96% effective. 

My girlfriend opted for no condoms, just antivirals. She joked in 20yrs we’d have to breakup, since theoretically, that’s when she’s likely to get it!

I think she figures if she found live for 20yrs, it’s be worth a minor skin rash. Can’t argue that!

You can’t catch GHSV-2 kissing or receiving oral. You could catch it giving oral.

You can catch it when no sores are present. That’s when people normally catch it. ### I just spoke with my sexual health centre to ask questions. They told me there is still a chance it can be passed while using a condom via asymptomatic shedding if I were to have any cuts Or anything down there. 

What is the actual percentage of this happening ? ### I read the well written posts by the gentlemen on here; now hear my thoughts as a woman who's had HSV2 for nearly 4yrs. I am negative for HSV1.

I would never engage in any physical sexual behavior with an infected partner - symptoms or no symptoms - and I have the virus in great supply to share according to my most recent IgG test.  I no longer seek a marriage partner.  I've finally reached the point with the virus where I don't have bi-monthly outbreaks and appear to be asymptomatic.  My diet had to change as the foods I ate caused outbreaks i.e.  chocolate, any nut, seeds, anything made from a grain i.e. wheat in Bread, cookies, cakes, quinoa, any rice, any noodle (goodbye Mac n chs), cheese crackers, any alcohol, coffee, onions, garlic, pizza, corn, watermelon, cucumbers, citrus, pumpkin pie and roasted seeds....You get the idea. I avoid restaurants.  I used to ingest a nightly protein shake - forget about it, too many amino acids, virus went crazy.  I also rarely ate meat or dairy, now I do everyday.  Plant protein is high in virus feeding amino acid Arginine.  I was an avid cyclist 🚴 - haven't biked in over 2yrs.  It caused physical stress on my genitals that guaranteed an outbreak - vicious cycle (no pun intended). Same with long distance hiking. I'm hoping it will be different this year now that I am receiving a professional weekly massage and acupuncture treatments.  So, if you're in a position where you can miss a lot of work or sit on a pillow at work cause you're in pain, go for it.  If you want to lose weight eating fruits, veggies, greens, eggs, salmon and dairy, go for it; I have the lovely figure of a skeleton.  If you're independently wealthy, go for it. This virus has cost me thousands of dollars in health treatments, testing, arsenal of daily supplements and will continue until it's eradicated.  I spend some time everyday researching or blogging on the subject. This is not what I wanted my life to be filled with day after day/year after year.  I could never live with myself if I gave this to someone with their permission or not.  I had a former fiance that came back and I rejected that man that I love to my core because I know the diet/lifestyle change would be too much for him.  I got it from a liar that was hoping I'd ""marry him now that we both have it"". ### Thank you for the response ! 

I’m most worried about catching it without sores present even with a condom. He has had partners in the past who have been comfortable with it and they never caught anything so I’m told which brings me some relief. ### What are the chances of a woman giving it to a guy through oral? ### Hey, I saw your post and wanted to give you an in-depth response to hopefully alleviate many of your fears.

I'm a 29M and have had HSV2 for over three years. I've had a total of four outbreaks (all in the first year). I haven't had any outbreaks since. This is how it is even for a vast majority of people that get this. Over 80% of people that contract HSV2 NEVER have ANY symptoms and are out there spreading this because they have no idea they have it. An estimated 1/6 Americans have HSV2. I'm guessing because of the way you spelled center that you're in Canada, the UK, or another commonwealth country. For those who have symptoms at first, the outbreaks decrease with severity and amount and eventually will cease entirely. It is, as is often described, a skin infection - one that doesn't decrease your lifespan or really affect your ability to have children (neonatal herpes being passed through childbirth is 3 times less likely than you giving birth to a child with down syndrome).

Having this myself, I can say that this is NOT a big deal at all and I do not get the stigma surrounding it. That's really the only problem IMO about having this - others' assumptions and stereotypes about the infection.

It's very possible you already have it or HSV1. Ironically, if this guy ONLY has HSV2 and didn't ever have HSV1 and you did, YOU could have given him genital herpes. I am in this boat, I tested negative for HSV1 when I got tested a few months back for my HSV negative partner.

The 1/10 figure previously given is a bit misleading. Women have an easier chance of contracting the virus due to having more ""surface area"" on the genitals. If you all have 2-3 sex acts per week, there is about a 10% chance of you acquiring the virus. Again, if you contract it - there is an 80% chance you never get ANY symptoms. Daily antivirals reduce the chances to about 5%. Condoms, conservatively, reduce the chances by another 50%; however there is research by Teri Warren that shows condom use may reduce transmission rates from M to F by up to 96%. Conservatively, the use of antivirals AND condoms will result in a 2.5% yearly chance - but we may be talking well under 1% due to condom use with antivirals. Oral with HSV2 is generally safe as it does not like the mouth area, but is still possible (but under 1%); use a condom at first if you're not comfortable.

Asymptomatic shedding (with no sores) IS responsible for up to 70% of transmissions, so YES, that IS possible, but again, this is hindered by taking daily antivirals and condoms. Also, if he is asymptomatic, shedding rates plummet dramatically after the first year. People without symptoms shed less on average than those that still get outbreaks.

The vast majority of us on here that got it (90%+) was NOT from someone who disclosed and was honest with us; it was from someone who didn't know they had it OR KNEW AND LIED/NEVER TOLD. I was in the second boat; my ex-girlfriend knew she had it and didn't tell me out of fear I would have rejected her. If she had told me, I would have still dated her; her being honest with me and showing me all the precautions would have been a massive green flag for me and by taking those precautions I VERY LIKELY would not have it today.

This guy is presumably looking for a long-term relationship and by telling you this is communicating his desire to be honest with you, even with the chance that you turn him down as a result. Clearly, he's not looking to lie to you or mislead for the possibility of cheap sex; so many people pass this on or lie about it just to get laid. Consider that a MASSIVE GREEN FLAG.

Still, if you're hesitant, I recommend taking it slow with him and getting to know if you two are compatible. Sex is good, sex is great; but I'm taking it slow with a woman who is HSV negative right now because I desire so much more. Sounds like he does too. ### I’m so sorry to hear all that. I really am :(

Do you mind if I asked - were you guys using protection or no? ### Wow thank you so much for your detailed response ! I really appreciate it. 

Yeah I’m profoundly grateful that he told me. I think I will pursue this relationship I just needed some questions to be answered . 

I wish you luck in your new relationship as well! ### Hey brother can you give me a break down, about Ohsv1 and my girlfriend has it and I don’t want to break up with her for it. What is the transmission rate and just your knowledge you seem to know a lot you can Dm me too ### No, as supposedly we had both tested negative.  Turns out he knew he had previously been exposed so he chose to get a cholesterol test instead and lie to me.  All I saw was his arm with a  band-aid.  I trusted him cuz who would lie about it.  SMH ### Does she suffer with cold sores?  What is her IgG score?  You should be fine as long as she isn't kissing you when she feels any symptoms coming on.  I assume you've both tested for HSV1 & 2 before any physical relationship. ### Yess correct I dot have get score yet but she never get cold sores ### ",5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/t9bmch/contemplating_dating_someone_with_hsv2/
t9flfh,"Circumcision Hi, lately I’ve been thinking I (37m) should get circumcised. I’ve had herpes for over 5 years now and had constant outbreaks for a few years.
The outbreaks are mostly on the foreskin that if circumcised will be cut off. Secondly, a few mins or half an hour after masturbating, I release a bit of the thick leftover fluid and that keeps down there really moist. I keep going to the toilet to wipe and keep as dry as possible.
I think keeping it dry is the best I can do to prevent outbreaks.
I don’t have as many outbreaks now and starting on acyclovir soon so I can get back to finding a woman after all these years again.
Has anyone experienced circumcision due to herpes? If so, how has your experience been with the process and afterwards?
And for all you, you think circumcision can help decrease my chances of outbreaks?

My lip line is also itchy sometimes ever since, but no sores are appearing.
4 weeks went by and I tested for herpes an igg test.
The test results were negative for both types.  
Is it safe for me to have sex ?",14,2022-03-08 10:59:40-05:00,"IgG tests are most accurate 12 weeks after exposure. If you are worried you should test again at that point. If you get physical symptoms before then, get it swabbed as that's the preferred way of testing. Even after 12 weeks the IgG will miss 30% of hsv1 infections and show a false negative result. ### Google cheilitis. Also could have been lip ecsma 🤔. If it was in fact herpes then you'd have oral herpes which means you only have it orally. You can still have sex. Genital herpes is on genitals and transferred through sex. Oral passes on orally. Which could be kissing or going down on someone which could give them genital herpes but that's the only way. Also blood tests don't always come back positive. You realistically should have got it swabbed than blood tested. ### The bump I had wasn’t really a sore , it didn’t hurt, no puss barely even red and it only tingled the day it started , can that be related somehow to herpes? ### I feel like a swab isn’t a good option since it isn’t an open sore, there’s skin that is completely intact, no puss , no blood, just a weird swollen bump ### It's best to see a doctor for diagnosis really, impossible to do over the Internet and I'm not a doctor ### That's true. If nothing else appears doctors will probably just tell you there isn't much to swab but you should still go and ask what they think it looks like as it could be other things that I've mentioned or something different. You can even go to pharmacy and ask if they have anyone knowledgeble there which a lot of pharmacies do have. ### I can go to my doctor and ask him about it but he’s from a different country and there’s a slight communication barrier since he doesn’t speak my country’s language as well, so sometimes I feel like he doesn’t understand what I’m asking .
Also I’m super insecure about being a hypochondriac , people tell me I’m like that but I feel like my reasons to be worried about certain health issues are completely reasonable and realistic. So I just have this strange fear that I’ll visit my doctor and he’ll “laugh” at me for being worried about such a minor thing - the bump on my lip . and will dismiss me without any tests or medication ### I don’t want the nurses and my doctor at the clinic to see me as the weird young and healthy girl that has health anxiety and keeps asking for std tests over and over again ### Oh I personally used to think like that but now I go to doctors whenever I feel like something is wrong 😂. It's their job. You wouldn't be the only one to walk out perfectly healthy. Better to be safe than sorry is what I go by personally. It'd at least put you at ease and help you. ### Or maybe think I’m a slut for getting these tests all the time ### 😂😂 I'm sure they'd just think you're worried about your health and that's reasonable. Don't worry about what they'll think of you. They see a lot of stuff in their jobs and try not to judge people. I have a friend nurse and she is constantly worried about everything. Knowing more about what things could mean she's always like omg I think I have cancer 😂😂. This shouldn't be something you should be worried about. Who cares what they think. You hopefully won't need to see them again and they won't remember you :) ### Ok thank you so much for the support <3 really needed it .
Also there’s this guy that we’re supposed to hook up this weekend, and I honestly don’t know what to do about it with the herpes scare I’m having rn ### I'm sure by weekend you'll see if you have a sore or it is something else.

t94uz5,"For any one going through any sort of depression or has lost hope this post is for YOU! Just checking in to give you guys my success story with this and how I got my life back! 6 months ago I would’ve never thought I’d be back to this point until YEARS from now! So I feel like it’s only right that I share my story because I was just were a lot of you are emotionally not very long ago! 


So I was diagnosed with hsv genitally in about the spring of 2018. I was in college and had a girlfriend at the time and mistakenly slept with one of my exes who I didn’t know had gotten around after me the way she did until after. About to weeks later I had a small sore that turned out to be the big H. Still to this day I am not sure if it is 1 or 2 but I would assume 1 due to how many outbreaks I’ve had and them not being very severe. Don’t get me wrong I’ve had more than I can count since then but they’ve never been excruciating or debilitating in any way. 

When I was first diagnosed my girlfriend was having sores as well, yes I passed it to her during my initial outbreak when I was only having redness. So when I got the news and told her we really did not make a big deal of it. Everything was still the same for me life wise I never really thought too much of it. Yes I know I’m a terrible person for cheating on her and passing it, it is something I have to live with for the rest of my life knowing and I’m not sure if I’ll ever forgive myself for it. But it’s life and we all make our mistakes. 

From then I went on 1000mg valaciclovir that I’ve been on since. Me and my ex girlfriend broke up recently within the last year and over the summer I fell into the worst depression. I was at the lowest point of my life I feel like Forsure. I would stay up late at night on this thread reading other peoples sad stories and experiences and it made me feel so terrible. I was very suicidal but at the end of the day I knew I could never do that to my mother or my family. I came to realize that reading all of this stories day in and out was really a big cause of my depression. My life felt like a bad dream that I thought I’d never wake up from. My anxiety was terrible and every day I would wake up thinking “yet another day with herpes”. But I eventually took a break from the thread and my mental health slowly became better. I met a girl who honestly saved my life, she loves me for who I am and I wouldn’t trade her for the world (for all of the people that think that no body will ever want them you’re wrong!) she is negative and we have unprotected sex all the time and she is very okay with it. 


I recently have stopped having outbreaks completely. I was taking sea moss as well as black seed oil daily which I had no clue that either contain a high dose of arginine. Before I stopped taking those I was having outbreaks almost weekly. So in relations to that I want to share my vitamin regimen. 

Daily I take: 

1,000 mg valaciclovir
3,000 mg lysine 
Daily b12
Vitamin D 
Monolaurin (Must have!) 
Magnesium 
Zinc 

Since I’ve started the monolaurin it seems to be working very well!! 


One thing you have to realize is you are STILL the same person. No matter what you think!! The stigma is what really is bothering you and how people talk about it. Also sitting up reading the sad stories on here will do nothing for you! Everyone’s story is different and everyone has different experiences. Of course reading about someone saying they’re having constant outbreaks and how depressed they are about something you also have is going to make you depressed as well. It will only make you think “oh wow that’s just another negative thing about what I have to be sad about” that you weren’t even thinking about before!! It’s okay to be sad you made a mistake! But you must grow and keep going! Being sad all the the time doesn’t take or add to anything! 

Another thing you HAVE to realize is the stigma is what’s also causing you to feel sad!! This is a VERY common disease. I’ve heard about so many people in my town having it and it’s really made me think “wow so I’m not as alone as I think”. People are not open about having herpes but I can promise you a lot of people you know even your friends have it and you just don’t know. 

If you told me my mental health would be where it is today 6 months ago I would’ve laughed!! But it is. And I actually feel like myself again and the person I’ve always known! I mean I truly don’t even think about it anymore even when I’m taking my medicine! 

Whatever you have to do to get your life back DO IT! I am living proof that it can be done. If you have to stop drinking do it! Smoking, drinking coffee, chocolate then do just that! I know it sucks, but the biggest part of moving on is the mental aspect. I know a big trigger for me was dark liquor, I only drink tequila and vodka now with mainly tonic waters. (All of the sugars in the Coca Cola and other pops are terrible for you. Find out your triggers and remove them or atleast slowly decrease your intake.  I know the feeling of when that outbreak happens you just have the worst feeling about yourself and that you just want to die! 

I had to stop drinking coffee also because I was having so many consecutive outbreaks but since I’ve been on the monolaurin Im back to my daily coffee! I just make sure I pop two lysines before and I don’t even feel a tingle! 

Also drink WATER! Do not let yourself get dehydrated especially while on medicine it’s bad for your liver if you’re not hydrated.

If you have time getting a test done for your D and B12 levels may be a good idea if you’re one who’s having frequent outbreaks. From stressing so much over the summer I found out my b12 levels were so low and once I got those back up the outbreaks decreased to none. Stressing about your diagnosis will also cause outbreaks as I’m sure you all know but keeping those levels low is KEY

I recently had a conversation my ex who I contracted it from letting her know about it (she acted like she doesn’t have anything).
I had a lot of hate and resentment in my heart towards her from what she did to me and once I spoke to her it was like a whole weight was lifted off of me. (Just a side note for anyone who can relate)
It really helped me move on and gave me a lot of closure 



I know it’s hard and easier said than done. Im sorry if this post is a little all over the place and hard to read I tried to cover everything as best as I could lol. But I always promised myself once I got my life back I would return to the thread to share my success. Im not gonna sit here and say the cliche of “it gets better” but that not always the case. But if you’re willing to make the changes it will get better. You are that same person, you will still find love. But you’re not just gonna wake up one day and you’re life will be back to normal, you have to take it back! With full force.

for the ones going through this. You are not alone and you can turn this into a success story. Just like I did.

From one to another, to the ones hurting inside with no clue what’s next, you can win, I promise you.

t9ecfh,"A Herpes Love Story - Hope is out there! I was diagnosed with genital HSV1 at the emergency room (A&E) following a horrible outbreak when I was 20 years old (female). I had been with my boyfriend at the time  (22 m) for just 2 months. STDs are something I have always been precautious about because I received very good sex ed at school. Therefore, we only stopped using a condom when we became exclusive and he had confirmed to me that he had a negative STD panel and that he also did a further blood test as part of his medic training at university. 

My boyfriend at the time - let's call him Bill - was not very nice to me and had a whole bag of mental health and drug issues. I was planning on leaving him because I didn't want to get further involved with him and also because his behaviour was causing lots of tension between me and my friends at the time. My first sign of HSV1 was incredibly moderate - I just felt an uncontrollable itching but there were no bumps or lesions. Then, all of a sudden, one day, I looked at my crotch and it looked like road kill. My first outbreak was so bad that I could not even see my vagina. Because I had always practiced safe sex and was in a committed relationship, I assumed that I actually had an infected cut from shaving or some bacterial infection. Bill was with his family for Christmas at this point so I was left to handle this with my best friend Bruce who took me to the hospital because the pain was so bad I couldn't walk. That's when I found out I had HSV. It turns out that Bill was not cheating on me but instead lied to me about taking an std panel. I was furious at him and the situation and I felt like the world was crashing down on me and that I had no option but to stay with Bill or be alone forever. Truthfully, I don't even know if Bill gave me HSV because prior to our relationship, I had slept with a friend that I later found out had cold sores around the mouth and apparently genital herpes is typically transmitted orally. Moreover, Bill and I never had oral sex - he wasn't much of a giver! But I was with someone that accepted the diagnosis and took it as his own too and I wasn't sure I could find someone else. 

&#x200B;

Bill and I dated for nearly one year until he actually broke up with me. He could always tell that I was unhappy and only stayed with him because of my diagnosis. The breakup was incredibly difficult because I felt like no one else would accept me for my diagnosis. Around the time that Bill and I broke up, I started to get close to a guy in my friend group - Bjorn. Bjorn was also going through a breakup and we confided in and supported each other. We developed a very close and platonic bond and eventually romantic feelings for one another. There were so many moments where I wanted to tell Bjorn that I was in love with him but I was worried that my diagnosis would lead to him rejecting me and by effect rubbish our friendship due to the awkwardness. One night, Bjorn and I were hanging out and he kissed me. It was the most thrilling and exciting thing that has ever happened to me. In fact, before he kissed me, I had seen a shooting star and wished for it to happen. No one ever believes this part. After we kissed, I pulled away and told Bjorn about the herpes. I didn't want anything to continue without him knowing the truth. Bjorn was very and open and receptive to my concerns and said that he needed to do more of his own research to make a decision. We continued dating for a month where he extensively researched herpes to the point where he knew more about it than me. At this point I took a test to find out if I had HSV 1 or 2 since 1 is less transmittable and severe. I was surprised and felt so lucky when I found out I had HSV 1. Bjorn even took a test hoping that he had herpes so we wouldn't have to worry about any of this - he didn't. The research showed that if we take proper precautions, the chance of transmission is less than 1%. We have developed a routine - I take a suppressive course of acyclovir (400 mg x2 per day), every time we have sex we use a condom, we keep hand sanitizer by the bedside table so Bjorn can clean his hands after touching my bits and I check my vagina everyday to look for signs or symptoms. We also hold off from sex if I ever feel any prodromes. Bjorn and I celebrated our one year anniversary two months ago and I feel so lucky and thankful to be in such a loving and accepting relationship. Our procedure has become second nature and so rote that we don't even think about it. He has never made me feel anxious or ashamed of my diagnosis and i feel so lucky because I never thought that I'd be accepted in this way. 

&#x200B;

For anyone with a diagnosis worried about your love life - keep an open mind because there are people like Bjorn out there. You are not your diagnosis and someone will love you regardless - just be open, calm and have all the facts to help them make a decision.",0,2022-03-08 05:58:45-05:00,,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/t9ecfh/a_herpes_love_story_hope_is_out_there/

I know some people who have unprotected sex and didnt pass it along. ### Get an IgG blood test at the 12 week mark.  You can order it online and go to your local LabCorp for the test - no Dr fees or record.  I use  STDcheck.com or UltaLabs.com  as they're affordable.

>An IgG test is accurate. 

The accuracy of a positive IgG test result depends on the index values. This is explained on our wiki page on herpes testing: [LINK](https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/wiki/herpes_testing). OP's low-positive values are actually more likely to be false positives than true positives.

 >If you're worried it's a false positive, consider a PCR DNA test.

This is unclear but, since OP has experienced no symptoms, you must be suggesting a PCR DNA *blood* test -- which would not be at all appropriate for herpes detection. Herpes is not a bloodborne virus. It is very rarely in the blood stream. So a PCR DNA blood test would all but certainly fail to detect it even if the person definitely has herpes. 

Herpes blood tests work by detecting herpes *antibodies*, not by detecting viral DNA.

>take a look at the (REDACTED) in Australia website. I tried it for 9mos without success. BUT a friend of mine did eradicate her HSV2 in 6mos when she started it upon diagnosis from a swab test. Her first IgG test result was 2.89. 

That product is a known scam. There is no cure for herpes at the present time. Once a person is infected, the virus cannot be eradicated.

Statistically, your friend's hsv2 index value of 2.89 had about a 40% chance of being a false positive. Eg here's a quote from herpes expert Terri Warren talking about the false positive rate for an hsv2 index value of 2.88:

>at 2.88, there is probably a 40% chance that this is a false positive and 60% chance that this is a true positive

([Source](https://westoverheights.com/forum/question/hsv-2-igg-result/))

So it's possible that your friend's initial result was a false positive. Alternatively, there's a chance that your friend's initial result was a true positive that her follow-up test then missed (IgG tests miss 8% of hsv2 infections).

Please take some time to learn what you're talking about before providing advice to others here. ### [deleted] ### >Please Google search PCR test for Herpes DNA. It's a blood test offered at my local Lab Corp here in the USA.

Why are you asking me to Google it? I'm already familiar with the test. I explained why it would not be appropriate for herpes detection. 

>My friend had actual blisters that her Dr swab tested and told her it looked like Herpes on her genitals. She didn't get an IgG test til a few minutes the later. She is 36yo and I'm 60yo

So her first IgG blood test was done just a few minutes after her swab test? And she swab tested positive for hsv2, and her first IgG blood test was positive for hsv2 with an index value of 2.88, and then she later IgG blood tested negative after she engaged in that bogus treatment?

Positive swab tests are very highly reliable. So it appears that she does indeed have hsv2. That means that her more recent, negative IgG test missed her infection (which they do 8% of the time). There is no cure for herpes at the present time so if she swab tested positive for hsv2 then she still has it regardless of what any further IgG blood tests say.

If she thinks she got rid of it then you might want to encourage her to order the Western Blot blood test, which is currently the best herpes blood test there is. It accurately detects 99.6% of hsv2 infections. It is discussed on our wiki page on herpes testing: [LINK](https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/wiki/herpes_testing). ### With regards to my post, what do you think I should do. Should I get another igg test done ? ### >With regards to my post, what do you think I should do. Should I get another igg test done ?

I'm not sure because I don't quite understand your post. You wrote:

The first 2 sentences appear to contradict each other. It's unclear whether you were tested twice or three times. If you were tested 3 times then it's also unclear when the 2nd test was done. Etc. Please clarify. ### So I did a tests 4 months after unprotected sex. We both decided to get tested after and he tested negative, I tested positive at 1.27. I went to get another test 2 months after that and tested at 2.14. I'm scared that the jump in my igg like this means I'm positive. we can't ship blood in my country so I can't do the western blot.

I have only had one other outbreak around the age of 20. The Dr I saw told me I had oral herpes down below. I had open sores like people get in their mouths. My mom tells me she has no idea how I got it. I just had a baby girl and they had me take medicine to not give it to her and it just hurt so much cuz I didn't ask for this I didn't do anything to get it. 

I'm so confused and angry. How did this happen? How could I possibly get this?",32,2022-03-07 20:52:41-05:00,"Yeah I’m guessing you were told by the dr you had gen hsv1…is that right? Whatever it is, it does sound weird. I have heard you can be born with hsv but it doesn’t come out until a stressful point or something. That being said that would be very rare. Were you ever intimate with someone who had cold sores? ### I wonder if it’s possible to have caught it by touching someone maybe their lip or something or some object (like a cup someone drank from) that was contagious with your hands? And maybe touched down there from wiping going the bathroom or some times when kids are curious they play with their body? I only say that cause I know it’s contagious skin to skin even in areas not genitally or mouth. That’s the only thing I can think of but I don’t know how likely that is? ### So wait? You have HSV since your were 12 without any sexual act? What type? Are you sure it’s herpes? Have you ever been tested? ### Herpes can be passed at birth as well. You could have received it from drinking after someone with herpes too. ### So then maybe my mom passed it to me at birth. I do know this. I am an extremely sexual person I knew things I shouldn't have known at age 8 so I've been told. I was interested in sex at a very young age. The thing is, I have no recollection whatsoever of any sexual abuse in my past. ### Not that 'm aware of no, but even if I was that doesn't explain me getting an outbreak at 12 with no sexual activity going on other than a normal kid exploring their body ### I don't know either honestly but if that is what happened that's awful. I was just being a normal kid you know? ### I don't remember which one he said it was. I know there's genital and oral herpes. I have oral herpes on my genitals or I did when I was 12 and again when I was 20 and those have been the only times. When I got tested at my regular annual for the first time and they told me I tested positive for herpes I was in shock. There's no possible way I contacted it from anyone I wasnt sexually active at 12. I had only been sexually active with my bf when I got tested and he was a virgin as well with no STDs. I don't transfer it all my partners have been clean after sex with me. The Dr didn't believe me when I told him I hadnt caught it from anyone and it was infuriating he was acting like I was in denial when I was telling the God honest truth. ### correct me if i’m wrong but herpes is not spread on surfaces like drinks , the chances of the virus surviving on saliva on a hard surface outside of the body long enough to get in your body is so low they don’t claim this as a method of transmission. their must be skin to skin contact ### If she would have gotten it at birth she would have been extremely sick in the NICU. ### Auto inoculation is a possibility. You caught it orally & infected your own genitals. If your mother has ghsv and was having an OB during your birth you would have been exposed , but it is extremely dangerous & i believe it can be fatal for new born so if infected at birth then you would know it. ### So your saying you mom has gHSV? 
If you would have gotten it you would had been very I’ll in the NICU as a newborn. ### Exactly you didn’t know. You were just being a kid and many people honestly were just being kids when they got it too. I definitely wouldn’t be hard on yourself though ❤️❤️ ### It is a weird disease. Some doctors aren’t very knowledgeable about it. It can lay dormant in our bodies until one day boom it comes out. I wouldn’t worry how you got it anymore, it’s not going to change anything. Just figure out what type it is hsv1 or 2, oral or gen, take your meds and you’ll be ok. ### The HSV survived four hours in the tap water and 24 hours in distilled water. It is transferable through saliva and other bodily fluids.
A person can contract herpes as a result of skin-to-skin contact with someone who has the virus or coming into contact with their saliva. As a result, people can get herpes from kissing. ### I agreed with her statement that the doctor gave her medication to prevent the baby from having herpes. Meaning, herpes is transferable from the mother to the child at birth. ### Hmm, thats a good theory, he told me I got oral herpes on my genitals most likely from someone with oral going down on me but that wasnt possible. ### I know my mom got around and she wasn't always clean and she told me she had an STD while pregnant with me and then other times she said she didn't so I don't know honestly :/ ### That's true and that just males it that much more sad. Thank you for your input ### Alright, I do feel like I stress myself over it a little too much when I can't do anything about it ### It’s not from the saliva that it’s transmitted by kissing but the direct skin to skin contact. There is wealth of info & misinformation on how it’s transmitted. ### To clarify , antiviral is given to known ghsv mothers prior to birth. Around 36 weeks to hopefully reduce the chance of an outbreak at the time of delivery. It isn’t like hiv meds that are given to prevent the hsv in the baby. It is for the mothers benefit. C - section is an option also if the person has frequent OB. 
Of course it’s transferable at birth , but as the other poster stated hsv is very serious in new borns & if her mother was having an OB then she would have been put in nicu ward for observation , possibly for up to 2 weeks. ### It’s how most have contracted it but if you were 12 , not active & no sign of abuse then Dr. not listening to you will only be a source of irritation.  
It may remain a mystery your ghsv. ### Your mom could have ghvs2 and never had an outbreak. Ghvs can be spread from shedding of the skin which can happen without an outbreak. I wasn’t really sleeping with anyone at the time I had my first outbreak and not sure who I got it from either most likely because I was asymptomatic for the longest time. If you really curious you could ask her to get tested specifically for herpes because herpes don’t show it on a normal STD test. You have to specifically ask to be tested for it. ### Do you take medicine year round to protect your partners or no? ### Here is information for you...it's from oral secretion. The skin to skin contact means if sweat, saliva, or any other bodily fluid is present. Because you cannot just touch someone and they get herpes from you.

Herpes simplex type 1, which is transmitted through oral secretions or sores on the skin, can be spread through kissing or sharing objects such as toothbrushes or eating utensils. In general, a person can only get herpes type 2 infection during sexual contact with someone who has a genital HSV-2 infection.

Its just frustrating and confusing is all. ### She refuses to talk to me for religious purposes but I agree that would probably be the only real way to know ### Maybe you need to use better sources than web md.  You do not need secretions or saliva for the virus to be transmitted , no oral or genial secretions needed at all as is seen with asymptomatic viral shedding transmission.

t9blg1,"Just need some advice on how to proceed and for someone to hear my current situation. Hi there

I have been exposed to HSV2 on multiple occasions recently. For some context, I was seeing a girl who did disclose to me she had herpes in her genital area. However, it was more of a ""I have herpes..."" disclosure right before having sex; in my young male brain, I shrugged it off thinking it was only transmissible if sores were visible, and she did not talk about the implications/consequences of the virus after I asked if I should be concerned. Looking back, I wish I asked more questions and did my own research, and I wish she was upfront about the facts of herpes and which risks are involved (which may be naive to expect of another person, though I thought highly of her, but those two things should not be conflated...). We mostly used condoms (five times) - the last two or three times we had sex, though, I did not wear a condom. I asked if it was safe to not use a condom and she gave me the green light. To be completely real with you, I was only thinking about pregnancy risks - I essentially forgot about our (30 second) herpes conversation ... is it fucked up to say I forgot about it because we were in a sexual situation when she told me? Because my memory gets foggy when it comes to moments leading to sex ... After a few times of sex without condoms, she revealed to me that it is still transmissible without sores and that I should wear condoms for my protection. Obviously, I could have made the safe choice to always use condoms and to not rely on someone else for medical info, but it really fucked me up that she knew extensive knowledge regarding HSV2 and never communicated it with me despite having sex continuously. I can imagine that it would be difficult to have a transparent discussion about this type of stuff, but I'd be lying to you if I told you her lack of communication didn't make me feel angry or a bit betrayed. I'd like to hear your thoughts on this and whether I should take more accountability in general. Some important info is that she has never broken out, contracted it about 10 months ago, and she takes daily anti-virals (which is very responsible ... but also kinda a big deal, and I'm surprised she didn't tell me. All of this info was presented to me ... after having unprotected sex). 

Now (3 weeks since last sexual contact), I'm trying to decide on what's the most reasonable and responsible course of action for sexual encounters (with anyone). My understanding is that my chances of contracting HSV2 are really low (like, less than 1%) given the small number of sexual acts with/without a condom, her being on anti-virals, me being a circumcised male, etc. I have not broken out, and I plan on getting an IgG antibody test 6 weeks out from the last sexual contact. The most responsible thing to do would be to abstain from sex and wait 12-16 weeks for the IgG test or even the western blot, right? Or is that .. overkill? Is there such thing as overkill for this situation? I'm just looking for some guidance from anyone that's been exposed to HSV2, and some help to ease the emotional turmoil and be more present (for all parties involved. It's especially hard for her, too). 

It's crazy how much misinformation is out there. I saw a nurse practitioner just to chat about HSV after this ordeal, and he told me that I shouldn't be concerned at all given she does not have sores. That's straight BS, right? Most HSV2 is transmitted asymptomatically to my knowledge ..

Anyways, if you've read up to this point, I appreciate you. 

Peace",7,2022-03-08 02:39:39-05:00,"So female to male tranmission is super low, transmission with no outbreak is much lower then with an outbreak (the reason most people get it from asymptomatic carriers is because if you’re having an outbreak you most likely aren’t going to have sex with someone ) and with antivirals the tranmission rate is down to almost nothing. 

As far as taking responsibility the ball was in your court to ask follow up questions. She did her job she told you what she had you chose to proceed. It’s your body and your health it’s up to you to ask follow up questions. My last 3 disclosures went like this with 0 follow up questions and it was because the guys had prior knowledge so she just probably thought you already knew about it. Her tranmission rate is so low that it wasn’t that big of a concern for her to show you a whole power point presentation like its health class. ### Do you know for a fact it was hsv2 ? You mentioned she said genital herpes , did she mention the strain or have you asked. ?

Have you ever been tested for hsv 1 or 2 before ? Do you know your status prior to this encounter ? ### To answer your actual question:   You can go your entire life and not get a type one or type two herpes. 

All you need to do is talk to the person beforehand and ask them if they’re comfortable getting tested. It’s literally as simple as that. 

Test whoever you’re with, before you have sex. You’re literally immune to all STDs for the rest of your life that way. Easy Peezy. ### Thanks for your input.

But I still could have ... not had sex .. lol. Easier said than done ... ### After she kinda spilled the beans, she told me hsv2 (i didn't know there were different herpes strains). I  only got tested after our encounters and actually tested positive for hsv1 (IgG), most likely orally, but have never had an outbreak. Will get tested at 12 weeks for hsv2 again ### As testing is currently not nearly 100% accurate it’s factually incorrect to say that just testing a person prior to having sex will somehow make you immune for life from STIs .  

There are other factors that you are not addressing in your “ Easy Peezy “ , false negatives is a big one , you & them having to leave at least 12 weeks between each person you kiss .  

One of the reasons the CDC and other world wide health bodies have not recommended testing of asymptomatic people , it is just not accurate enough to provide information to have the ability to avoid hsv . ### I’ll attach some facts about herpes so maybe you can learn more about it! It really isn’t a big deal.

t99581,"Just Infected from SO Whom I Knew Was HSV+ Hey Everyone,

So as the title points out, I've been dating a wonderful person who disclosed while dating, and before being intimate, that they were HSV2+. I decided I wanted to date them more and after realizing how awesome they were, decided to make the relationship official.

I accepted the risks and believed they were well worth the risks. 

Well it just so happens that I recently had my first outbreak even though we've used condoms every single time. But you know what, I really don't care because 1) it doesn't change anything about my character nor our relationship and 2) we can now be fully intimate without a piece of latex separating us.

What I'm wondering is this; should I even bring up the fact that I was infected by them? I got an IGG test before the relationship and was negative (+1 month ago), just got swabbed  from first outbreak and was positive. So I'm 99% certain I got it from them.

On one hand, I don't want to mention it at all because I don't want them to get down on themselves or feel guilty at all. I've had an easy time accepting it because I did extensive research on the subject before being diagnosed and still accepted the risk.

On the other hand, I know how much they struggled when they were diagnosed considering they weren't in a situation where they could decide if the risk was worth it (let's be real, not using a condom with someone whom you don't know their sexual health is accepting risk). My SO has said plenty of times that they didn't sign up for this and then here I am, having signed up for it. I feel guilty saying this, but I can't help but feel like they somehow are better or in a more powerful position considering they didn't *sign up* for it.

Is this something I need to be upfront and honest about? Or can I carry on and act like nothing happened? Because in reality, nothing has really changed and I could spare someone some unnecessary sorrow.

Obviously, in the end, it will come down to me deciding. I'd love for anyone's insight.

Thanks for your help.",9,2022-03-08 00:03:36-05:00,"I would tell them! It’s your partner you should have open communication.

They will probably feel worse but if it is a good relationship you can work on it and who knows, even become closer. ### just curious what your first outbreak has been like so far? ### Will do.

t9b16i,"First bout with genital HSV1 Dealing with my first outbreak of herpes. 
Received oral sex from someone, and about a weekish later my symptoms started.

It started with pain during urination and some red skin under my foreskin, and then noticed that some dots were appearing around the tip of my foreskin and down onto the shaft a little bit.  I also have an open patch on the head of my penis beneath the foreskin.  It’s quite uncomfortable!
I got tested 3 days ago with a swab on the patch beneath the foreskin, and the results came back as showing HSV1: Isolated, HSV2: Not Isolated

Just wanted to post here to see what I might expect, as this is my first time dealing with this.  My first symptoms started about a week ago.

I got herpes from a one night stand and the girl that gave it me I haven’t even spoke to her and I’m very sure it was her because that’s when the out breaks started I’m currently having a out break now which is my second one but I feel like it will maybe go without taking any medication should I do this or go back to the doctors I also noticed a spot inside of that area that looks permanent this shit is sad 

If I take medication daily is there a lesser chance of me not passing on herpes ?",4,2022-03-08 00:37:37-05:00,"Hey I understand the depression I was depressed for years until I finally decided enough was enough. I have been diagnosed for 10 years and have had  20+ partners since diagnosis. None of them to their knowledge have genital herpes some had cold sores. I am currently with a guy who is completely HSV negative he works at a blood lab and took a test just for shits and giggles.  He knows about my herpes I just closed and he is completely fine with it and accepts the risks. There are plenty of people like this who do not care. Sitting around and waiting for a cure it’s silly you’re rejecting yourself before anyone even has a chance to think about it or reject you or accept you. You are putting limits on yourself before giving anyone else the opportunity to consider anything. People get rejected every day for a plethora of different reasons Sure there are people who ghosted me especially on tinder but as I talked to my friends I realized they got ghosted too and it wasn’t because of herpes it was because dating apps are cesspools in general. Dating nowadays sucks for so many reasons if you want to pin it on herpes go for it but that’s not the only reason. I was diagnosed with ghsv-1 at 19 and I thought my life was over I didn’t tell a soul cut off friends and everything because I felt so disgusting and gross. But eventually I put myself out there and had a few positive disclosure s and i began to realize that I was the one creating the stigma for myself.. The more people I told the less it weighted me down. Think of it logically friends should care because it doesn’t effect them. The only people your herpes effects are the people you are sleeping With. Friends are supposed to be your support system and if you tell them your story they should not judge you And they will learn from you And your experience. Hell you May even help a fellow herpes person out becuase if someone discloses to your friend after you teach them about herpes they will be more understanding and knowledgeable about it.

I have sensations down there nearly every day of my life so technically I’m in a constant state of OB.

I have lost interest in everything. I have no will to live. I have contamination OCD and a disease that will forever be on my body. I don’t even feel comfortable showering….I’ll never have a sex life after this. I’ve had someone in my family commit suicide and I’ve ruled that out as an option, but im desperate for something to take away the pain of life.

All it does is stops you from having sex once and awhile when you have your OB (outbreaks), bring some discomfort (obviously this is case by case since everyone goes through things differently) whenever you have an OB and it's not life threatening at all.

[The Truth About Herpes!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y18AwEnYdP0)

My little sister's friend has had herpes since middle school (15+ years). She has a normal sex life with her boyfriend of 3-4 years, they don't like condoms so they have unprotected sex. He gets tested once or twice a year and has been negative ever since. She just makes sure to take her daily suppressant pills which reduce chances of viral shedding which is when you can transmit without having an active OB, it also helps suppress the virus making you have less outbreaks. She also takes things such as Zinc and L-Lysine which are immune boosters because low immune system moments are typically when you are at your most vulnerable to have an OB, she eats somewhat healthier, works out a few times a week and she hasn't had a full blown outbreak in over 6 years or something like that.

I think you should do some reading and if the pros of the relationship outweigh the cons of this skin condition in your head then you should 1000% continue the relationship but obviously everyone has their own opinions on this. ### Most of the world has hsv1 including children and don’t even know it. ### I understand it may be worrisome at first but hey, she was honest, which leads me to think she’ll let you know when she has an outbreak (OB) and the risk of contagion is greater. 

I’ve had it for over a year now. I’ve had intercourse when I’ve felt my skin was healthy (I’ll be using protection till the day I day, of course), and my partner has never shown any symptoms. The key is for her to know herself and recognize when the virus is or isn’t active. 

Always, always use protection. ### Think about it this way:

- Assuming you guys only engage in oral sex while she isn’t having a current outbreak AND she’s currently on medication, it’s a low probability of getting it.

- About 50% of the population has HSV 1. Roughly 12% of people have HSV 2. If she isn’t the first person you’ve had any sort of sexual contact, odds are you have already engaged in sexual contact with someone who has it.

- 80% of people with HSV 1 or 2 are asymptomatic or only experience one outbreak. So even if you do catch it, you are VERY LIKELY not to experience ANY symptoms.

- even if you aren’t in that 80% of completely asymptomatic people, the remaining 20% tend to still have relatively few outbreaks (1-3 per year).

- Outbreaks get less severe and last shorter durations the longer you have the virus. I’ve had herpes for almost 4 years and for the past 2 years the most I’ve gotten is 1-2 non painful lesions a couple times.

- You could already have it. As I said before, the majority of the population has either HSV 1 or 2. 80% of people who have it never experience symptoms. So you could very well have it and not even know.

Taking all of that into consideration, if I found someone I truly loved, the risk wouldn’t be enough for me to leave. I would stay with them. However, if that risk is to high for you, then ultimately the decision is yours. ### Thank you very very much ### What type does she have ? ### So would you date someone with it ? If you don’t have it ### Even if it’s just oral ### Do yo use protection for oral sex BJ ### Anytime! I wish you all the best of luck and if you ever have questions this group has been a huge help for me, don't hesitate to ask. ### Absolutely. I have. ### Would you look at that, all of the words in your comment are in alphabetical order.

I have checked 627,730,351 comments, and only 128,356 of them were in alphabetical order. ### if you’re afraid of low chances, you should, and use 2 diff condoms, 1 for oral and 1 for anal / genital. ### Does that stuff work for Ohsv1 the medicine volrax and the supplements? ### Do you have it ? ### What ### I would assume so since OHSV and GHSV are typically the same exact thing and you get outbreaks most when your immune system is at a low. From what i've ready most people get outbreak when they are on their period, when they are stressed, sick.. basically whenever your body is focusing on another thing. I had my first outbreak a week ago (3/1 maybe had some 2/28), i've been on Valacyclovir 1000mg twice a day and the 8 lesions that I got down there are completely cleared up and gone since this morning. I just ordered the supplements from Amazon 3 days ago and have been taking those along with a daily mens vitamin and the medication and like I said everything healed up very quickly. I get the blood work done the first week of April because my general practitioner said she wanted to wait to allow the proteins, white blood cells and anti-bodies to build up because a ton of time you will get a false negative because that is exactly what they test for versus testing for the virus itself.   
But when I had my OB and my partner had her OB we both were visually diagnosed to be positive. 

If I am for sure positive I will 100% be getting the daily suppressant medication just so I reduce OBs and if I do ever end up getting into another relationship I want to make sure I have the least amount of chances of spreading it on to someone else. ### I do now - everyone gets cold sores.
But I had people with it my whole life and only got it when I was severely immunocompromised with cancer last april. ### ",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/t9638r/ohvs1_advice/
t93rsr,Can you get ghsv 1 from someone with Ohsv1 ,40,2022-03-07 19:22:34-05:00,"yup that how i was gifted hsv1 ### Yes that’s how I got it. ### Download the herpes handbook pdf from the westover heights clinic. It's free and has loads of statistics about hsv and how to avoid it.

If you play safe and your gf is intune with how her body is feeling, you can have a normal sex life. There is always a risk you can acquire hsv1 mind you (unless you already have it and are asymptomatic- that's very common too!).

I highly recommend you educate yourself first, if necessary talk to a specialist sexual health doctor or nurse, before you continue being physically intimate in this relationship.

Hsv1 is the most common strain of hsv currently being diagnosed in genital outbreaks at the moment, because modern trends mean a lot more oral sex. Hsv1 does not spread easily from genitals to genitals but it does spread easily from oral to genitals and genitals to oral, and its possible even with no outbreak present. ### This person never had  a outbreak either, but was tested ### [removed] ### This is why it’s clear herpes is something people are so uneducated about. It can survive on ANY part of the skin. Which means it can be transferred to ANY part of the skin. Hands, eyes etc. 

Hsv1 is oral herpes. That’s it’s origin. So somewhere down the line it got transferred to someone’s genitals. ### Yeah. It happens. Several people I know got it that way. But honestly without an active sore the risk is super low. Just make sure you’re with someone you trust. I have Ohsv-1 and have never transmitted to a partner and love going down. But I’d never do that if I have an outbreak. ### [removed] ### Yes that’s how I got mine! ### What is the transmission like do you tell people ? Idk my girlfriend that we got tested before sex has it, I don’t know if I should break up with her or not. Do I take that risk of getting herpes ? ### I will thank you for the information Anx taking the time out to help me ### I thought it was pretty difficult for gHSV1 to spread to oral because it was already weaker and doesn’t outbreak/shed as much (possible, but not that common)? ### Does that mean from mouth and if they do oral on me I’m a male ? ### Thats the male to female transmission rate I believe and its a little higher than that with meds and a condom. Female to male is much less likely, about 4% without protection, but that's for ghsv2 not hsv1. ### Comment removed due to misinformation. There aren't any solid stats regarding oral-to-genital or oral-to-oral hsv1 transmission. ### What about with meds ? ### [removed] ### Comment removed due to misinformation. We don't have stats for oral-to-genital hsv1 transmission ### I just got it two months ago from my bf that didn’t know he could give it to me like that he thought cold sores were different and didn’t know they could be passed with no sore present.. it’s really up to you on that decision no one can make it for you. ### No worries. 

Remember it's okay to have preferences, you shouldn't feel bullied into being sexual with someone out of a sense of moral obligation. If you are not OK with the risks associated with sex, you shouldn't be having it. 

Most people do not educate themselves about hsv or their own hsv status, until it is too late. That said, hsv is not a death sentence and it is not a life sentence to celibacy. It is not the monster modern society makes it out to be and I think the more you research it, the more you will realise how common it is and how stupidly stigmatised it is.

Remember as well, having a relationship with someone who is hsv positive and knows it, is far, far, far, far safer than having a relationship (or multiple relationships) with a person who does not know their status. If you do indeed decide this relationship is not for you, be prepared to ask about the hsv status of every other person you become intimate with, and be aware that to get an honest and accurate answer from them you may need to educate them yourself (and they may not want to deal with that). I'm dating a girl currently who has outright refused to test herself for hsv on the basis that she has had no symptoms and she won't take a blood test for fear of false negatives/positives. You will need to ask yourself if you can accept that from other partners and if that is worth leaving a relationship for. ""Better the devil you know than the devil you don't"" and all that. ### Yes that's true in terms of shedding. Genital hsv1 sheds very rarely. I think it ""likes"" to live orally though; it's not like having ghsv2 which sheds a lot but doesn't ""like"" the oral area so doesn't spread easily to oral (although it possible), that's what I meant by that statement. Sorry for the lack of clarity! ### you should do your own research herpes is very ambiguous theres a lot of factors involved ### [removed] ### Inference from the type 2 study since they are closer in stats. Someone else on the sub had be using the same stats there isn't any available data on the transmission rate of oral herpes. ### Also, the 10% you are getting is from everyone inferring from the type 2 study as well since again, there is not any recorded studies of OHSV-1 transmissions. ### Comment removed due to misinformation. ### Yes it sucks because I don’t know if I will be with person for life and I love them, and don’t want to let them go ### You seem very educated 

What is the im a male my partner is female, her igg test was postbut the igm for herpes one was negative, she told me she kissed her friends and her ex boyfriend of 3 years never got nothing. 

If she if on votlerax and feels nothing is it safe to have sex 

And should I avoid oral sex completely 

She has Ohvs1 

And if you don’t mind me asking do you have hvs and your partners don’t ? ### What’s your opinion, would you date someone. With this risk ? ### Can you explain more ? If you can and want to I would like to hear ### Comment removed due to misinformation. ### With 70 % of population having it , chances are your next partner & one after that will also have it. Also test with no OB isn’t that accurate , you could test negative but test has a 30 % false negative rate. ### IgM tests are very unreliable and should never be used for diagnosing, pretty much just ignore them - however what they can show you is if the infection is recent. As her IgM is negative and her IgG is positive, its very likely she has had hsv for a longer time. Have you seen cold sores physically on her face? Do you know her index score for her IgG result? I ask this because false positives are quite common with IgG blood tests, but only really if the score is low. If she has physically had cold sores though, then yes she has herpes.

Did her IgG come back as negative for hsv2? Presumably she has no genital symptoms?

When she says her friends and boyfriend never got anything, how does she know? Were they all IgG tested 12 weeks after their last exposure (which is how long it takes for antibodies to develop and for the IgG test to be most reliable)? Remember hsv most commonly shows no symptoms at all. Which is why so few know they have it.

Is she on daily valtrex or only during outbreaks?

Daily suppressive therapy is supposed to cut down the total number of days where viral shedding occurs, but it's not going to cut that down by 100%. Unfortunately any sort of prodromes (tingling, itching before sores occur) are by definition ""symptomatic"" and the virus will most likely be shedding when she feels these symptoms and when the cold sore develops, all the way up until it is fully healed. Some people recommend waiting a week after the sore has fully healed before continuing intimacy. This is all great for watching out for potential shedding, however, on the other hand asymptomatic shedding occurs with no symptoms at all. It's almost completely random and studies have shown its impossible to predict. Luckily it doesn't happen that often, but since there is no way to tell, you may think ""ah she has no cold sore and no prodomes so she must be fine"", only for her to then transmit the virus. Unfortunately this is more common than you might think, with many people on this sub having contracted genital hsv from an Asymptomatic partner.

I think oral sex with antivirals and use of a condom would be as safe as you possibly could be, but I don't know anyone personally who would put up with protected oral sex long term in all honesty. Her taking daily antivirals should help protect you, but it's not 100% guaranteed.

The good-ish news is that genital hsv1 infection is usually one of the least severe, with outbreaks dropping off after a year or two for most people (some people are not so lucky). Studies have shown hsv1 genitally is far less contagious than hsv2 genitally, sheds less (especially after 2 years) and OBs less frequently. Some people with genital hsv1 will have one OB and then never experience one again. Genital hsv1 is extremely hard to pass to another person's genitals, unlike hsv2. So if you did contract it genitally from oral sex from her, then it could be worse. If you contract it orally from kissing her and get cold sores, it's not really seen as an sti by most of society and there tends to be less stigma around oral hsv than there is about genital.

Have you yourself been tested for hsv?

This is all about risk tolerance, which is why it's essential you do your reading about hsv to make up your mind.

Yes I have genital hsv, I have had it over 10 years. I have had girlfriends who have had cold sores - none of them actually told me they got them until they popped up, except for one ex who told he she got cold sores but then had no idea cold sores were caused by herpes. She'd been happily giving head to guys with no idea she could pass hsv to their genitals. At this point I'm not really fussed by hsv anymore. If my gf had cold sores, as long as they weren't active on her face I would happily accept oral and kissing and take the risk (I've already got hsv though, so it's not like it would make a difference for me. Although if I was as educated about this as I am now, and didnt have hsv, this would still be my view). Most guys I know though don't have hangups about cold sores and would not turn oral down just because the girl had a cold sore at some point in her life. ### Yes, if I genuinely like her ### I’m finding out a lot of information 


She told me as a kid she would be sick and has cold sores then, but the weird thing is, she would get tested with her ex boyfriend for 3 years probably about 4 years ago, and she told me his test was negative and her test were negative. 

Yess her igg hsv2 is negative 

No, I don’t have that information about her friends and boyfriend 12 weeks after but they never got sick or cold sores, not very helpful information lol 

She just found out a week ago, I want her to get tested again because the lab did there was issues and the test came back longer then it should have, I want her to get that medication if we I decide and we have sex and kiss 

I’ve know her for 2 years and never seen a OB 

To be honest I’m ok with Ohsv and the risk I’ll have to take 

But I’m scared of getting both if we kiss and have oral the same time 


I haven’t had no contact with her yet, she tests her partners before having sex, 

But has kisss guys and girls without test 

It’s just weird because hers she said we’re always negative and now she’s Ohsv1 positive ### I will get her tested again maybe she is negative, and it was a mistake, because no outbreaks. She had other test before that were negative and I never seen the igg test, I seen her igm and she’s in Colombia. They test on a doffrent scale it’s out of 25 her igm was 3.2 

I can show you the test if you would like to see and help me out 

Just weird  she asked her doctor to look at the exams and he said the igg was positive, but she never showed me a test for igg 

I don’t know if she hiding it but she told me it’s positive so I don’t know why she would hide they and tell me 

Her doctor said it’s no big deal but I don’t trust doctors ### So the most recent test came back as positive you mean?

Even after 12 weeks of exposure, an IgG blood test misses 30% of hsv1 infections. So even a negative result can be problematic and false. That's why they dont recommend you test unless you have had symptoms. It is always preferable to swab symptoms when they appear, rather than get a blood test. ### Check Dm brother, I really appreciate you thank yo iso much ### ",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/t93rsr/can_you_get_ghsv_1_from_someone_with_ohsv1/

If you get cold sores you most likely have hsv1 yes, although hsv2 can also cause oral cold sores. 

They say if you have hsv1 in location you can’t get the same strand in a different location after your infection is well established. But I’ve seen many people whom that has happened to

Kissing you would absolutely not make them get it on their genitals.

Not 100% but risk would be extremely negligible.  Also days of viral shedding is very low with ghsv1 so that makes it even less likely. Advice would be no sex during OB.

t8w4ss,"disclosing can be case by case hey there, i had posted a post a while ago asking about when and how to disclose if all im doing is casual hook ups, i didn’t get any answers but i had reached out to friends, talked to my therapist and here’s my conclusion.


disclosing is case by case.


i say this because quite frankly you can’t just trust that someone will be understanding, compassionate, or accepting. it’s just not realistic. some people are actually very mean or may even want to cause harm to you just because of what you have. i have night terrors about being publicly shamed by this guy i told who didn’t take it well. this is why disclosing can be scary especially if you don’t know the person.


so i had another guy that i had been hooking up with and decided not to tell him. we use protection and im religious about my medication but i just decided to keep it to myself. im doing everything i can to protect him and i told myself “im doing my part, that has to be enough” but even with this situation i feel kind of guilty for not letting him make a choice about whether or not he wants to have sex with me but we haven’t even had a conversation about stds or stis so it’s something that i don’t even really think he is concerned about? i had a crying fit last night about how i hope i don’t pass it on to him and how i don’t want to ruin his life. i also just got really frustrated because i hate that i have this. im not ashamed but it sucks, nothing about it will ever be easy.



all in all, my point is that having HSV is hard! and disclosing is just as hard. that’s why i don’t think there is a right or wrong answer when it comes to disclosing. a lot goes into play. like how well you know this person or how comfortable you feel around them or what yalls intentions are. i just hope that makes some people feel better because at the end of the day it is our decision. and it’s not our job to educate anyone.",4,2022-03-07 13:40:54-05:00,"Listen, what it really comes down to? Is whether or not you are controlling your outbreaks. Yes there is sub-clinical shedding to worry about. But you can reduce the chance of giving it to a guy down to 1% if you just take some responsible steps. This needs to be included as part of your opinion on disclosure. If there’s less than 1% chance of you ever giving it to anyone, do you really need to tell people that you have it? That’s a decision you need to make. If you know anything about numbers or math however, 1% is 1%. But you have to be responsible about your infectiousness to others. You can control this through numerous steps that you can take. Including boosting your immune system with SADBE if necessary. ### no yeah i agree with that of course, you should do everything you can to protect others! ### What is SADBE?

Every doctor i went to looked at my record and was like ""oh, you've got herpes. Yeah thats all it is"" leading me to think I was constantly having an outbreak but only twice ever with actual blisters. Because of this I was put on daily suppressants.

In February I decided enough is enough and went to another doctor- i travelled to go and see this one. I begged her not to just tell me it's herpes as everyone else did and to look for another issue as I just knew it couldn't be that anymore.

t8s8sm,"How do I confront the person who gave me HSV… I’m a (25f) who just had unprotected sex with a guy (28m) that I’ve been seeing for about a month now. We had sex twice in the span of the past two weeks and 2 days ago I noticed an abnormal lesion in my vaginal area. I went to OBGYN urgent care immediately the next morning and the doctor basically told me I have HSV. She put me on anti-virals in the meantime while I wait for my results which should be back any day now…

I don’t know how to approach him with this info and I won’t say anything until I have my results back and can confirm this… but I’m dealing with the initial shock/depression while knowing this is my situation… especially because I made the stupid decision to even sleep with this guy especially unprotected in the first place…. 

I’m embarrassed to say this, but I don’t even know him all that well which makes me feel worse. Don’t get me wrong I do like him and think he is a great person, but we were just starting to get to know each other and things aren’t really established between us so it makes this situation uncomfortable for me to have to address with him. We don’t talk all day everyday, but after the first time we hooked up he made a conscious effort to reach out to me and keep the excitement between us while we’re getting to know each other. 

Well last week we ended up going out together again and it was really fun. We ended up having sex again and I stayed the night, but this is where it gets weird. The next day he deleted all of his social media and I haven’t heard from him since. 

He’s been my first sexual partner in over a year and I haven’t started experiencing any symptoms like this until after hooking up with him…. I also have test results from my last annual check up a few months ago that confirms I was free of any STDs. I don’t even know how to approach this situation or how to reach out to him, because he’s completely fell off the face of earth since our last meet. 

I know I am to blame as well for not being smarter and asking his sexual history/health before sleeping with him…. But hey everyone makes mistakes so I’m not going to beat myself up. I would have been understanding and we could have taken measures to make sure that we could practice safe sex and do this the right way if he disclosed this with me. 

Obviously it’s wrong of me to assume, but I’m very intuitive and I just feel it in my gut that he knows he has this and didn’t tell me. This is just a really sh*tty situation and I’m going to have to speak to him about this, but I have no idea how to approach it now that’s it’s super awkward that he vanished off the face of earth and we hardly know each other…anyways if anyone has any advice on how I should approach this I would really appreciate it because I feel really awkward about how to move forward.",16,2022-03-07 10:52:45-05:00,"Honestly, the whole ghosting thing sounds very suspicious and my take on this is that you're probably right that something fishy is going on. It's also possible that he just used you for sex and is now ghosting (unfortunately it happens). Or maybe he's having symptoms and it's freaked him out, thinking that you passed hsv to him. There's a lot of variables because we don't know what his sexual history is.

My advice would be to be direct but calm and honest. Just reach out to him and tell him you've had worrying symptoms that you've never experienced before. Then tell him you went to get checked out and have been diagnosed with hsv. You can tell him that you've always had a clean bill of health of sti tests in the past and this is the first time you've exhibited symptoms. Then I'd ask if he's noticed any changes in his body recently or anything he's been worried about. If you aren't angry at him about this then I would maybe sign off with saying that you like him and are really enjoying spending time getting to know him and that you want to handle this maturely, that this diagnosis does not change how you feel about him. 

If you go in swinging he's most likely going to back away, especially if he's known about all this. ### Hi- were you actually tested for HSV in your last STD panel? ### I can relate.

I have herpes in my anus (I’m a bisexual male) We didn’t even have sex. He ate my ass, and that’s how I got it.

The guy who gave it to me said he was free of STIs, guess that was a fat lie. I literally just found out an hour ago too and I’m trying to process it all.

You’re not alone x ### Are you absolutely positive that he gave you hsv? Meaning you had a negative herpes test before meeting him? Herpes isn’t on the standard STD panel, you normally have to actually ask for it (the girls at lab Corp asked me if I wanted herpes in my tests and I was shocked they just usually don’t include it). 

The first thing that comes to mind is this… you don’t know who gave you herpes and you will never know if you weren’t tested previously. For all you know, he gave you a different STD that lowered your immune system and triggered your first outbreak. 

Him ghosting you, regardless of the reason, is fucked up. But maybe he thinks you gave it to him and he feels the exact same way you do. Or he was just using you for sex. I’d reach out calmly and maybe ask him to call you or meet up in person. 

Side note: you really seem to be handling your diagnosis well and I’m proud of you ### Wow. You and I literally have the same exact scenarios going on. I could’ve written this myself. The only difference for me is that I ghosted the guy, and not the other way around. That is what was best for my mental health and my sanity. At first I felt obligated to let him now he’s a carrier, but who’s to say he wouldn’t deny it and continue spreading it, or worse start telling people. We’re in a college environment and there’s no way I’m gonna give him ammo to tell other people and slander me. Look out for yourself girl! ### Just rip them a new one and get it out of your system and then try and move on with your life because I've been pissed at mine since I found out and it's not doing any better anymore ### Hey. 22F here. We have some similarities in our stories. Sent you a DM, feel free to respond or ignore. You’re not alone :) and your post is reading like you’re full of shame/embarrassment, and those emotions are something all of us felt at one point but don’t serve you. Wishing u the best on ur journey ### Thank you for this ### Yes I was :( ### If its hsv1 and he had it orally then it's highly likely he wasn't aware he had hsv1. Most people don't realise how its spread. Many people do not even view hsv1 as a sexually transmitted infection, even though oral to genitals hsv1 is common.

So yes, it's possible that guy was lying to you, it's also possible he like so many others (including you and anyone else who is clueless about hsv risk) was totally misinformed about cold sores and how they are spread and potentially even asymptomatic with no reason suspect he had hsv.

Most people use ""sti free"" when referring to the standard sexual health panels, which don't include hsv. Most people aren't aware that hsv isn't included. ### Sending you strength ### Yes :( I was asked if I wanted to be tested when I got my annual and I did. I came back negative for everything. ### same here, guess we all are in somewhat of a similar situation lol. except mine was a completely random guy who SA me when i was drunk :/ 

and i feel you op. i also legit have a gut feeling that the guy who gave this to me knew/knows. also had a gut feeling right before everything went down that he had herpes too. he had no symptoms or anything, i just had such a strong feeling. instead i froze and didn’t listen to my gut. smh ### an ex gave it to me and (apparently) only found out when I got a blood test. he didn’t know he had it prior, but it was enough for him to block me out of embarrassment. I had just ended things, so thought it was more related to that initially but nope, he just didn’t want to have to inform his new partner. it’s very possible and sadly some people are just too immature to discuss the topic, if we weren’t it obviously wouldn’t be stigmatized or spread as often, which we all probably know and keeps us up at night

ETA: I’m talking about GHSV2, but applies to most forms in my opinion ### Yes some people do not want to deal with reality and responsibility. Especially when the relationship is over, it probably just becomes a bad reminder. ### ",8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/t8s8sm/how_do_i_confront_the_person_who_gave_me_hsv/

Looking for facts and advice, just scared I have to walk away from this relationship",1,2022-03-07 21:23:36-05:00,"If your partner is ohsv1 + yes you could get it in either location or both. 

Few problems with your reasoning if walking away. 1- knowing you are actually negative , no OB is common & igg antibody test not that accurate for hsv1 , misses 30 % of positive cases. So you could actually already have it. 

2- This partner has disclosed. A good deal of them don’t. Either because they don’t see the need or have no idea they are positive themselves. 

With up to 70% of us walking around with hsv1 & most of us asymptomatic & not knowing we have it , pretty much impossible to avoid being exposed to it unless you live in a bubble. 

If you truly like the person the hsv1 shouldn’t be the deciding factor as the next & next could  also be positive , as could your previous partners. ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/t965s1/can_i_get_ohsv1_and_ghsv1_at_the_same_time_if_my/

t8lh63,Forgiving someone for giving this to you is literally the hardest thing I’ve ever tried to do… my bf gave me GHSV-1 from his oral HSV-1 that I was unaware about… and he says he didn’t really understand it or know this could happen but that’s so hard for me to believe.. how could he be so careless ? ,245,2022-03-07 04:29:39-05:00,"He didn’t know it’s not his fault A lot of people are uneducated about it and it’s really not that big of a deal my boyfriend gave me HSV-2 and he was unaware that he had it sometimes I do get angry but it’s a part of having sex ### With all due respect, does it truly help you posting in this sub so often? ### Girl this literally just happened to me. Both my partner and I have HSV1 of the mouth. Neither of us really talked about that because we thought nothing of it. When I was diagnosed with GHSV1 that was my and his first time learning you could get genital herpes form oral sex. It was a learning experience for both of us and there was nothing we really could have done to prevent it as we were uneducated. ### Can I ask, you say he didn’t know that it could happen from oral, but if you are educated on it, why didn’t you ask him if he’s ever had cold sores?? If he said yes then you could of stopped it. But you didn’t. You can’t blame him, it takes two to contract herpes and it makes me laugh how people blame who they caught it off but there’s no one out there asking first before they jump in bed with people or there’s very few. Then when they catch it they want to blame the other person who was most probably was just as naive. 

The crazy thing is I really do believe hardly anyones knows cold sores are Herpes and even more so people really don’t realise they can cause genital herpes. Everyone thinks it’s past on through sex only not through oral. People don’t even realise there’s GHSV-1 & GHSV-2.

The sad thing is it’s happened but you’ve got to make piece with it, give your boyfriend a break, I know it’s awful to you but I very much doubt he intended for that to happen. 

Try to put things into perspective, it’s a skin condition not life threatening like cancer or a chronic disease, it’s easily managed and GHSV-1 luckily hardly transmits and has very very few outbreaks. ### Idk. The way you talk about this issue, it seems to me that even if he did get down on his knees and beg for forgiveness, you still won’t fully forgive him for a mistake he had no idea would happen. It seems clear to me that you’re over it. You even mention that GHSV means you’re either stuck with him or you’re alone. That doesn’t sound like someone very committed to
Salvaging the relationship. Forgiveness of another doesn’t mean the other party has to beg for it. You either forgive, forget, or move on. 

You’re chronically going into catastrophe mode. Your life isn’t ruined, stop wrapping yourself up in the stigma. I promise you it will get better but you’ve only been dealing with the diagnosis for a few months. Learning to heal yourself mentally from this isn’t instantaneous but you also need to want to let yourself heal too or else it’s not going to happen. 

As soon as somebody responds to you with a response that doesn’t fit your exact feelings, you stop the replies and move onto the next person who is commiserating with you. Gravitating towards only the negative is doing harm. Look at the glass half full, please. ### I got it sometime during childhood, was always asymptomatic and unknowingly gave it to my ex gf…I’ve never felt so ashamed or guilty in my life. She somehow forgave me and still wants to be friends but I hate to pretend that I didn’t change her life for the worse. This was over a year ago and when it happened I decided that I would always disclose before anything. I’ve just been avoiding dating because I’m not ready to tell a stranger that I could give them one of the most stigmatized STDs that’s also incurable. My fear is that it’ll be weaponized against me; if a girl goes and shares that with her friends, I become the ‘herpes guy’, when in reality being transparent and responsible is a good thing. This is where I understand some of the people who are aware and don’t disclose (which is overall a bad, selfish decision). I’ll always keep it 💯 regardless of the cost but it’s tough. ### Most people have *no idea* you can transmit oral HSV to genitals via oral sex, which is why people never disclose cold sores to sexual partners. I understand that you're angry, but it's not fair to assume that he knew what most people *don't know* about oHSV1. Let's not let our bitterness over getting HSV trick us into assuming the worst about people. ### Unfortunately that’s how a lot of us found out..some people just don’t care to disclose/want to hide it or are uneducated about it. But yeah if he’s willing to hide this from you what else is/will he not tell you. ### I never knew untill I got ghsv, don't which type I have, that someone with ohsv could get ya ghsv...also 80% of people have ohsv...I wouldn't want to go a lifetime without oral sex just to be safe 🥲. Most people don't know they have ohsv or ghsv, I'd let it go. You might have other relationship issues...most people do, but this just happens, not really anyone's fault.

Also it is possible that you have ohsv and dont know or it is actually likely statistically and it is also possibe you could have given him ghsv and he doesn't know. The roles could have easily been reversed and maybe they are? Most people don't know they have ghsv either. It's possible j saying. ### At some point, you have to make a decision to either get over your anger and move on.

And remember that you have a kid with this man, and that kid deserves parents who tried their hardest to stay together, and a mom who got counseling to keep herself together when times got tough. 

My parents were angry at each other my entire childhood. Don't do that to your kid. Go get some counseling. ### honestly everyone gets cold sores its not something people really even think about consciously ### I literally don't blame anyone for this. It is what it is. I'm sure someone who gets frequent breakouts would feel differently but I don't get any and it's not affecting me much. I'm grateful that I took the time to educate myself on it to break myself out of the feeling of impending doom upon finding out I had it. I pray all of you overcome the stigma as well. ### My gf doesn't have it and i have hsv2 and I've had a few disclosures and all went good believe me it's not the end of the world it will get better with time ### Boyfriend gave me hsv 1 through head on week 4 almost of a horrible outbreak but he’s been super supportive and he didn’t know so I’m not mad I was frustrated in the beginning but it’s okay ### So many people are uneducated about herpes, and a lot of people with oral herpes don’t even realize it’s herpes. Honestly, it’s not unbelievable that he didn’t know. So many people with oral herpes don’t know they can transfer it to genitals. Basically, I would say the majority of people, don’t know anything real about herpes. ### This exactly what I’m currently going through. My BF has oral HSV-1 and gave GHSV-1 and 2, which I’m still a little confused about but I totally hear you 😞 ### How do you think half the world feels waking up knowing or just finding out ? Humans are funny beings ### Ohsv1 is basically worse than genital hsv1. You’re fine, you basically have what 60%+ of the population has (oral hsv1). Your boyfriend practically wont get it genitally since he already has it orally & all your future partners as well if they already have it.

Also you’d be surprised how many ppl dont know they can pass “cold sores” to someone’s genitals. ### Forgiveness is not a easy road Forgiveness is not going to make this STD hex go away. ### you want him to feel panic about his cold sores that 80% of population have?
I got hsv from my family when I was a child, and I never felt bad about it. i guess I'm not normal apparently ### My ex boyfriend got ghsv2 from his ex who had ohsv2. Neither of them realized that cold sores were herpes and that they could be passed genitally. I’ve spoken to other people who believed the same thing. I wouldn’t necessarily call him careless for now knowing considering there’s a lot of misinformed people out there. It was hard to cope at first since he had an outbreak but never realized what it was or that he even had herpes but eventually I educated and forgave him. I’m so sorry this happened to you and I hope you can lean to forgive him and this doesn’t wear on you mentally. Its scary at first does get a lot better once you come to terms with it all. ### Maybe he said the truth 🤷‍♀️ 
My ex gave me hsv2 which is terrible but I know 1 million % that he knew what he had and that he was going to pass it to me since he told me that I wasn’t going to be able to wear any type of lingerie but cotton nor tight clothes any longer and he said this in the beginning after we had intercourse for the first time but before I had any OB so I didn’t know what I was going to go through…

Yes some people are careless and even worse than that but some others truest didn’t know. I does he have outbreaks? If he hasn’t then he might be asymptomatic while you aren’t…. ### I think we all want to blame others for our STDs when honestly it's a risk we agree to take every time we have sex. It is tempting to look for a bad guy but the truth is for the most part shit happens and we have to accept it learn from it and move on. Most of us are woefully undereducated on sexual health and won't know simple things like cold sores being herpes. I really am sorry you're going through this but truth is sometimes there is no scapegoat. Shit just happens ### I understand the feeling. I never found out who gave it to me since my symptoms presented themselves after I had been celibate for almost 6 months.

But even then, I was still unbelievably angry and this mystery person. When I read more about HSV, I realized that the vast majority of people who have it don’t even realize they have it. Also, a majority don’t realize that cold sores and genital herpes are caused by the same virus strains (1&2) and that you can transmit the virus oral-to-genital.

This is a fact. It’s a shitty fact that shows the U.S.’ (I only say US because that’s the country I’m in and assume most people in this sub) complete lack quality sex education. So a shitty fact, but a fact nonetheless.

Because of that, I would probably be inclined to believe that your bf is being honest that he didn’t know that he could give it to you genitally.

Now, that doesn’t mean that his irresponsibility didn’t put you at risk and ultimately result in you contracting this virus. And yeah, I’d  be mad as fuck too.

But also, as I’ve said before, I really do think you should try going to therapy or counseling of some sort. When I was first diagnosed, I was so weighed down by feelings of self loathing and shame. Therapy really helped me learn how to feel my feelings truly and wholly, and then allow them to wash over me. ### Just because he is not educated that doesn't excuse it. That's on him and legally he could still be trouble if that was the route you wanted to go. If he knew that he had herpes orally, you could sue him. Accidents do happen, but he should at least feel empathetic about the situation. Im sorry this happened to you. ### Actually, I didn't know how herpes virus actually worked into adult hood. I didn't know that ""cold sores"" are herpes, as a kid always hear just the term cold sores and see the commercials for the over the counter stuff referring to cold sores and making them seem just like something embarrassing ""ugly"" to have but a special chapstick and bam gone. I never understood it fully and this forum taught me so much, even 10 years ago when I got diagnosed with gential herpes the doctor never truly explained the virus either. Simply don't engage in sex when experiencing an outbreak because that's when you're the most contagious. Alot of people are unaware cold sores are in fact herpes, that it's life long and can be passed either orally or onto the gentials. I didn't know till this forum how common ghsv1 is. I think one reason is because talking about sex health is still so taboo and people don't want to look at cold sores as herpes and yeah it's uncomfortable to talk about how you can pass onto someone's gentials because majority of the population contract ohsv1 during childhood  I even saw a tick tock of a nurse explaining all this and the comments were wild people didn't want to accept that their cold sores were the same as cold sores down there are you getting where I'm going with this society as a whole failing us by the lack of proper education no one rly knows about herpes until they get herpes so he may be teling the whole truth to you in all honesty ### *Siiiiiiiigh*.... I got mine from the girl I was with...  we were together for 13 years...both had great jobs...both had great cars...great apartment that felt almost illegal cause it was so amazing to have being young in our 20s... she was sitting in the kitchen one day on a weekend doing something with papers and she had her honey brown hair in a ponytail with her big dorky glasses that i loved when she wore...cause when i kissed her...my nose would always leave a perfect circle on her lens....so there I was sitting on the couch at the time and there I was admiring her beauty just looking at her and thinking of all the shit we got through during all that time together...so I got up and approached her with the topic marriage as a conversation starter.... as a young chap In my mid20's (25-28 lil foggy ) at the time...  I'm like ""why am I talking about marriage"" ...girls should be guaging this with her s/o... but I was head over heels for this angel of a girl who had shaved down horns that were similar to hellboys... and I couldn't figure out why nor did I care... cause she wasn't that person I guess and she tried to change that about herself....when those words about marriage came out of my mouth... she was as if Medusa was having a conversation with her having full eye contact yet she wasnt turning to stone frozen .... the conversation went on and it concluded with what seemed and sounded like cloudy hope... she had a friend whom was her BFF for over 20+ years who was bad influence and ill just leave it at that... when she got news of the conversation she told my ex "" ThAtS a BaLl AnD ChAiN CoMmItMeNt ....YoU DoNt WaNnA bE mArRiEd!!! "" and after that suppository was settled in... it went down hill after that... she'd go out every weekend and party and go bar hopping and come home late... and every other weekend the nights got longer and longer till she'd start coming home the next morning... times I'd wake up to go to work Sunday morning I'd find her in bed fully clothed... and me being the loving bf I thought I was ....I'd try and help unclothed her and say ""babe its me youre home im gonna help take your boots and jacket off ok so you don't suffocate...or whatever cause shed be in bed with everything shed go out in"" she'd fight me off to not help her... like she wanted to keep her clothes on to hide something... at the time I didn't know ...but later on I knew and realized her body was tampered with... and she wasn't the same person .... this went on for months and I tried to ask what happen ? Why the sudden change and always getting SFD(shitfaceddrunk) every weekend... no clear answer... to not try and drag this any further from the inevitable lol... this went on for months and resulted in a very bad break up  ... and she called me one day crying saying she had to talk to me and tell me something... so I met up with her and thats when she told me that those weekends she was out... she hooked up with another person and she had unprotected sex and caught herpes. And if she had it I got it too ... so basically while we together and she gave her body to someone else...she was having unprotected sex with me had a possible breakout aaaand here i am... were not together anymore... its been 7-8 since we've been broken up and I've been single since then... I came to terms and forgave her (she doesn't know).... but in my heart I chose to forgive her. I wasnt innocent ... nor was i perfect either... but id never do that... my heart wouldnt beat true to myself ..I never even got closure about it all... so im dealing with this mystery forever.... but I try to stay above water... just hits me at times that I have this and I can't be the charming,funny, humble man i used to be that everyone loved deeply and respected... being well known in my town.... now people see me as a weird person who's always to him self and quiet..... I don't even have much friends... not many people know my situation cause it wouldn't matter how I got there... they want to label somebody ... I only told maybe 5 close people in my time ... 2 girls wanted to be in a relationship but didnt have the std nd both never happen. And 3 close friends...ill be 35 tomorrow (3.8.1987) and I don't even want to celebrate my birthday at all... I just wanna stay in and just cry.. its been so scary to want to disclose this to anyone.... I live in an area where people always judge or have something to say or will always have shit to talk to a bout a person just to talk .....but its BAAAAD HERE 🤣 like really bad... like people make secret fb groups and put people on blast here and its shame... but whatever I'm ranting.... I still wish her the best in life and I never lied about that and not that I ever ask but as the phrase goes for me (cause when you don't ask anything they tell you everything. and when you ask for everything they don't tell you anything. ) from what im told she has a good busniess going for herself and im happy... so I know what you mean it's tough to forgive someone ... sorry for the rant... damn feelings😒😔 ### How do you know what kind of HSV you have? Please help ### Hah felt this. I was purposely given it by a man who preys on women and has been spreading it since 2017. He was my best friend too until I found out and then all this stuff came out about him like him abusing women physically and emotionally, preying on minors, and drugging women etc. I can never forgive him because he does not deserve to be forgiven and he’s still out there spreading it purposely (not disclosing and lying about it). ### I've been resenting my donor... he knew about it and never occurred that he needs to disclose when drunk. He's had HSV2 for 7 yrs 🙄  He said he wants an authentic friendship - mind you I was distancing myself from him for a couple months.. I don't hate him but I can't forgive him either. I tried to be close to him but that didn't work. Told him I kinda miss him yesterday (since he gave me a wine bottle to remember him lol) and I finally told him how I felt. Not sure why he doesn't understand this was mentally difficult for me to deal with, but here we are... I had to be honest about how I felt. ### I completely understand why you’re freaking out as this just happened and a lot of us have not been properly educated on it. I just wanted to add tho this is a group that is mostly probably people who have it or are just getting educated. Your comments kinda make it sound like people with HSV are freaks, a very much “othering” perspective. This is the perspective that makes people feel so ashamed tbh. I’m not at all trying to sound mean and I apologize if I do I just wanted to say. I do hope that you’re able to find peace and comfort I completely understand how scary it can be to worry. I am about to get tested to find out but I genuinely feel I got it at birth from my mother. ### Did he have a cold sore at the time? ### The only way you can absolutely not have an std is to not have sex. That's it.

Even sex with condoms is not 100% guaranteed. ### > it’s really not that big of a deal

For some people. Please don’t be so dismissive, the severity varies for everyone ### It’s a huge deal though… and I want to not be mad at him and let it go but I think it’s been harder because he doesn’t see it as anything. ### I didn’t understand the last phrase what do you mean by:’sometimes I do get angry but it’s a part of having sex’? ### I think OP might need more individualized support than this sub can give them ### Who knows. ### You may of caught hsv-1 orally & genitally at the same time & just didn’t realize it..super rare to get it after already having. Unless your partner had an open sore & you have quite a poor immune system. Was it properly diagnosed and swabbed as HSV-1? ### Wow you both had oral hsv1 and managed to spread it to the genitals? ### I’m sorry 😞 I thought I knew but I didn’t know enough ### This ^ 

My ex gf has oral hsv1, very severe obs... after a few dates she mentioned she got cold sores ""when the weather changes"". Embolden by the fact I'd finally met someone who was open about talking about herpes, I disclosed to her that I had it genitally. I felt relieved and confident that I'd finally found myself in that mythical ""oh I have it too!"" situation. In reality, she had absolutely no idea cold sores were caused by the herpes virus. She had no idea it was contagious. She had no idea she could spread it when a cold sore was present and she had no idea she could spread it through oral sex even with no cold sore present. Wasn't even aware of antivirals. She was completely clueless and, until I educated her about it, lived in complete blissful ignorance.

Point being, people with oral hsv1 are often times not told by a doctor (they just have it since a kid), are poorly educated about hsv or are straight up lied to/misled by those around them as to what cold sores are and how they are transmitted.

As you say, the hypocrisy I see from people blaming their partners for contracting hsv when they themselves are just as woefully misinformed is staggering. It's so easy to jump into this mindset of ""HOW DARE THEY! THEY KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DOING"", and whilst that's true for some people who willfully and knowingly lie about disclosure, given that 70% of people don't even know they have hsv, the fact is the vast majority are just totally unaware. 

If you cannot accept the risk of STIs or if you cannot discuss the intricacies of STIs (and your current testing status) when you find partners, then you shouldn't be having sex. ### And what am I supposed to do if it doesn’t work out? He isn’t gonna tell anyone he has OHSV and he can go do whatever and just not do oral sex and I’m stuck with the baggage.. he doesn’t think it’s a big deal at all and it’s a huge deal. ### Disclosing that you have any std/sti is on the person who has it. ### You sound like a decent and respectful person. A good guy!

Just wanted to ask; do you think that by not putting yourself out there you are perpetuating the stigma you have called out?

If it helps any, I also took a break from dating for a long time - getting back into dating and getting over my fear of rejection has been very empowering for me. I've also never been rejected for having hsv. I have the same concerns as you about it being weaponized, which is why I don't disclose to my friends and I generally follow that cliché of ""don't sh*t where you eat"" - I tend to seek out relationships with girls who aren't part of my immediate circle of friends to get around that. 

I also ""vet"" the girls I date, spending time getting to know them before sex and working out if I think they can handle disclosure. Are they kind? Are they mature? Are they judgemental? If I have concerns about those answers, I don't pursue the relationship. It's made me approach dating in a different way and I've actually developed much closer bonds with them as a result. When I disclose I do it via text and always finish the text with a line about how I really value my privacy and to please keep this disclosure between us. ### He says it never came up and he didn’t think anything of it. He thought it was different then Genital hsv and didn’t know it could transmit… he also barely ever has OBS because he got it as a child so he’s had a long time for his body to build up to it. ### I’m trying it’s just hard. ### They really should though… ### Yes! Education is 100% power when it comes to this. I was visually diagnosed on Tue 3/1 and was devastated and thought this was a complete and total nightmare. I stayed up all night that night reading forums, watching youtube vids, listening to podcasts and after learning everything that I learned I am so much more confident and understanding of the situation. It's a deal, but it's not a huge deal. It sucks but it could definitely be a million times worst. Life isn't over, sex isn't over.. you just gotta be more aware of what's happening, disclose it and if that person doesn't accept you they aren't worth the time and don't need to be in your life. Great reply! ### My first OB lasted a really long time too. My bf was supportive for like a week and then it was like ok time to move on with everything. ### No but forgiveness will save my relationship.. so that I can actually have one. ### No I want him to acknowledge he has HSV and that it can be transferred to other people. ### He gets cold sores it’s just been a long time since he got one and he says he thought they were different then Genital and couldn’t be passed like that. ### Ehhh my ex cheated and got it, I totally blame him. ### Thank you 😒 and I’ve heard of people trying to do that and it never works out well plus I don’t wanna be alone anyway. So I’m just gonna have to deal. ### Blood test. ### Oh no that’s awful…. 😞 I could never do this to anyone. ### Wow that’s completely different and terrible. ### Idk 😞 ### I got it without having sex. ### Well he definitely should show compassion and understand that it is a virus but you have HSV one down there  usually you don’t have that many breakouts and the symptoms aren’t as bad as HSV-2 you got lucky girl it could b way worse ### I mean by getting angry when I’m having a severe outbreak and it hurts to P I get angry at him for not knowing and herpes is a part of having sex if you have sex you could possibly get herpes is a part of having sex that’s what I mean ### I’ve had cold sores in my mouth as long as I can remember. We believe he performed oral while he had a cold sore and that’s how I got it. I was properly swabbed and diagnosed by an ob/gyn who told me I likely got it from oral. I am awaiting blood results that will tell me if this is a new or old infection. ### Yes. Didn’t know that was possible but it happened. I think he has it on his genitals too now though there’s no official testing for him as of now. ### It’s ok. There should be more education on this in schools but there isn’t. I wouldn’t be mad at your boyfriend for this, as he was likely uneducated as well. ### Well put, that’s one of the best responses I’ve seen on here. ### If I knew all I know now about HSV I wouldn’t have had sex. ### Best response out there.. 100%! Love this! ### Why are you doom mongering about it not working out with your partner?? You've just said your partner is accepting of your diagnosis. And why are you concerning yourself with whether your partner goes on to disclose or not? What bearing does that have on you and your future life? Hsv1 genitally is not easily spread to the genitals - Terri Warren has not seen PIV spread hsv1 in 35+ years. Terri Warren has also said that whilst the initial months can be tough, genital hsv1 outbreaks for MOST people tend to improve over time. You basically have the least worst strain in the least worst place for it, meaning your likelihood of transmitting through sex is very, very, very low. Perspective is important here.

Also ""he can go do whatever and just not do oral sex"" - you realise for some people oral sex is a massive part, if not the highlight of their sex lives? There's no ""just"" about it. You are both in the same situation, but because your bf has better coping strategies than you, you think he is somehow impervious to the realities of hsv and that you are the only victim in this situation. ### Like I said earlier people don’t know that oral herpes can be spread to the genitals, some people don’t even know they have it. They’re asymptomatic all their lives then pass it on via oral sex completely unaware that they’ve passed it. 

If someone is uneducated in the fact they can pass it on orally then someone is also uneducated in receiving oral from someone who may have, to me that’s equal. Both parties are unaware of the implications. But the unaware person who passes is to blame, how is that honestly fair??

So saying disclosing is on the the person who has it, bit tricky if they don’t know or at best they don’t know what it causes, which I believe is the majority of people with OHSV-1.

People don’t get educated on it all until they catch it or unless they work in a related medical field.

Reading your comments further down telling OP to sue him etc is insane, OP has posted so many times on here, shes been spiralling for a week or so, last thing she needs is you filling her head with destructive thoughts, they could have a kid etc. You really need to be careful going around saying things like this, it’s so negative and to be honest all you’re doing is adding and fuelling the already way way over the top stigma attached to herpes. ### All I am saying is that if you know that you have herpes. You have had an active cold sore. If you have never had an active cold sore and still have herpes that is a different scenario. You as the individual has a responsibility to educate yourself about it. Being ignorant or unaware to something does not make it not your fault.

For example, if you pass a sign on the road saying the speed limit is 50 mph, but you just ignore that sign or failure to learn that the road sign means don't go above 50 mph or you could get a ticket, and you get a ticket its still your fault. Not knowing how to read the sign/ignoring the sign doesn't make you not guilty of speeding. ### Exactly so he should have told me… ### Is OHSV an STI? First I knew about it. ### Hey! Thanks for sharing your experience with hsv and dating, I’m still trying to get over that fear. That’s a great question. While I do think that not dating reduces the amount of people who are disclosing, I also think that it’s important to take the time to (mentally) heal from my diagnosis. The ‘vetting’ you mentioned is a smart idea! And yeah, there’s no way I’m disclosing to a girl if we have mutual friends. ### The stigma does suck but it’s just a skin condition. Easily treatable and lots of people have it. Some people have one outbreak and that’s it. Try daily suppression. There’s even dating sites for people with the same condition. ### You’ve stated on here you’re educated on it, so how come you didn’t ask him? ### It'll take a little time to come to terms with it, but it's not a big deal 😊. Your reaction is probably based on stigma that's been ingrained in you, but as others have said it's very common and it's just part of sex and being human. ### why? ### I’m sorry that’s really upsetting some people can’t handle the strain it puts on a relationship is it worth it to stay with him? And have you expressed how you feel to him? ### I thought that as well, I never knew that herpes could be genital honestly nor I knew that there are 8 types of herpes, 2 of which are caused by herpes simplex. In Italy a huge amount of people has herpes/ cold sores on the mouth lip and they don’t do dramas about it at all it’s like having a pimple or similar not a big deal but as I read a lot on internet I found out that in the US it’s heavily stigmatised like if someone has something that only bad people have… so it’s seen really badly and shameful..
I feel terrible since I got this hsv2 but this is probably because of the many painful outbreaks who put me in a low state of mind and physical discomfort like having a flu and all of this symptoms didput me into a panic mode for very long. I’m so upset with myself because I was truly ignorant about herpes… ### Oh yeah that's totally understandable ### Yeah, I would recommend against doing it for financial reasons if that was the only thing. ### Yeah no normal human being with a conscience can haha. Sadly all the police reports against him have gone no where either :/ ### Sorry this happened to you. But I'm only making a generalized statement here, not trying to be statiscally pure. Thanks. ### Was it oral? ### How? ### It could be worse just dismisses OP’s feelings altogether. It’s not nothing and it’s a lifelong illness. ### I definitely just feel invalidated because he just says if you really just wanna be with me forever like we talked about.. then why does it matter you already have a husband that loves you.. you have a family.. but life happens so idk what the future holds and it could be worse but Hsv is Hsv. ### If you’ve had cold sores for as long as you can remember(HSV1), how would your blood test from your most recent visit after the genital breakouts tell you if said breakouts are the result of a new or old infection? ### Yeah sounds about right. Would have to be with sores present. ### Wow that’s crazy! How old are you guys? ### I’m upset with him for his actions after my diagnosis more then anything but I hate myself for letting this happen. ### Yes and that is what I think is the main point - you seem to be blaming your partner for this, and saying that he either did know or should have known about transmission risk of hsv1, just because he had it, yet at the same time do not extend that same expectation to yourself. I'm trying to explain that your experience  is exceptionally common and the responsibility for you having hsv is not all his. ### You would never have sex again if you knew about herpes? The majority of the adult population has herpes. It’s just the risk of sex. ### I think he still doesn’t believe how contagious it is and he won’t get any facts or research it.. he just doesn’t care about it at all.. and that bothers me and I seen that but then I’ve had people write me and tell me they got ghsv-1 from ghsv-1… ### Both genital and oral herpes are considered stds. I understand that it is a skin condition,  ut because it can be transferred sexually it is a std. Check out https://www.emedicinehealth.com/is_herpes_really_an_std/article_em.htm#:~:text=by%20HSV%2D1.-,Both%20genital%20herpes%20and%20oral%20herpes%20are%20considered%20STDs%20(sexually,%2C%20oral%2C%20or%20anal%20sex. ### That’s so unfair though I’d have to go on a website just to try to find someone.. also how do I know if he gave me OHSV? As well I only had an OB for Genital… but now I’m wondering. ### I’ve never seen one to ask. I knew cold sores are HSV but I didn’t know they could be passed even without a sore present… I knew people are supposed to tell you if they get them though ### It’s a part of how my body is handling it the most… ### Because they’re transferring it to other people… ### I’m an idiot myself I knew cold sores are herpes but I thought that was being educated enough I didn’t know that don’t test for it and I didn’t know it could be passed when a sore isn’t present etc. ### Yeah no.. it benefits me more to have him helping paying the bills at our home. ### That would be sex. So no. ### I have hsv2, I have no trouble getting sexual partners. I have a well written, well researched disclosure I send people, that reveals my status and educates. It’s very effective. You’re not doomed because you have herpes. ### Just a quick question. Did you have forever in mind with your partner? Doesn't sound as if you did. It sounds like your partner was simply filling a space until you could do better. Ijs. ### Idk but my doctor knows I have cold sores. I’ll ask her that once the results come back because you bring up a good point. ### I got GHSV1 and I have no idea how. Is it possible they didn’t have any sores and still transmitted it? ### 23 and 24 ### What were his actions that upset you? ### No I blame myself as well I told him that I’m a complete idiot and ruined my own life as well…but I would like him to take some accountability in it as well.. ### Yes I 110% would have never again. ### Like many things on the Internet I would take it with a pinch of salt about them getting ghsv1 from ghsv1. If there was any oral foreplay at all before or after sex, it's way more likely that that's where they acquired hsv1. Whereas the research by Terri Warren is much more reliable.

It's frustrating when we aren't on the same page but you need to understand that some people just don't give a damn about hsv; its just another opinion. He has it, he can't get rid of it, he wants to stay with you and be with you not bang other people. The healthiest mindset in that position is to give as little thought to hsv as possible. You're at no risk to each other.

Sorry for being insensitive but some of your responses read like you don't really want to be with this guy. On the one hand you're both positive now, there's absolutely zero risk of either of you catching hsv again now from each other. You can go back to having unprotected sex, which is arguably much more enjoyable, especially once your initial symptoms have cleared up. But then on the other hand you seem fixated and angry about the possibility that your partner is going to find someone else, sleep with who he wants without disclosing or being rejected. If you want to be with your partner, why are you even thinking like this? It doesn't make any sense. 

In a weird way, this hsv diagnosis could be used as an opportunity to bond with eachother, the fact you both have it and have been resilient enough to handle diagnosis together without breaking up and without awkwardness. But its all about perspective and ultimately how you want to channel this event. We cannot control what happens to us in life but we do have control over how we respond to situations. ### That fact is true yes it can be passed from mouth to genital but the general consensus across the board it is definitely not considered to be an STD, if you honestly believe that you’re deluded. Kids contract it from family who kiss them, there’s so many ways it’s transmitted. Saying oral herpes is an STD is just simply not true. But if you caught OHSV-1 or 2 from someone’s genitals then yes I suppose that’s an STD. But oral to oral it isn’t. ### I have had numerous success dating on regular dating apps and disclosing to allegedly negative men (I say allegedly because they don’t test for herpes on STD screens and it’s estimated 70% of herpes carriers will never have an outbreak). It’s not a deal breaker for most people, especially once you educate them about it. It’s not the boogeyman people think it is. ### Unless you tested beforebdating him, you really couldn't tell unless you did an igm test and igm test which igg came negative.

As far as the herpes singles dating think, don't worry about that, things will be different and kinda harder but the above person is right most be don't have an OB and it's just a skin condition like acne, the most daunting thing everyone agree om is rejection = stigma, and not actually having it.

You will have some downs and ups and realize some people know what is is, and some don't and will either ask for more information or remain ignorant. Remember you don't need to feel if someone accepts you for casual fun or dating that it is a reason to over look red flags, be the same person you have been before your diagnosis of not better. You aren't your diagnosis, it's just apart of your life
 
If you want message me and I can give you some tips on disclosure. ### So you were just as uneducated in the end. And unfortunately a lot of people are not only like your BF , who actually had cold sores , a lot of us have never had an OB and discovered 50 yrs later we are positive.  No one ever mentioned asymptomatic hsv carriers to us in school nor viral shedding.  Dr still tell people they don’t have to disclose with ohsv1. 

Not saying he shouldn’t have mentioned it but I think we all need to ask potential partners their sti status. Both parties responsibility ### But you’ve just said it, you didn’t know they could be passed on if no sores are present, surely it’s the same thought your boyfriend had too. If he didn’t know and neither did you it’s no one’s fault is it. Just one of those things. I honestly feel for you both, it’s definitely no one’s fault, blame won’t help anything other than destroy your relationship. Is that what you want? ### So you didn't know herpes can be passed on with or without an outbreak present but you expected him to know? I'm reading he says he got cold sores as a child so he probably never thought anything of it because when we catch ohsv1 in childhood no one typically tells that child hey when you grow up make sure you disclose to all potential partners because even without a cold sore present you can pass it onto them orally and gentially so be aware this condition is life long, so yeah many people just have no idea and specifically about being able to give someone ghsv1 he's probably being honest with you about what he knew and didn't know ### I c, my symptoms are mild and I'm on valtrex, so now I never have symptoms. I also live a pretty healthy lifestyle...your body will adjust don't worry. ### The only time I really see people come out ahead for it is if they are already suing/taking to court for something else. ### You got genital herpes not from sex? How? So curious. ### Hi could I please use your disclosure script? :) ### Would love to read this as well ### May I also piggyback on the script request? You’re amazing and also absolutely right! ### How old are you? And are you in the us? ### Oooh could I have it to?? ### Could you share with me as well? Thanks! ### I would absolutely love to see this disclosure as well if you wouldn’t mind. 😁 ### Can you Dm me that disclosure please? ### I didn’t have forever in my mind but I wasn’t thinking of anyone else either I just wanted to be normal and have a normal relationship. ### Absolutely possible because I got it from someone who hasn’t had a cold sore since he was a child. ### Do you know if they had sores or not? ### Idk If I’m just hyper aware but it seems like hella young people are being diagnosed with ghsv1 ### Not taking it seriously just expecting me to just get up and move on with life and get over it ### Your life isn’t ruined, you just found out, so you’re freaking out, totally normal. But your life isn’t ruined, your sex life isn’t ruined. Educate yourself as much as possible on it. My attitude is that in general, it’s nothing but an overblown skin condition. I tell my partners about it, but basically, if your sexually active, you risk herpes. It’s just the way it is. ### Yeah.. idk I feel trapped now that he gave this to me and in a weird way I think he’s happy about it.. and I’m not I feel like it took away my freedom and took away my ability to speak on things like now he can do whatever because I’m in fear of being alone with hsv… and I think he’s gonna use that against me ### I am in no way saying that most people get herpes through sex, but because you can transfer herpes sexually that makes it an std. Its a technicality and in no way the point. It's just like you can get gonorrhea and other stds of the mouth and if you kiss some, share a straw with them, etc. you can pass it. That doesn't make it not an std/sti. ### If we don’t workout I would honestly just stay single.. but I know he wouldn’t. ### Yeah we should I just didn’t know everything about them I didn’t know people could go years without them. But I’ve already said that I take accountability as well I’m an idiot for letting this happen to myself as well ### He had something on his lip it just didn’t look like a cold sore but he was healing from an actual busted lip and I asked about it.. he said it was just a busted lip…i don’t understand how someone can grow up getting cold sores and no one ever told them or they never once looked it up to see… I don’t think it was intentionally done but it was careless and neglectful to put me at risk. ### And I feel like this already has destroyed my relationship and my life for the most part.. and there is nothing I can do about it.. it literally never goes away. ### I just got out the hospital from a bad reaction to valtrex. ### Still trying to figure that one out. Got my first cold sore last week and I thought it was a pimple at first, so that could've been it (trying to pop it or scratch it with my hand maybe). Or I share a bathroom in a house with 2 others, and someone could've used a body scrubber or towel without me knowing. The cold sore mightve come from sharing drinks. I have no idea really. I havent been sexual or even flirty since Nov 2019. ### Of course!! I’ll DM you!! ### Indeed!! ### But of course!! ### Canada, 35 ### Totally!! I’ve wanted to post it on r/herpes, but I just have this feeling that people will pick it and me apart over it, and it just sounds like a hassle I don’t want lol. I’ll DM you!! ### Absolutely!! ### Yes indeed!! ### On it!! ### But you are normal. Your relationship is normal. HSV1 is a teeny tiny blip on the radar of life. ### It’s just so confusing. The last person I received oral from has tested negative but said he used to get cold sores! ### I didn’t see any on their mouth, I’m pretty sure I would have noticed ### If you have oral sex you can get hsv1G, age really has nothing to do with it. ### Well that shows inconsideration on his part. I would recommend telling him that’s unacceptable, but you’re not his mother and he shouldn’t be like that to begin with. ### omggg im gonna post a little bit of my text convo with my bf after I found out he gave me ghsv1 cause he also didn’t acknowledge the severity of what i was dealing with and it made me so mad. me: “… ya so u gave me hsv1”
him: “you said it was genital”
me: “yeah you can get it on your genitals”
him: “ This whole time i thought you were talking about (type) 2. like 90% of people have type 1”
me: “ it’s closer to 75%”
him: “I apologize but now it’s not that big of an issue” LIKE WTF. made me so mad ### If I would have been told that I would have stayed celibate. ### I'm so sorry you feel like this. As an outsider looking in the answer is pretty obvious. I would not continue a relationship where I felt the way you say you are feeling. You shouldn't be with someone because you think you'll be rejected elsewhere, especially if you think this is going to lead to an imbalance in the power dynamic of your relationship. Obviously I have no idea about the details of your relationship but it reads like this guy doesn't treat you very well. ### You might feel that way now, but it really is no big deal. I’ve had 10+ partners since - I had one sorta rejection and then once I educated him on it he was fine with it… but then he wanted to use no condom and I said hell no buddy and he backed out haha. As far as STDs go, herpes is of the least concern. The “curable” STDs are the ones that’ll damage your organs. ### I definitely think you should give yourself time to grieve and be angry about this. I got this from my mother as a baby and I still give myself time to grieve and be angry about having it when I have an outbreak. I was so careful with my daughters and gave it both to them. I don’t feel guilty but I’m still sorry I did. I’m also really happy to read about these positive experiences with full disclosure! ### You are definitely not an idiot. Honestly even if you take just about every precaution you could still get it. The info on it is poor & conflicting. ### So you need to get out of this relationship and set your partner free if you know deep in your heart you will never forgive him. I mean what’s the point in complaining constantly. Just move on. ### You and your boyfriend both have HSV-1 you can’t give it to eachother. Why has it destroyed your relationship? 

If I was was you I’d try to put everything that’s bothering you into perspective. Talk to your boyfriend too.

Take on each issue one by one and get things sorted. Don’t give up try and be positive, your life really isn’t over no where close. 

You got a boyfriend who has HSV, you have the weakest form of HSV. So make the best of it.

There’s a lot of people on here in a way harder situation. Some people don’t have a partner, some people have both GHSV-1 & 2, so you got to try to put things into perspective. ### Just give it time and your doctor will work with you and you should be able to get it under control 😊. Try thinking positive, sorry that's annoying to hear. It's going to take a little time. ### Oh, I thought you meant you got genital herpes not through sex. You can totally get oral herpes from sharing drinks and stuff with people. Pretty common for people to get it as kids from relatives. ### Could have inherited. It can be passed down.

Edit: Birth-acquired herpes. ### Me too please! ### Care to also DM me that? I literally just tested positive today for HSV2. Granted the blood work number was low, especially compared to HSV1 (I get cold sores so I already knew that) and I’ve never had an outbreak in my genital region. ### Nice thank you! ### Can you send it to me too please, I’ve basically just been celibate for 6 years over my fear of telling anyone and i just cant handle it anymore. I need all the help i can get making disclosing easier. ### can u send me it too pls! ### When did you get it? ### I would also love it if u could DM me it :) ### Y ### Could you send to me as well?! ### can u send me it too pls!! ### It doesn’t feel like it at all. ### Well, it’s really one of two things, then—either what he got weren’t really cold sores, or he got a false negative on that test! ### The sores can be on the inside of the mouth and you wouldn’t necessarily see them. ### I’m very well aware any and everybody can get ghvs1 from oral sex and that age doesn’t have anything to do with it. I simply made an observation that I’ve seen A LOT of people within the ages of 18-25 get diagnosed with ghsv1. ### research says younger people in this timeframe getting genital hsv1 is not uncommon. My OBGYN also said she’s seen “ a lottttt “ of new cases of ghsv1 among young people, and that it’s going to be something “our generation is just going to have to deal with” ### Well hopefully you’re opinion of things will change over time, for the good of your mental health. I barely give a thought to herpes on the regular. Just comes up when I disclose to new partners, but overall has pretty much no effect on my life. ### He treated me very well before this happened and now I feel like we’re both being two completely different people.. he ruined the person I was and I’m not sure if he’s just being the way he is from everything or if he’s showing his true colors. ### You’ve got way more confidence then me that’s for sure and I would still rather have gotten something curable 10 times then this once ### It sucks that I have to be looked down on my whole life now because I didn’t know… and I’ve been with my bf a while ### I told him I needed time apart when this first happened and he refuses to leave/leave me because he’s worried about me and my mental state and said he doesn’t want anyone else and doesn’t want to be away from his family. ### Ever since it happened I’ve fell into a deep depression I’m built up of anger resentment and self hate… I’m not myself anymore I used to be the caretaker and do everything I worked all the time cooked cleaned etc and now I don’t have that in me anymore to do anything I barely work I don’t cook I don’t clean I just want to lay in bed and sleep that’s it.. I’ve went to the doctor to get on meds to see if they help and they haven’t done much yet.. we constantly argue because he’s not used to me being like this and he doesn’t understand why it’s such a big deal to me he also isn’t good at being the caretaker and being on the other side I’ve realized…things are really tough but I know it’s gonna be even tougher for me now if things don’t work out I’ll be a single mom with Genital Herpes now and that isn’t gonna be easy.. he says he doesn’t see me any different but he doesn’t acknowledge I see myself different ### It’s not annoying to hear just struggling. ### It mightve spread though. So I was pretty worried. I'm at Planned parenthood and the lady that saw the bumps said she wasnt worried about it just now. (Still paranoid af tho) ### Herpes is not genetic. ### Yeppers!!! ### No problem! ### Absolutely!!! ### Yes indeed!!! ### I’ve had it for 3 years. Was in a relationship at the time. Could’ve been from him(would’ve been asymptomatic if he had it), or I could’ve had it in my system for years and it came out because I was incredibly run down at the time. Doesn’t really matter where I got it. I knew a decent amount about herpes already when I got it. I knew how common it was. ### Coming in hot!! ### Indeedly dee!! ### What would make you feel better about all of this? What can we redditors say to make you feel better? ### So frustrating since they don’t test for it in routine STI screening! ### He’s a pretty open and honest guy, so I feel like he would have said something. Or he’s just ignorant and didn’t know what they actually were ### Yep, pretty much! ### \^\^ This!!   
My little sister's friend has had herpes for since middle school (15+ years) and has a completely normal sex life with her boyfriend of 3-4 years. He gets tested once maybe twice a year and is still negative for herpes. They have unprotected sex all the time, she takes her daily viral suppressant medication and if she starts to ever feel any tingles she tells him immediately just so he knows and is aware. She told her that she doesn't even think about having herpes anymore and in fact hasn't had a full blown OB in over 6 years. She takes the daily suppressant, L-Lysine and Zinc to help with her immune system daily, eats somewhat healthier and works out 2-3 times a week. So many people live their daily lives with this virus. It's not the end of the world, just a little hump in the road that you gotta get past once and awhile. ### I do not think your boyfriend has ruined the person you were. You are not tainted or any less of the person you were before diagnosis. It's not healthy to keep blaming him entirely for all this and it's not accurate either ### Do you want to be infertile? Cos the curable ones cause infertility (I mean I’m childfree so I’d honestly be okay with that part, but I don’t actually want organ damage).

Give it time. You’ll be fine. The first disclosure was the hardest. I’m 50/50 text vs in person and text is easier. Honestly I actually prefer telling people before we even meet.

But also if you love your boyfriend maybe try to get through this funk and make it work. I imagine he’s struggling with the fact he gave this to you. My now ex boyfriend who I was with at the time slut shamed me and blamed me for giving it to him, even though he most likely gave it to me if he has it (he “noticed a bump” after my diagnosis but never got it checked out; I’m willing to bet he had that bump before my outbreak considering it sounded very mild where as I had an outbreak from hell which is typical with initial OBs) ### Lots if people have it . And they go into find partners , have kids etc. Same as everyone else.  Hsv1 70% of population has it. ### If you really wanted him to stop coming around you would put your foot down and close that door. No one wants to be stuck in a relationship that they don’t want to be in. You need to get some counseling as well. Its eighther your gonna live with it or your gonna die with it. You gotta make up your mind. ### I think you definitely need to try and take steps to make piece with it. If you can’t I think you definitely should get help from a therapist. ### Is it the actual virus causing you to feel like this? The physical symptoms of it causing fatigue and so on? Or is it the idea that you have it that makes you so depresssed? If the latter, sweetheart please work on accepting this, see it for what it is, a virus causing rash and potentially a few other physical symptoms, you may or may not have frequent outbreaks, there are meds to reduce them if you do. You're creating a dark spiral that is hard to get out of here. Truly the stigma, physical location and not enough education is painting a picture that is darker than reality. You can live with this, you're not doomed. Much love X 
(Also, many in this subreddit is in this dark spiral with you it seems, so it might not be the best to spend lots of time on here reading about other people's personal discouragement when you feel that bad yourself.) ### Just takes time like anything. This should t have to be a significant aspect of your life. I do t read around on thia forum, because some people like to make it a big deal, when it's not. Everything is about your attitude towards it. Some people live with lost limbs, paralysis, no food or money etc etc. You will be fine 😊 good luck and be patient with your emotions and the symptoms ### It’s very uncommon to get an hsv1 genital infection, when you already have the hsv1 infection orally. Obviously don’t touch a cold sore than touch your genitals. But it’s rare, because you’re already infected with it. You can get hsv2 genital still though. Anyways, I have hsv2 genital, it’s not a big deal. ### But a mother who has it can give it especial if having an active outbreak but even when not since most babies come out the coochie is what I’m guessing they meant. also im sure other ways. I googled a little on it so it’s totally possible to have at birth ### Thank you so much ### Could I have the script too? ### Idk… I really don’t. ### Everything you are saying her!! Absolutely!! It’s not the end of the world. Not even close to it. Herpes isn’t fucking up my sex life, covid is! ### I don’t act or feel the same I used to about myself and I blame us both more myself then him but I do have anger built up towards him. ### I’ve already got a kid and now that I have HSV I refuse to have anymore I would rather not be able to have kids then have this virus though.. I would literally rather almost anything… tbh. And wow that’s shitty yeah I’ve been trying to let it go but it’s been crazy hard. ### I have some set up this week and all of that is easier said then done. ### I see one this week but therapy isn’t gonna take this away. ### Probably the fact I have it and it never goes away :/  and it really is hard to get out of I feel trapped. ### Yeah. But since this was my first infection, and I was uneducated/ didnt know what it was af first, I could be that rare case. I've felt some tingles, and there were 2 spots that were worrying me on my scrotum, one red one that went away in a few hours, and a white one that looked like a slightly larger sized whitehead. I also just learned they dont test for hsv 1 my planned parenthood because ""it is so common"". So I got tested for hsv2 which Im pretty sure I dont have. I dont know what to do. ### Why do you say that it’s not a big deal? To be honest I’m happy to read your comment but I’m curious to know why do you say this. ### Yes, a baby can get it during birth, but if that happens, the baby is very, very sick, and it is a systemic (full body) illness. It doesn't appear as genital herpes years later. ### Yessiry!! ### Ok, here's a reddit hug from me to you. I hope to see you in a much better place soon. ### You’ll be okey just accept it hardly to say but I caught it same way like you I regret the past but now is present and cant do shit ### You’re still in shock. That’s normal. This virus is so minimal in the grand scheme of things. And I’m glad I have genital herpes as opposed to oral because at least when I get an outbreak it’s not advertised on my face ### Your preaching to the choir hun. Time heals all wounds. Couldn’t it just be that he was misinformed about the virus and its transmission? ### Hey, you’re grieving a negative status and anger is a step to acceptance. Maybe you and your bf can hit a couples counselor to talk everything through and help him see that this is a massively big deal for you. If you can’t forgive him, don’t stay with him just bc you’re afraid to be single with herpes. That’s how I let myself get trapped in a severely abusive relationship for seven months. If there was a cure for herpes, I wouldn’t have given that asshole seven days of my life. You will make the right choice. Don’t bury your anger, it will fester until it pops up in really inopportune moments. Good luck 💕 ### Well I hope you find some peace with it. It truly isn't the end of world. I'd say get off reddit, let some time pass to see how your journey with it will be. Most people find their OBs get less frequent with time. Take supplements to support your immune system. It sounds like you and your mind are making you way more ill than this virus ever will. Fuck the people who clueless and potentially make you feel bad about this. You'll be fine. As for depression, it's temporary, how you feel right now is not how you'll feel for the rest of your life. Lastly and again, get off reddit - live your life, do things you enjoy and take care of yourself. ### You’ll be fine. Like they said hsv1 oral is extremely common. It’s everywhere. 3.7 billion people 0-49 have it. Hsv2 genital isn’t as common, but it’s still very common. 13-20% of people 15-49 have it. 1/5-1/6 in Canada, US, Europe have it. More common in women than men as the way our genitals are, makes it easier for us to catch. ### Because for most people it isn’t. 80/90% of people with herpes are asymptomatic or have symptoms so mild they never notice. Out of people who are symptomatic, it’s a small percentage that actually have a hard time with it as in frequent bad outbreaks(I’m on valtrex daily because my body had trouble suppressing it). But it doesn’t do anything to your health. All it is is a skin condition. It’s not like other STIs where it has negative health effects. The other thing is, the majority of the adult population has a form of herpes. Just most don’t know they have it. It is super enmeshed in the population. So really it’s not a big deal. For a lot of people, the problem they have with it is the stigma. It’s the stigma that sucks. If there wasn’t that, having it would be so much easier for the majority of people who know they have it. ### But a baby can contract it during birth via genital herpes and not just from systemic herpes. Some mothers get their first outbreak at Birth and therefore did not take measures to keep from passing via birth canal or maybe even viral shedding especially moms who didn’t disclose to doctors they had it. If a baby is not aC section then any part of their body that touches any part of the birth canal or any where there is viral shedding has the chance to contract it to any part of their body. You’re right it definitely can cause really bad problems for children. At least from what I read that is a higher chance with systemic herpes. ### Thank you. ### I still don’t know if he gave me oral too or not yet tbh. ### Idk..that’s the thing but if I got sores around my mouth from a child to an adult I would have looked more into it.. ### He probably did ask a doctor and the doc brushed off as cold sores. Thats what docs tell you. Your talking about yourself. You don’t know what another person would do. We all know that hsv 1 is brushed off as cold sores. Im just finding out since I joined this reddit that it’s actually hsv1 and can be transferred to the genitals. ### I was very sad at first… and still kind of am but alot of my sadness has turned into anger… and I’ve been debating that ### Like I said, it’s the stages of grief. I was stuck on the bargaining stage forever. Constantly checking the herpes cure research page for news and donating money I didn’t have to progress a science I know nothing about. I think I’m moving closer to true acceptance every day tho. I want the same for you, but I know it’s hard ### I haven’t donated any money but I did chronic research on the cure to the point I can’t see anything else that I can say I haven’t seen that before.. and I know it’s never gonna go away and that’s the hardest part. ### It’s so hard to accept that you have to just “live with it.” DM me anytime you need to vent your anger. I think everyone needs a safe place to do that and some people on this sub will throw toxic positivity at people when they really need a second to be upset and have that validated ### Thank you ### ",20,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/t8lh63/forgiving_someone_for_giving_this_to_you_is/

I told them and it wasn’t mentioned again. It was put in my medical chart though that I was taking that medication. ### If it’s to list your medication just tell them you take it for cold sores, that’s what I do. Perpetuating the stigma I know 🙄😩 but I hate the awkwardness after I say herpes. ### I wrote it when I signed up for my new dentist, I have gential herpes and no further questions were asked and nothing was done differently to me it felt kind of liberating actually ### I work for a docs office. Noone is ever going to know you have herpes cuz you tell the doc. It shouldnt have issues but they do need to know. Say something happens and they get nicked by a bloody knife they need to lnow what to test for vice verse. In the case of surgery ita a common courtesy for yourself and those operating on u. If you dont trust them woth that info you shouldnt trust them to put u under and cut you. ### Say hsv instead of herpes ### If you’re on meds, then just disclose the meds as for cold sores if you’re uncomfortable. I say that mostly because you don’t want adverse medication reactions, which antivirals don’t pose a risk per se but it’s important for your course of treatment and any emergency during or after surgery. Everyone is different, you don’t want to risk your health but personally I can’t even remember if I was taking antivirals at the time or not but I got an augmentation and a lift without saying anything about it. So You don’t HAVE to tell them , in order to get the surgery, no. ### Thank you for the info! ### They usually ask if on any meds. So that makes sense ### Exactly! It’s just the awkwardness of it all. I already have anxiety as it is. Lol. Thank you. ### As it’s a skin to skin transmission the bloody knife wouldn’t be the issue .  Not hiv. 

I have read some medical professionals like dentists are at high risk of herpetic whitlow. Again skin to skin. And i imagine gynos similar.

t8qs6j,"Getting an Outbreak During First Few Dates I (M, 32) had my first ever genital herpes outbreak after a one night stand only 4 months ago. Just recently, I have met a beautiful, sweet woman whom I have been on 4 dates with. I disclosed to her on the 3rd date and she was so unphased by it, it didn't bother her at all. We have had sex twice since then and now, a few days after, I am having another (yet mild) flare up. 

I'm bummed about this happening so early into dating her, as it was scary enough having to disclose. My concern is that having a flare up this early on may ruin the relationship before it even starts. 

Do you guys give your partner foreplay/oral instead of penetrative sex if you're breaking out? Obviously I'm going to let her know and put sex on hold for at least a week until it heals. But I don't want her to go without pleasure because of my issue and then lose interest.",8,2022-03-07 09:46:43-05:00,"I dont think you should worry about this ruining your relationship before it starts. You're already doing well together by the sounds of it.

You have got over the worst, most difficult part for most people; which is disclosure. It sounds like you both handled it like a champ.

It sounds to me your anxiety about your outbreak is just that - your anxiety. I am certain she will be understanding since she has already accepted your diagnosis. This is merely dealing with the logistics now.

It's OK to skip sex for a while - you've already been intimate and can look forward to that again. As you already mentioned there's lots of other sexual things you can do outside of PIV sex. Use this as an opportunity to share other ways of pleasuring your partner, either foreplay, oral or toys. Whilst this might sound like a pain on first glance, it could be a really great opportunity to become more knowledgeable and intimate exploring with your partner. ### It sounds like your partner is really understanding. I would start by discussing with them the current outbreak. Then open up the discussion to how she would like to proceed when you do have Obs. You may find she doesn’t want to doing anything until your OB is over. Some people don’t find pleasure in sexual activity unless the other party is also enjoying the physical part of that sexual activity. It can also go the other way, she may be like heck yeah you can do stuff to me without me need to reciprocate physically. There are so many ways it can go.

what more advice do you need? ### Well, advice that reassures instead of belittles.

I’m personally tired of looking at peoples anuses, and other genitalia. Some of the photos are thankfully WTF is that. You don’t even have to go to your doctor. Order a test online or even just go to DLO directly. You don’t have to have doctors orders. ### isnt this supposed to be a community to support those living with herpes?

i did a igg blood test and it came back negative. the answer isnt always ""just go get tested""

also there is a traumatic shock associated with the realization you may have herpes. the instinctual reaction is to go ask the fastest source you can find

my mantra is if i dont like it, its just not for me and move on rather than complain about it ### I came on here to do this because I’m not of age to make my own doctors appointments, I’m unable to get to them and I don’t have like a card to buy things online. so I figured I’d come to a page where some people would maybe understand and see something familiar to help out. definitely would Never post down there though, only things like coldsores. I have horrible anxiety when it comes to things like this. ### Hey man I had an ulcer tested and the pcr swab came back negetive but I still beleive I have herpes. It’s not as simple as go get tested sometimes ### Swab tests are really hard to find tbh if you come across one lmk 
Edit also what is DLO ### You can’t diagnose hsv online. You need a test. Anyone who tells you it’s hsv by just looking at it is lying. I completely understand trying to figure out the symptoms and giving timelines of your last sexual encounter. MOD even wrote it, we can’t diagnose you by looking at it. You might have it by the symptoms presented but the best way to find out is a swab/blood test ### If you’re a minor having these issues you need to turn to your parents or an adult to help you with this. I understand it’s scary but its impossible for someone online to diagnose you. If you are already diagnosed and getting treated by a doctor, of course it makes sense to seek help online. ### Honey, if you aren't of age to book your own doctor appointment you definitely aren't of age to post your genitals online, that shit is illigal. ;)  
Talk to your parents or your school, most places in the world there's places to go get help unless you're extremely young. :) ### Did you get blood work done? ### Swab tests are unreliable. I ordered a blood test kit from letsgettested, took it to DLO (it’s a major lab corporation like Labcorp, Quest Diagnostics). I did it to humor my partner because he thought after 25 years of living with it, it might not be HSV lmao. My igg test came back with a 24. I’ve never caught an OB in time to swab it, I self diagnosed & also conferred with a nurse over the phone at the health department. My symptoms were textbook though. 

So many people are too embarrassed to ask their doctor so they come here, and like you said we aren’t medical professionals. We can’t know if it’s HSV or contact dermatitis. Maybe they squatted in poison ivy. ### what youre saying is factual but theres a human component that is filled with emotions ### A lot of these people are teenagers asking dude, probably scared and nervous to even tell their parents and can’t just go to the doctors themselves for many reasons (information, transportation, the entire process). Sounds like a you problem. Imagine getting annoyed at text lol ### And this is one of those places. Not everyone posts images (thankfully) and sometimes people need a push to get the help they need. Maybe theyre 17 but their country doesnt let them book their own. Who knows? ### Honey, I specifically said I wasn’t posting any types of genitalia, and I was talking about coldsores on like the mouth and things like that.. and the last thing I’m gonna do is talk to my school. and my parent knows it’s just not their main priority ### Still too early for blood work to be accurate ### Swap kits are unreliable but my doctor told me I had it genitally and I think I just got a cold sore so it's kind of like a diagnosis thing also the normal doctors refuse to do a swab because I already got the blood test diagnosis ### Yea I get it. Shits scary but you can do it without posting your junk online lmfao ### You right on the kids part. I still think they should censor it tho & those who want to look and help them out with a visual diagnosis can do so ### Where I come from, which is a very nice country indeed, you can talk to an adult that isn't your parents and get help with stuff. Most countries have something similar. But kids should be able to talk to their parents about things first, if they can't then there are mostly options, that doesn't involve posting illegal images online to strangers. ### Well f me for giving out general kind advice. I'm so sick of the attitude of the people of reddit ready to think the worst about stuff written. Have a nice day kid. ### i marker my post as NSFW and also posted a image description. if a pic says my penis and you clicked on it thats your fault ### Who said they're posting images?? Most of the posts I see in this sub are text only. Are you specifically searching for posts with images???

Secondly - you've clearly stated your privilege there. Many countries you can get killed for much less than having sex. ### You should’ve worded it differently honey that’s all I’m trying to say ### Oh absolutely but some people don’t even do that lmfao.

t8l3g5,"ethical dilemma about disclosure hello! i wanted to ask this sub's advice on my ethical dilemma around HSV2 disclose. 

background: i (F 27) just got out of an 11 month relationship with my ex (M 32). early on in our relationship, he disclosed to me that when he was 26 he decided to add the HSV2 blood test to a routine STD screen even though he had no symptoms. ""just to be cautious"" (which is so like him). it came out positive. since then, he's disclosed his status to every new partner, even though he's never had an outbreak.

when we were together, he took an antiviral pill every day. so far, i haven't had any symptoms. i know his ex who was with him for 1.5 years didn't either. 

**here's my question:** he was never supposed to know he had it. now, i feel like i've been cursed with this knowledge. do i need to get an HSV2 test? i may have it already from someone other than him, from what i understand up to 1 in 3 have it and just have no idea. i don't want to test positive and be forced to disclose to everyone i date- and the CDC doesn't even recommend testing if you never had symptoms. what are your thoughts? am i ethically obligated to get a test? am i ethically obligated to disclose that i HAVEN'T had a test? thanks for your thoughts reddit!",11,2022-03-07 04:01:26-05:00,"I’ll get downvoted for this but ignorance is bliss. Statistically, anyone whose had 3+ partners has been with someone with herpes whether either party is aware or not. They don’t go get themselves tested for herpes since it doesn’t get done through standard STD panels. Neither should you. ### If neither of you have had symptoms ever I wouldn’t bother getting tested ### He could have potentially had a false positive. ### I am your bf. So I got blood work done and added the test (without an outbreak). It came back positive. This was 3 years ago. I told my ex and he recently got tested and it came back negative. We didn't use condoms and I didn't take any pills. Fast forward to now, I'm dating this guy and he knows but it's like idk how accurate the test was. I've never had an outbreak (I would know if I did, I know my body)- I'm a female btw. 

DO NOT GET TESTED UNLESS YOU HAVE SYMPTOMS. ### Ya I mean I would suggest getting tested since you’re saying there’s two people you’ve been with who could have had it. Your ex did the right thing in disclosing..a lot of us didn’t have a choice because someone didn’t. Otherwise you’ll feel even worse (or at least I would) if you do actually infect someone. Nobody likes having “the talk” telling a new partner that you have it but it’s the right thing to do. ### Definitely sounds like a good chance you don’t have it considering he was safe and took meds every day but best to be sure. ### The thing is, blood tests are a pretty poor way to diagnose hsv. In the UK they won't even give them to you in most clinics. It's possible that your ex got an IgG blood test with a low positive index number... in which case he may not even truly have hsv2. Often times IgG blood tests can throw up all sorts of stress, which is partly why they dont recommend using them without symptoms. If your ex was tested with an IgM then that's even more wildly inaccurate. I'm not trying to find a loophole here for you to get out of testing yourself, but the advice from doctors is pretty clear: unless you have symptoms of hsv don't test. It sounds like you guys were about as safe as you could be during your relationship together. 

If you meet someone you really click with, perhaps you can have a discussion about sexual health testing/safe sex and describe your position, it might be that they insist on a full panel test before they begin a relationship with you as they would do with anyobe they slept with... then again they might not care. ### Would find out what his test result was  & type of test he had .  Very possible if he hasn’t had an OB that he is actually negative

But his idea to test in the first place was good. Just because you don’t test doesn’t just make you negative.  And people should be asking new partners what all their latest sti test results are ( incl. hsv) & how long after last partner they tested ### look at those upvotes rolling in 😆 ### thanks for the reply! correction, only one person that ""had it""- him. his ex wasn't positive. he never had an outbreak in the 6+ years he's known about it. ### ",6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/t8l3g5/ethical_dilemma_about_disclosure/

t8vsk0,Swollen lymph nodes Hey guys. I’ve been diagnosed with G HSV2 for almost two years now and I was just wondering if it was normal to still be occasionally having swollen lymph nodes in my underarms?,7,2022-03-07 13:26:19-05:00,"All sorts of different things can cause lymph node swelling. Any sort of infection has the potential to cause lymph node swelling.

Furthermore, a genital herpes infection would not cause swollen lymph nodes in the underarms in any case. If a genital herpes infection were to cause lymph node swelling, it would be lymph nodes in the groin area that swell, not elsewhere. ### hey there i had swollen lymph nodes under my jaw line and my doctor told me it was from an internal infection, sometimes they can be caused by HSV2 but not always, go to your doctor! ### Yea for sure. Especially if you’re getting an OB after. It’s just your body letting you know you might get one ### This answers a question i’ve had a long time.  Thank you.  I wonder if GHSV1 can cause armpit gland swelling if the person had OHSV1 prior.  Probably not but who knows. ### >I wonder if GHSV1 can cause armpit gland swelling if the person had OHSV1 prior.

No, it would not. Also, it is very uncommon for a person to have the same type of herpes in multiple body locations. Generally, that is only possible if both locations were infected during the same encounter, or within 4 month of each other.

Once a person is infected with a type of herpes in one location, they become largely protected from getting infected with the same type of herpes in another location at a later point in time,  whether by spreading an existing infection on themselves, or getting exposed to a partner's infection. This is because after one is infected with herpes the body creates antibodies to fight the virus. The body maintains these antibodies in the bloodstream and they protect from further infection. Different people generate antibodies at different rates, but by about 4 months post-infection the vast majority of people will have enough antibodies to prevent any further infection by the same type. Many people will have sufficient antibodies a lot sooner than that (eg after several weeks).

There *are* very rare exceptions to the above but that is the general rule. ### Thanks that was very helpful. ### >Thanks that was very helpful.

its okay. it will be okay. I have hsv1. and yes. some guys might mind. alot won't. I got married, had a string of eager ex bfs all who knew I have hsv. they didn't really care.

Some people have 1 outbreak and never have another one.

Others (me included) have to be on valtrex permanently or else we have an outbreak. It is really a strange virus but does get easier to live with once you have accepted it. 

If you need to chat....you know the drill ### go get some lysine st CVS / Walgreens and start taking 3,000 mg spread evenly throughout the day until this is over.   Maybe 500mg every few hours   

Lots of water to help your kidneys with the lysine.   You can also get Abreva and it may assist on the new sores but you’ll have to let it absorb for an hour before clothes go on. ### Like if you miss a pill you get an outbreak? Thank you so much for the advise. ### Wow thank you so much you are amazing. Actually have some lysine on hand, tysm ### If i miss a few pills in a row i get an outbreak.

But my outbreaks went from having +- 30 large sores internal and external for the first one to maybe 2 external if i get an outbreak now. ### avoid coffee, chocolate, nuts and other high arginine foods during this time also. ### Will do. Thank u so much. Should I go to a urgent care facility instead of waiting? Do you know if waiting would cause anymore serious problems? ### i’m in San Diego. I can literally drive six blocks and go to urgent care right now. And if I wanted to get some Valtrex, I would do exactly that. 

So yeah if you have a similar situation and there’s one nearby, literally no harm in swinging by and telling them you need some Valtrex because you’re having an outbreak. 

They’re going to charge you the $150 office visit fee or whatever. But I’d probably prioritize the antivirals.

If this is primary outbreak it’s 2000 mg a day for 10 days. 

If this is a recurrent outbreak, it’s 1000 mg a day for 3 days

spread out the doses as the half life is fairly short. ### Thank you so much. I think I will do that. Thank you sosoooo much ### ",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/t8jpgs/1st_herpes_outbreak_is_spreading/

I’ve read so many  negative experiences and a lot of redditors who don’t have it are considering leaving their partners because of it, which breaks my heart.

I met someone and haven’t had intercourse yet; I’ve been avoiding it because of it. How did you do tell them and when (before or after your first intercourse)? I hope I’m not overstepping. ### You are not overstepping at all :) I was right there after I was first diagnosed. I was scared to tell anyone but finally I started to get on dating apps and met people who didn’t know anyone in my circle just to be safe. 

And even though it’s ghsv-1 and not super contagious, I would always always always disclose before I had sex with anyone. But I would only disclose if I really liked the individual and if I really want to pursue them. 

I would always come about it like “hey I want you to know that I like you a lot and I’d love to get to know you even more, but there’s something I need to tell you before we do anything. I was diagnosed with genital hsv-1 and it’s extremely common, there’s just a horrible stigma around it. I understand if you’re not comfortable being with me because of it, but I would love to be with you. Let me know if you have any questions.” Etc. something along those lines. 

But please know that you deserve to be loved unconditionally even if you have this. If this person won’t accept you, there will be someone else who will. 

I feel lucky with my boyfriend because he’s a little bit older than me and he understands the stigma around it and he knows I am so much more than my diagnosis. And he even said he probably has oral hsv-1 but he has never had any symptoms. 

And it’s extremely sad people would leave their partner because of this, but in that case they’re not the one for them. There are a lot of crappy people out there, but there are good ones too. :) ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/t8s909/second_ob_how_long_does_it_last/

I’ve been seeing someone for over a month now. I haven’t slept with anyone since we first had unprotected sex about 2 months ago. I just tested positive for hsv2 via swab test. 3 weeks ago I had my first outbreak. I am completely confused and unaware of when I truly contracted the virus, but am aware it doesn’t really matter. I have been having lots of sex with my current partner. I told her I’ve been experiencing herpes-like symptoms, but she tells me she is not having any symptoms. 

Is it possible she gave the virus to me and is asymptomatic? I have had lots of unprotected sex with a hsv2 positive person about a year ago but never experienced any symptoms until now. 

My initial outbreak is pretty bad. I’ve been experiencing symptoms for over 3 weeks now and it’s finally starting to heal after taking the antiviral meds. 

I’m unsure of how to disclose and ask this partner to stay with me. I have a feeling she was the one to give it to me if im just now experiencing symptoms. Maybe something triggered my first outbreak all of a sudden (stress/L-arginine/shaving/lots of sex) but I also had sex with her while I was experiencing symptoms. I thought the bumps I had were from shaving so we were still having sex 😳 

Should I ask her to get the blood test? 
Should I tell her there’s a good chance I gave it to her if she doesn’t have it already?

t8i9fy,"How/when to disclose I got diagnosed with HSV-1, 7 months ago. I’d had it for 3 years and never knew it was herpes because my ob were extremely mild. I had a boyfriend when I found out so there wasn’t really a disclosure issue. I’m newly single and have been talking with a guy, and we’ve somewhat planned to hookup, just no date yet. Anyways, I’m at a complete loss as to how to bring it up. I definitely don’t want to wait until we’re nakey. I’m just terrified of the rejection because the way my ex made me feel for having it. Tips and advice on how to disclose this please",10,2022-03-07 00:46:17-05:00,"Hey there.

I've had hsv1 my whole life and never knew I should disclose, not until sometime in the last year. I'm still learning to disclose and it's been a process. To be honest with the few hook ups I've had in the last year I didn't disclose, nor did anyone come back to me about contracting herpes. However I started dating a few months ago and what has worked for me as far as the WHEN to disclose is that when I feel the energy getting sexually flirty or if there's something in the conversation that makes me think I need to disclose I'll just bring it up. If the thought of disclosing is triggered then that's the time to disclose. Or if they ask to kiss me I tell them first.  

As far as HOW, for me it's ""hey before this goes anywhere else I just want to let you know that I get cold sores which is herpes."" Some people don't care if I don't have an active outbreak. One person was shocked that I disclose bc they have it too and don't see the need to disclose. And I disclosed to a guy last Thursday. He was a little startled but very appreciative. I encouraged him to do his own research and then make the decision. He actually just told me this morning that he won't pursue anything sexual with me (which sucks) because hes in an open relationship and doesn't want to risk his partner. I understand though. 

Regardless of the other person's decision, just be mindful that if there is rejection it's not necessarily because of *you* and it's just the herpes. Doesn't mean it won't suck, but it also doesn't mean people won't understand. Disclosing and dealing with the outcome will get easier in practice. ### What’s the location? ### Thank you so much for the support. ### This was SO helpful!! Thank you so much!! I’m honestly just scared of rejection or the person I tell to go and tell others. Mine is genital so its a little dif than your situation. The people I slept with before I was diagnosed, never had any symptoms arise. The stigma is just rough to deal with. ### I completely understand where your coming from I had someone turn me down bc of it too. Actually on Friday. I can't even begin to tell you how shitty I felt. I have ghsv2 and he has ohsv1 but he acts like there is a huge difference. It really hurt. ### Genital ### I'm sorry to hear that :/. Tbh, good for you for being transparent. I don't know you but I'm proud of you for that because disclosing is not easy especially with the stigma around ghsv2. ### Girl I'm still in and out of tears. It hurts so much. I was raped when I got it. I really liked him too. ### The way I look at it, if they aren’t understanding of your situation then they aren’t the person for you! That doesn’t mean it won’t hurt though. I’m proud of you!! ### Eff that noise.

As people become more & more aware of the transmission of HSV1 to the genitals, carrier numbers are going to skyrocket. It will no longer be a big deal, good thing or not. 

Idk… after having this for 25+ years with virtually no advances, I’ve just accepted it & will be happy enough with a vaccine. You just learn what you value, what your romantic goals are, that people who reject you weren’t worth your time or your feelings. ### Yeah my ex gave it to me so yeah but it’s all water under the fridge now ### so many gay guys do  ...i ve always had body dysmorphia so i know.. yes hsv does not help at all    so do things you enjoy,  see friends  we can hope  you ll meet someone understanding someday ### Gay men do not care nearly as much as I’m thinking you do. I’m a 21 year old gay man with a boyfriend right now, HSV- while I’m GHSV2+. You are not doomed to life of loneliness, it gets better I promise! ### Maybe get to know guys before disclosing. Like you can still seduce men and make out and all that stuff but you don't have to lead with herpes until you decide to have sex. You don't need to mention your status during the first conversation of someone you're interested in. I do think because of our status tho we have to give up some aspects of pick up culture but other than that I'm sure you can find guys to be with you. I'm a bisexual man and still have guys interested in me after I disclose.

t8art7,"NSFW Could this be herpes? :( so paranoid I cannot get in contact with my doctor until tomorrow. 
In September I got a full panel STI/STD screen for everything and it came back negative. The first week of February i got my IUD removed and got another STI screening + HPV screening which all came back negative. 

I dont shave often because i get bad razor bumps so did not notice any small bumps. A few weeks ago I trimmed using clippers and had some irritation. I always get ingrown hairs. I also horseback ride so this is a HIGH friction area. I noticed these and they haven't gone away for over a week. I thought it was an ingrown hair until I shaved the area today. There is no pain, itching, burning, or anything else out of the norm. They haven't burst or leaked. They are smooth to the touch. I'm really really paranoid 😕

Do you wear a lot of tight pants? ### This is 100% Molluscum Contagiosum.  The pit in the middle and “umbilical” dent is the dead giveaway. 

You can get them frozen off but they tend to pop up ongoing for several months.  I had to wait about a year for my immune system to completely resolve it.  Then it goes away forever.  It’s highly contagious but super harmless.  And not contagious once resolved. ### Hi yes that could be herpes. You should go in stat ### Yeah I do and horseback ride a lot as well. I posted elsewhere and got some feedback that it may be molloscum contagiosum. ### Just wanted to touch base that I went to my derm today and it was indeed confirmed to be molluscum. :/ ### Thank you! I thought that little dent was an ingrown hair 🤦‍♀️
When you say goes away forever is it just that they don't pop up again? Or are you ""immune"" to it and won't get them again?

And for highly contagious would that only be if they pop? Or touching them and then touching elsewhere?

I think I want to try and get them frozen. They are located on my pubic bone and I do horseback riding very often (5x a week) and don't want this to spread even more:( ### Was confirmed to be mollsucum today via Derm. ### Reading about it now and WTF another viral skin infection that can be spread sexually!? If my doctor is wrong about my irritation being from leggings and I have this virus too on top of herpes and HPV I'm saying ""fuck it,"" buying a nice vibrator and joining a nunnery. ### they might spread all around down there. But in a weird way this is a good thing because your body will recognize it faster and build the immunity you need to stop future bumps. ### basically your body has to build immunity, and once it does, you won’t see them again forever.  but it can take a long time (months).  you’ll have to Google as to whether you can transfer them around to other parts of your own body. 

I don’t know if I did but I tried not to touch them. You won’t give it to anyone else as long as you’ve given your body time to build immunity and you haven’t seen any new ones popping up for a while.

as for “you are immune and can’t get it again“… I’m not sure. Like if you were exposed to it again from someone else? I don’t know the details on that one. ### Totally feel that. I've never heard of it until now. I thought this was initially from irritation too until I shone my camera light in them and noticed they were clear and panicked. 

I battle HPV as well (not warts but still getting HPV infections in and off which are causing abnormalities for me). So tired of being prone to everything and anything! :( ### I was able to go to my derm today and it was confirmed molluscum. I also had several more bumps I never realized since they were so small and in hard to see areas.

I got all of them cryo'd today and hoping it helps :( ### Thank you for answering all my questions! Was really helpful. I think I will still go to the dermatologist to be safe. I feel better knowing it doesn't look like warts or herpes. 

Did you just wake up one day and notice they went away? Hoping that will happen! I'm thinking I have had them longer than I thought and just noticed them now since they don't cause any symptoms. ### don’t stress out if it doesn’t take care of it. This stuff just keeps coming back over and over and over in waves. You just have to wait it out.  it’ll disappear eventually.   Keep your immune system strong. That’ll shorten the overall duration. ### Haha.  it was a pain in the butt. I had like 15 or 20 in random spots all around down there. 

And then it would be 10 or 15. Then another week it would be seven or eight. 

Then another 10 would eventually appear. 

It just kind of ebbed and flowed like this for about 8 to 10 months.

As I got closer to the end there were fewer visible at any given time. 

Like 6 to 8. 

And then 3 to 5. 

And then 1 to 3.

Then none. ### Interesting. Right now I have just the ones noted in the picture. Hopefully it doesn't change much. Thank you for all your feedback! ### It might spread, and be widespread even, down there. If it does, don’t stress over it.

How the fuck do you disclose this to a partner without potentially compromising a relationship?

EDIT: For the record I have never had a proper outbreak, my infection is mostly asymptomatic",14,2022-03-06 13:19:45-05:00,"You cannot do it without “compromising” the relationship. Its unfortunate but true. It still should be done in my opinion however. Have you already been intimate with them? If yes you just need to be flat out honest.

If no, rather than the “I have herpes” approach I say to make it a conversation. Something like: “Hey we’ve been seeing eachother a bit, I cant wait to get you naked but health & safety are important to me so I want to talk about the uncomfortable stuff like std testing etc.” From there you can steer the conversation. If they say theyve been tested you can discuss results & depending on their reactions you can go further.

If theyre like “OMG Do you think Im some dirty person with herpes?” Then you know theres no reason to disclose, just to end things immediately. If theyre open & receptive to the discussion you can ask if they know whether their tests included HSV. Whether they answer yes or no you can then explain that the reason you asked is you happen to be one one the majority of the population of the world who has HSV, in this case type 1 genitally”

If they run screaming theres not much you can do about it. ### I would just be upfront and tell them. But let them know that it’s okay to have sex with them if you have no symptoms and that you’ve been keeping them at bay with meds and creams.

Remember that if you are sexually active in any way you are putting yourself at risk to STDs, which includes herpes. ### ""I'm HIV negative, was last tested just last month.  And I get cold sores sometimes but I don't have one now.  Do you have any STIs?  when were you last tested for HIV? Do you ever get tested for STIs aside from HIV?""

Disclosure should be a minor part embedded in a very important conversation about other infections. Don't have sex with new partners until/unless they have this conversation with you frankly.  Someone who can't talk about this stuff is not a safe sex partner. ### You don’t need to, take just the right precautions, they probably already have type 1 in the month so they won’t even get symptoms on the genitals if you infect them. Disclosing is more mentally harmful than disclosing when the risk is so extremely low.

We have a second date scheduled this week and I do not get intimate too early on with someone with whom I see a future, but I do wonder how his reaction will be to my disclosure.

I get tested regularly but I also read that they do not Normally screen for HSV1-2 which is quite interesting to me...

t8b5m2,Shingles/chicken pox vaccine to stop recurrent ghsv Has anyone here taken the shingles/chicken pox vaccine and if so has it reduced or stopped your outbreaks? I’ve been studying online and many people say it stopped recurrent outbreaks completely. Also how was the reaction from your doctor when you asked about the vaccine for hsv2,6,2022-03-06 18:14:12-05:00,"Can you cite where you read online that it stopped people’s outbreaks?

Herpes zoster (shingles/chickenpox) and herpes simplex are two different viruses. Since the introduction of the zoster prophylactic vaccine in 1995 in the US, the incidence of symptomatic HSV hasn’t dramatically decreased. ### No I won’t site it as I’m not a scientist however it was a study conducted on the efficacy of an anti-Vzv vaccine in individuals affected with hsv1 and hsv2. The study took place from 2005 to 2011. Apparently 24 individuals participated in the study and all 24 individuals outbreaks reduced to zero. I realize hsv3 is a different virus, however it is still a herpes virus and supposedly there are accounts of people who have used these vaccines and it has dramatically lowered their recurrent outbreaks or stopped them altogether. I’m sure others here have heard of this and I’m curious to hear their experience if they have any ### > No I won’t site it as I’m not a scientist

What? You don't need to be a scientist to provide the name of the reference you are referring to. Especially when you're going to talk about the reference anyway. ### You're referring to this paper: [https://www.dovepress.com/efficacy-of-the-anti-vzv-anti-hsv3-vaccine-in-hsv1-and-hsv2-recurrent--peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-OAJCT](https://www.dovepress.com/efficacy-of-the-anti-vzv-anti-hsv3-vaccine-in-hsv1-and-hsv2-recurrent--peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-OAJCT)

Here are the reasons why this paper is garbage:

(1) The study conducted was not a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The authors even state this in the paper: ""In spite of the limited number of patients involved in the present study and the **absence of a comparative placebo/vaccine randomized trial**...""

(2) This paper was published in 2012 in Dovepress. [In 2013, the journal it was published in was found to accept a false and intentionally flawed paper created and submitted by an investigative journalist for Science as part of a ""sting"" to test the effectiveness of the peer-review processes of open access journals](https://www.science.org/content/article/open-access-group-sanctions-three-publishers-after-science-sting).

(3) If the chickenpox or shingles vaccine (Varivax or Zostavax) had any efficacy against HSV-1 or HSV-2, the pharmaceutical giant Merck, who produces Varivax and Zostavax, would have likely ran clinical trials to test this efficacy. They could therefore patent the use of Varivax and Zostavax as a treatment for HSV. The company has never carried out such a strial.

(4) As mentioned in my previous comment, Varivax has been available in the United States since 1995. Since that time, the incidence of symptomatic HSV-1 and HSV-2 has not decreased even though Varivax has been widely used in the population since that time.

(5) I myself tried Varivax (chickenpox vaccine) out of desperation when I first suffered from chronic outbreaks (I have HSV-2). You know what happened? My outbreaks got significantly *worse and more severe* after trying Varivax. I was so desperate I tried Varivax 3 times (the normal regiment is 2 doses, but I did 3). And each time, my outbreaks became severely worse for about a month or so after each dose. And then my normal weekly outbreaks began again. You know why my outbreaks got worse? It's because Varivax is a live-attenuated vaccine for herpes zoster. This means that a weakened virus of zoster is introduced to the body and my immune system has to fight it off. Unsurprisingly, my HSV outbreaks got worse during this time, because my body was too busy fighting off the zoster virus. 

Since the chickenpox and shingles vaccines are both widely available, my recommendation if you have any doubt is to try it yourself and see. 

Hope it works for you. ### The title is “efficacy of the anti vsv vaccine in hsv1 and hsv2 recurrrnt herpes simplex disease a retrospective study” ### When citing studies etc, it is also appropriate to include the study authors. It's also common to include the name of the publication that included the study (eg Journal of something), and the date of the publication etc.

If you have a link to the study then it would also be appropriate to provide that as well. ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/t8b5m2/shingleschicken_pox_vaccine_to_stop_recurrent_ghsv/

So, once again unfortunately women/vagina owners are more susceptible to judgment and it is more obvious for women when they do have it. With some men/penis owners (apparently the penis is less susceptible to outbreaks) they can go their whole life and never know that they actually have it. I think once people understand how different it is from their own pre conceived notion of it being ""life ending"" then they have no choice but to be open minded because it could be happening to them and they don't even know it. Many people are not properly educated on the actual virus itself and how it manifests in a lot of different ways for a lot of different people. Keep your head up, people suck. When dating they don't have empathy or understanding that this could easily happen to them and you are the better person for disclosing outright and they are ignorant for not even giving you the time to try to understand. Best of luck, you're not diseased and there are people out there who won't even bat an eye when you tell them. I'm here for you if you ever need help or want to talk. ### I've had several fails and few successes. The fails just taught me those people were not in it for the right reason. As in, they obviously still had some sexual fish to fry beyond me. At least that's how I look at it as it makes me feel better. Like I dodged a bullet. Someone who is ready to settle down and is intelligent is more likely to accept it. Try not to let it affect your self-worth because it doesn't have anything to do with it. They are just making a choice, which they are entitled to. ### First of all, you’re doing the right thing by disclosing. The odds are unlikely, but blah blah…they’re there. I’m sure a lot of us wish other people would’ve given us the option. 

Second, hang in there. I don’t know how old you are but as time goes on EVERYONE has something. A crazy exe, a complicated thing with their kids, relationship trauma, some weird unfortunate medical condition.  Everyone is carrying something. No relationship will ever be perfect because people aren’t perfect, and if some dudes are ghosting you for this then they’re young and aren’t on the same level as you yet. There are a lot more serious problems out there. Just keep trying and doing what you’re doing. You’re going to find someone that really wants YOU. Not someone that’s just trying to get laid. 

Main take away. Give it time. ### I am a therapist, specializing in trauma, sex and sexuality. I just tested positive for 1 and 2 last month.  I did a routine STD panel that I ordered online when the person that I'm dating and I, decided that it was time to level up the relationship.  I received my panel results the day we had plans to hang out but HSV results were still pending.  I wasn't concerned about HSV because I am asymptomatic and although I'm a very sex positive person, I am overall careful and have not had a hoe phase in a long time.  We had sex that night then two days later, my HSV results came in.  I had a complete melt down. Took the day off work. Ate candy all day then told him that night.  He was pretty cool about it unexpectedly.  We both took time to process and educate ourselves.  I went through the five stages of grief and once I was done with that, I realized that my love life does not need to be over.  This forum helped me with that.  I made peace with the fact that I will need to have some awkward conversations with future partners (if my current one does not work out) however, if  those two guys ghosted you, I think they probably were going to do that anyway and it's better sooner than later. A person with basic communication skills that actually cares and is there for the right reasons, will at the minimum, discuss it with you as opposed to turning into Casper.  The trash took itself out as far as I can see.  I think there are some silver linings to catching this virus.  You will save time. I also am more motivated to take better care of my body, health and nutrition.  Hang in there. Dating is hard with or without this inconvenience.  When you truly prioritize yourself and your needs, nobody else (fuck boys included) can derail you. Much love on your journey! ### Can you share the scenario you used especially if it’s in text? And some of the conversation that lead to it? ### [removed] ### First off, I'm sorry to hear this and that its got you down. Did you ever have people ghost you before you had hsv? I feel like that happens a lot in the dating world regardless.  And like others here said, they weren't the right people. Some w hsv just quit dating muggles all together so they dont have to worry about it, but that seems extreme. Besides, you could accidentally date someone who has it too and you wouldnt know until you disclosed. Keep your chin up and take care of yourself. ### its hard i know where your coming from not a lot of people are ok with it at this point in life idk if i have any advice sometimes life just sucks and there's nothing we can do but let it be ### i have to deal with it too since i was 17 i hate it ### Thats why u get someone to love you without sex and then disclose when the time comes, they will be more willing to take the risk. ### How did you have children? ### Try herpes dating websites. If you don’t wanna go through the trouble of disclosing maybe try finding someone who has it already. ### Thanks for the pep talk! Was it a dealbreaker for your current partner? And did he test positive as well? ### You need to stop saying this to people. 

While it's correct that transmission odds are low, it's not true that most people don't get symptoms or will only have one week's worth of OBs in their entire life. 

This is horrible advice. 

u/ooohfuck ### Comment removed due to misinformation and blatantly faulty reasoning. ### I had my son via IVF via an anonymous donor. I’m also “lucky” that I’ve never had any outbreaks in the two decades after the first, but that doesn’t make me any less contagious to others. I took Valtrex during the end of my pregnancy and was able to deliver vaginally, safely. I had planned on a C-section to eliminate even the slightest chance, but it didn’t work out and in the end, he was born safely. So that took care of one of my big worries. ### Have you ever looked at these sites? Slim
pickings is putting it VERY nicely. ### He actually got his test results back today and all negative.  So far not a deal breaker just taking it slow. He did sleep over last night though ;-) ### I don’t understand, you validate my points and then say it’s horrible advice. Can you please elaborate? ### Honestly you are absolutely blessed to even be able to have a child. I know it's probably hard not having an SO to help you with such a responsibility but you have so much more then a lot of other adults who wish they are able to bear children. Sometimes we as humans tend to count the things we don't have , rather then the things we do have. My biggest fear as someone who has HSV, is not being able to have children. But thats just my humble opinion ### >I don’t understand, you validate my points and then say it’s horrible advice. Can you please elaborate?

You are being intentionally dishonest, and we don't go for that here. u/GenoFlower very clearly didn't validate your points. She acknowledged that transmission risk was low. And then she very specifically said that two of your claims were untrue. Someone pointing out that *multiple* claims of yours are untrue is hardly ""validating your points"", and that is obvious to anyone reading her comment. Her statement requires no elaboration.

When a person engages in the sort of dishonesty you did here, that is usually an indication that their position is weak. Otherwise they wouldn't need to resort to dishonesty. ### Honestly, I feel like this is condescending. Because I have HSV2 , I shouldn’t still want a relationship? I don’t want a SO to help parent- I knew what I was getting into and I’m fine with that. I want a relationship for the same reasons everyone else does. ### ",16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/t7ttmq/disclosure_fails/

t8agll,I disclosed I have GHSV 1. I disclosed but they guy I disclosed to had no idea about this. I think he has heard of it but isn’t educated. We talk about it yesterday. I sent him a few videos.

The stigma is a lot to process, especially for people who aren’t educated on it. After I disclose, I usually leave the door open for if they want additional resources to review to educate themselves. If he doesn’t reach out to you in a few days, I’d check in with him. I’ve had instances where people took the time to think about it and were accepting; I’ve always had instances where people ghosted after disclosure. ### Oh okay yea I just wasn’t sure how to go about this one. I had disclosed before and the other guys was fine with it. This one was different because he didn’t know anything.

t87k1r,Lymph node swelling during recurrent outbreak Hey everyone. So this is strange. I’ve had hsv2 for a while now and haven’t had any outbreaks or anything for a few years and a week ago I started to get those prodrome feelings and an outbreak happened. I got back on the medications but I started noticing a small swollen inguinal lymph node on my left side but the outbreak is on my groin area on the right side. Wanted to know if anyone else has every experienced this or if this is something that can happen during a recurrent outbreak. No fevers or any other symptom. Thanks for your time.,2,2022-03-06 15:26:50-05:00,"I have the node swelling issue still and have had 3-5 outbreaks a year for 4years.
