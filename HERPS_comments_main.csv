I live in New York, and a mentally disabled woman in the Yates county area had a ball python she used as an emotional support animal. His name is Ace, and his owner was conned out of giving him to someone who said they would provide veterinary care. They instead took the snake for themselves. 

The legalities of it mean that her snake wasnt technically stolen, but she again has mental handicapped. Someone took advantage of her, and took one of the most important things to her. I really want to help her, but my reach is only so far.

 I'll be contacting the local media and the police department, as well as consult my lawyer, but if i can't get her snake back, i really want to get her another animal to bond with. She is capable of caring for this animal herself, and it is unbelievable the things people do to one another.

7otfhe,"Ball python vs blue tongue skink Hiiiii internet peeps! I want to get another pet soon and kinda need a bit of help deciding. Do i want another ball python? Or do I want a blue tongue skink?

So back ground about me: I've had all kinds of pets from your basic cat and dog, to a guinea pig then a horrible horrible mouse:( ( seriously he was a d*ck) I've have multiple rats which were my favorite pets everrrr!! Then I randomly went in a pet store and saw a Chinese water dragon named him Peckerhead ( my dad named him ha..) ok so I researched after I got him big no no in my opinion because I failed to properly take care of him I was young this was new I didn't know enough. Rip peckerhead you will be missed. Then I got a ball python Lucifer aka Luci from this guy. He wasn't very social and I must confess I was slightly scared of him. ( he moved so weird hahaha) loved him for a year or so but he had a rough winter and didn't end up making it. Not sure how he was cared for before but we tried our best to help him in the end it wasn't enough.  I also had no idea how old he was so yeahhhh... the next pet I got 3 years later was a beautiful bearded dragon  from a very nice breeder. Did my research for months asked my co-worker tons of questions..annoyed the breeder with soooo many more questions.  Bowser was the best ever super chill dude put up with my sh*t. He passed away 2 years ago broke my heart.

So now finally after that super long read you will see the point. I kinda want a new reptile and I've always wanted a blue tongue skink only ever saw one in person. I've done loads of research and I totally want one however I want to try again with a snake. Since Luci I have met tons of ball pythons and talked to their hoomans. I know what I need to do better this time. I'm rather torn... what do y'all think? Has anyone had any experience with having both? Or do you have one and think they might be better than the other?  Any advice is welcome and appreciated thanks :)

** Also please note I am much much older now and better able to care for them properly vs my young dumb ass self who just wanted a cool pet. ",4,1,2018-01-07 16:18:17-05:00

7djk4k,"Reptile Room Suggestions? Hello everyone on r/herps

Now the advice you all give me here won't be used until I get my own place when I'm done with college, so probably 5+ years. However I've been looking around at reptile rooms and have found them facinating. So out of curiosity if money was not much of an object (future plans raking in that Sweet pediatric nurse practitioner money) what would you all suggest I get with the following conditions.

1) I live in Alaska, so aligators, monitor lizards, anything that needs/would be happier with an outdoor enclosure is off limits.

2) Nothing venomous or poisonous. State law and all.

3) ABSOLUTELY NO SWAMP FROGS. My personal phobia. Probably should steer clear of insects and arachnids too.

4) I will not be intended at first to become a breeder, so only one maybe two of each species.

5) It should be reasonable to find or have shipped with little (>$100) extra cost. And legal. Hey I managed to find an axolotl up here so who knows.

Again, as time matches on people change so I may never use this, or if I come across someone who isn't into reptiles but is into me, I'm taking the human. But I'm curious what reptiles comes up with for me.

If it helps my previous experience with reptile pet ownership includes:

* Nursing an injured snapping turtle that ate our wires when I was a kid

* Taking care of box turtle's I found on the road before releasing them when I was bored

* Some African tiny frogs that never left the water, my brothers gold fish ate their fins.

* Keeping a Russian tortoise (with a very picky diet) until he ended up running away when I was letting him play outside once.

* Working with alligators, an alligator snapping turtle, bearded dragon, ball python, eastern box turtle and Russian tortoise volunteering at a museum

* And my current pet Toothless the axolotl currently happy and swimming and hopefully will remain that way for the next 10-15 years.

Not sure that makes me high beginner or intermediate.",3,2,2017-11-17 03:46:33-05:00

6anhg5,"Here is some help for any who struggle with parents I struggled with my parents allowing me to get a snake for about a year and a half. It was quite a battle. Every day I would ask or mention it. Every day they would say no. Until one day I sat in my room and wrote a professional argument for why I should get a snake. And now I am getting a ball python tomorrow. Do not lose hope. Here is the argument I wrote. This is free for anyone to use verbally but if used in an essay or report, please cite me. Message for more details on citation. Without further ado, here is the essay 


I am a human much like all others in the world. I have my interests, and disinterests. And lizards and frogs are cool. Don't get me wrong. But snakes are where my heart is. If a four year old wants a red truck from the toy store but there is a blue truck for cheaper, what will happen when you get the blue truck? He will play with it for a while, but grow bored with it because it isn't what he wanted! But should he get that prized red truck? He would cherish it and play for it for great lengths of time. The same applies to pets. If I wanted a snake, and I got a lizard, it would still be cool. But my level of interest is not high enough to provide the best level of care possible to that creature created by God himself. In order for me to give a living creature the best care possible, I would need to be on board with it. And I am on board with snakes. So please. I beg you. Hear me out. Allow me to prove myself this one time and should I fail, no longer must you listen to my cries. But should I be proven right, you shall bite your tongue and take my word with more salt than yours carries. I rest my case!

By the way, this written argument can be used for any type of pet. The argument stands strong. ",0,4,2017-05-11 18:28:43-04:00

598qg9,"(Australia) Central (Bredli) Python belly scale shed (suspected burn to sustained heat) My pythons heat mat was left exposed overnight after my snake managed to move the cover off it and as a result has spent a night on an unprotected heat mat. I quickly fixed the problem and normalized the enclosure. 

The next day he did not come out (usually sleeps on the couch) which I brushed off as a little strange and left him before taking him out the next day. A couple of his scales (4 or so) evenly spaced, some near his neck others at the tail, started to peel. 

A couple days later he was peeling all over his belly and started showing signs of going into shed (milky eyes, hiding). two days later his belly is no longer peeling after I had bathed him in warm water (with a suitable disinfectant) which seemed to stop the peeling. I have increased the humidity by putting a slightly damp pillow case in his hide underneath him to help with what seems to be a forced shed (and a bad one, but not too awful). 

Am I doing anything wrong? I have considered it to be scale rot (bathed in warm water with disinfectant as mentioned); but seems unlikely. He hasn't eaten since his last shed (maybe once) that was about a month and a half ago. His scales on his body are overly white but are attached and not peeling.",0,1,2016-10-24 22:36:03-04:00

3igjzk,"Bearded dragon question. So I feed my breaded dragon about a day ago I feed him crickets. He got every single one and seemed all happy and full. I let him be to digest. I went to give him dinner some greens and more crickets when I put the crickets into the tank he didnt move after them like he normally does. I figure he will eat them in a little bit maybe just was not hungry. I kept checking on him and he didnt seem to be eating. 

So to get to the point. He seems to act fine and move around and seems normal when I hold him. He wont eat and has been a day and half now maybe. Is there something wrong with him? How long can they go without eating? Is not eating for sometime normal? I thought they had to be fed 2 to 3 times a day. I am doing research but to see what I can find but figured I would ask here to see if anyone else has the same issue. 

Edit to add info about habitat.

Bedding is some sand i think vita sand.
UVB for the day hours normal on from about 7:30 am to 11 when I go to bed
Day lamp on the same schedule
Red night lamp on obvious opposite schedule
Feeding times are kinda infrequent
In the tank 
He has a half log to either go under or on top
a small stump like thing
some rocks/stones
artificial leafs
a hammock thing petco sells.
There is no back ground-Should I get one? Will it help?

I think last I checked temperatures were at were they are recommended ill have to double check again to get exact numbers.

I think he may be about a year old judging by length. He is also in a 40 or 50 gallon tank has plenty of room.

3dmr9j,"Lizard-sitting, he got hurt, could use some advice (leopard gecko) I am lizard-sitting for my coworker, a little guy who first came into the shelter special-needs. He has a back injury and can't really use one of his back feet. I loved taking care of him then, so I happily agreed to pet-sit him when his adopter/my coworker went on vacation!

So, murphy's law happened and the morning I was to take him, his skin was bleeding. She thought he was shedding improperly and took him to the vet, but it turned out that one of the heat pads under his tank malfunctioned, of course as he was shedding, and he actually had some burns. I didn't handle him last night except to put on his ointments and try to feed him. I checked on him at 3am, he was fine. I woke up at 8 and his tail was almost completely detached! This concerned me because I was so careful not to touch his tail when I was handling him. I called her vet and she wanted to make sure he was OK, she took the tail off the rest of the way and I'm to put his ointments on his tail-stub now. 

My coworker is very upset (this poor girl is the sweetest person, she's great with the animals at work and has so much compassion, she really took to this little guy and wanted to adopt him so badly!) She's confused because she was always told that the undertank heat pads were the safest way to heat. Now we've got the heat pads on the side of the tank instead (per the vet's recommendation) 

SO my biggest question is, what do you think about undertank heat pads? What should she do that is safer, now that it's clearly not as safe as she thought? ",4,3,2015-07-17 11:11:05-04:00

For the past two years the basement where he lived stayed pretty cool (40-50 f), so even though I provided a heat light he wasn't very active and didn't eat much. He seemed to stay in good condition though, so I figured his metabolism had slowed to near hibernation. I moved last August and suddenly his appetite seemed to drop off. He ate really well the first half of the summer, but he's hardly eaten at all the last two months, so I'm afraid whatever stores he has may to be getting low already. The basement where he'll be staying this year is warmer, about 60f on the coldest day so far, and I'm worried  that it's too warm for his metabolism to slow down, but not warm enough to make him want to eat. Should I try to warm him up and get him eating again, or try to get him closer to his natural habitat and cool him down?

I just left him alone cause I see them all over my house and figured he was just doing his thing. Next day he was in the same spot so I figured he was dead but I touched him and he moved. I still left him alone figuring it was best to not do anything. Anyways today I checked and he's still there and still alive but looks very weak and appears to be dying slowly. It's very small so I can't really touch it and it has a small wound on its neck.

It seems to have it's neck in a weird position as if there is a neck injury, and it keeps it's neck that way no matter what. Seems like maybe a spider or something attacked it as the wound looks like a bite mark of some sort.

I put a drop of water near him and he jerked and a black thing came out of his mouth (I assume.)

Anyways, before I put the little dude out of his misery is there anything I can do? I put him under a heating pad and gave him some water but he isn't drinking anything or I can't tell. 

I don't know shit about lizards so maybe someone can tell me. It's very small and seems kind of skinny so I'm assuming he's just going to starve to death.

I also want to be able to see him when he is in his cage, but I cant have the netting, or chicken wire if you will. I live in AZ so the cage needs to be able to hold some humidity.

udq4r,"Can anyone help identify this lizard? Hi! My parents live in Indonesia (Java, if that matters) and they found a lizard in the garden which they would like identified out of curiosity.
They described it was a darker colour (brownish) when it was on a tree, and green when it was on the fence. They also said it had a very long tail.
Now I absolutely don't know anything about herpetology but a bit of googling came me to believe it is a [Bronchocela cristatella](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchocela_cristatella), but it apparently doesn't have a really dark spot behind the eyes and it wasn't threatened when it was brown. It also puffed the neck as you can see in picture 2 when my parents came close.

I am hitting some walls however and am hoping some knowledgeable redditors can help me. The knowledge I seek on the animal is inexhaustible but I made a list of the most urgent things. 

What are its senses like? How well does it smell with the nose? Does it smell the air with its tongue?

What do males do when they encounter each other in the wild? Do the have a ritual? How do they fight each other?

What do their calls sound like? What do their mating calls sound like? Actually how many sound can they make?

How fast are they generally? How fast are they when trying to get away. Does breathing require them to stop after (x) steps or (x) amount of running. How active are they generally. Do they hunt food or do they wait and ambush?
How much time do the spend on the ground? How dangerous is it for them to be there? Are they mostly tree dwelling?

What are their natural predators? What is their pray? What is the name of the foliage in the area? What fruits do they eat? What nectar do they eat? What animals coexist with them in their environment? What do they do to combat predators?

What is their mating ritual? Do they have any relationship with their young?

What are all the meanings of their color changer?

Can't think of any more for the time being but if you can answer any of these that would help me a lot.

Also please refrain from ether linking to or answering from wikipedia. Been there done that. If you can point me to a great source of information that would be awesome. Well that's it for now.

I was majorly confused to say the least the heating pad was plugged in but it wasn't heating. So, I put my hand under his tank (which is a Sterilite tub it's pretty big he's currently a baby and I was going to save up money for a nicer tank once he was to big for the plastic tub.)
The heating pad wasn't warm at all and I felt hot pain that I had to pull my hand back. So, I took everything out of his tank, including him. Inspected the pad and I have no Idea how, but there is a tiny hole with wires poking out and I actually shocked myself. (I felt the heating pad up when it was plugged in).
I'm posting on here and hoping to get good advice. I'm going to buy a new heating pad (I have a Zoo Med Pad it's a medium size).
Is there another heating pad/brand I should get? Is there a way I could potentially fix the heating pad? I only had the heating pad for 2 weeks and it broke. . . And could have potentially start a fire. (On his cooler side I have a blanket under it and around one side I use it has a buffer between the window and his tank) The blanket was like 2 inches away from the hole.

TL:DR
Heating pad has a little hole where wires are sticking out. That shocked me and could have potentially start a fire. It's a Zoo Med pad (medium sized) and I've had it for only 2 weeks. I was using it on a Sterilite Tub (Asked multiple breeders and the guy I bought it from said it should be ok)

First of all Geek is just over five months old and was purchased from PetSmart.

1. How can I/When can I/Will I be able to tell the sex of Geek?

2. Geek does not seem to be nocturnal. At all times during the day I find him (I've elected to believe Geek is a ""he"" for now...) just hanging out on his rocks. Is this my fault? His room is quite chill-axing. There isn't much light and/or activity during the day. Is he confused? Right now he has two lights on his tank one red and one blue in addition to an under the tank heater. Is that messing with him?

I'm hoping to get him some crickets today (he's been on mealworms for a little too long as our pet stores ran out of the right size crickets for him) so he can get some fun hunting in tonight. Perhaps that will put him back on schedule.

isgp5,"HELP!! Anyone really know about African Dwarf Frogs?? I think mine is dying... =( Hello!

I had a couple (as in a male and a female) of Dwarf Frogs for about a year until about two weeks ago when the male (Froggo) died. 

They had both been doing great, I even caught them having some sexy times about a month ago, and then, out of nowhere, Froggo began to lose weight really fast... it seemed like the female (Frogga) was devouring all the food that I gave them, and although I did see Froggo eating, it seemed to not be enough, but I figured he was having some sort of odd sickness and would get better soon. I tried googling his condition, and found nothing. Then, one night he was swimming in the oddest way ever. I mean, I've had them for a year, so I've seen all the shenanigans they tend to do, but this was different. The biggest difference was that we was swimming upside down, and it seemed like he was being possessed or something (I know he wasn't possessed, but he just swam very oddly). The next day, I saw him in the morning moving and stuff, but when I came back in the evening, he was dead. 

Anyways... after he died, Frogga seemed to be doing just fine, until a couple of days ago when she suddenly stopped eating so voraciously, and has begun to lose weight as well. Today, she's swimming just as Froggo had been swimming his last night, and I'm afraid she might die soon. 

Does anybody know what is going on with them?? Is there anything I can do?? as of right now, I've taken her out of her tank, and I have her by me on my desk on a container with fresh, treated water, and lots of food to see if she eats. I don't know if this is the best idea, but I don't know what else to do. Can anybody help me?

Some background info: I have a 8 gallon tank with two Plecostomus, and the one frog after the other one died, so it's not like it is overcrowded. Neither of the frogs look any different from what they've looked like for the past year, other than having dramatically lost weight. The Plecostomus are fine. I clean the tank regularly, and the fishes and frogs are fed daily. 

[Edited some grammar mistakes and typos]

[EDIT 2] I just noticed that all her little superficial veins look really red... is that normal?

[EDIT 3] I uploaded a video I took of Froggo during his last night, when he was swimming all weird.. here it is: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZd3WZOyvEk

After reading through some of the posts here and reading through a link to http://bluetongueskinks.net/ I think I'm going to be going with a blue tongue, largely because it's my first reptile and I'm a little squeemish about the idea of live food (I know, I know, it's silly, but it would make it easier to convince my landlord too). 

One thing I saw on bluetongueskinks.net was that you can feed your skink good quality catfood as it's protein intake. They mentioned mixing in the occasional silkworm or two, but I was wondering whether this was necessary or just a treat, and if necessary how I would go about storing the silkworms.

What's r/herps two cents?",13,6,2011-05-31 20:44:32-04:00

hjick,"Gargoyle gecko became aggressive suddenly.  Help? Hey guys,

I have a five year old male gargoyle gecko who's always been very sweet, but a little skittish.  I handle him three to four times a week, and change his water and food everyday with no problems.  Out of the blue, when I went to change his water today, he hissed and lunged at my hand.  This has never happened before, and I'm confused as to why he would suddenly do this.  He's alone in his enclosure, there have been no recent changes to his environment, and he's never shown aggression at all before.  Any ideas what caused it?  And what I can do to prevent it in the future?",12,4,2011-05-25 00:22:01-04:00

h3jeb,"Just built a terrarium for my beardie. Need advice. I just built a 4'x2'x2' wooden box and an error in calculations has made light placement a problem. I'm trying to avoid dome lights sitting on top of the box and wired all my fixtures inside the tank. However, when I made my fake rocks I stacked them too high (glued and grouted in place) and had to place fixtures for the lights onto the side of the box and use [this bulb](http://www.exo-terra.com/en/products/sun_glo_neodymium.php). Because of the way I placed everything, the normal, wide dome bulbs will not fit.

It is only a 40W bulb and so far the temp on the basking spot is about 93 degrees. My question is, would two of these bulbs side by side possibly create enough heat to raise the basking temp a few more degrees? 

Here are some pictures I took for perspective. It was kind of hard to describe all that.

h1p3b,"Advice on a snake for a younger kid My 8 yr old daughter has always shown an interest in snakes and has asked for one as a pet for a few years. In March she caught a small brown snake (no positive ID on what kind) and brought it home. We were not prepared to keep a snake, but we did manage to set up a small temporary shelter for it and add a little warmth with a small lamp. We were planning to get a proper habitat at the pet store the next day, but when we woke up the snake was dead. We have no idea if it was something we did or if there was just something wrong with the snake. In any case, my daughter was heart broken over it.

Now we've discovered a black rat snake living in a grown up area next to our house. This one we positively ID'd with a neighbor who works a lot with snakes at the local Natural Science center. It's somewhere between 3-4 feet at a guess and fairly stocky at an inch or more in diameter. In any case this is not what I would think would be a good starter snake. But, my daughter is even more eager to have a snake of her own.

From what I've heard, corn snakes are really good for beginners. Is that the consensus of /r/herps and what recommendations for the best information about taking proper care of them? Also is 8 too young to look after a snake in the first place?

Everything was fine for a while and i was very pleased with how well the potting soil was keeping the humidity where i wanted it.  But about 3 weeks ago i noticed 100's of little tiny white bugs in his swimming bowl.  Lots of them were dead but lots of them were still alive and appeared to be hopping around on top of the water.  I clean his water out daily and it seems like some days its full of the little things and some days it isn't.  Well today i noticed a few flying around inside the cage and a couple crawling on his dirt.  At first i was thinking it might have been a parasite because they seemed to be in his feces but now im thinking it may be the dirt.  If thats the case why would it take them a month and a half to appear when i keep the temperature and humidity at 80-85 year around?  I just need to know if they are harmful and if so what steps do i need to take.  Also is there some kind of medicine i can get for parasites?  Any advice would be great since we don't have anyone that specializes in anything around here.  The best we have is college students working at petsmart that are barely smart enough to scoop a fish into a plastic baggy.  

[bugs](http://i.imgur.com/i6Fzf.jpg)... this is before i cleaned it out for today so don't think it is always that dirty.

This is my first post here and I was wondering if I can get some help. So I'm taking care of a Chinese Water Dragon (Physignathus cocincinus) and recently his skin has turned from a normal forest green to a very dark greyish colour and he's been looking very sad.

I checked to make sure that he has plenty of food and water, and checked his lights and heat lamps in his cage and they were normal.

I looked it up on the internet and it seems that whenever they are stressed out, they kind of turn black. Recently our animals facility got a new giant lizard (I'm not sure its species) but she is over 3 feet long. We keep her in a cage next to the Chinese Water Dragon's cage. Would it be possible that the two lizards next to each other is causing problems?

d4732,"Need advice building and setting up a naturalistic ball python terrarium, please. I've had a ball python in a bare bones terrarium for about 1 year now.  He's getting a little big, and I'd like to expand and redecorate.  

Terrarium:     Since I've had him, he's been housed in a glass 40-gal tank.  Since I don't want to spend several hundred dollars on a new tank alone, I was wondering what materials would be suitable for building a new tank.  Clear plexiglass or something similar seems like the most economical material, but I'm concerned that the heating mat on the bottom of the terrarium might cause problems.  Has anyone built or seen a plexiglass tank with a heating pad?  problems?

Substrate:     For the most part, he's been on Aspen bedding, which is pretty easy to take care of.  I've been reading some online about a naturalistic substrate, specifically something consisting of several inches worth of material like peat moss.  From what I understand, a moist sublayer would provide humidity, as well as a habitat for bacteria that would digest small fecal particles.  This type of bedding would also allow my snake to burrow during shedding.   Once concern I have is that the thickness of the bedding might decrease the effectiveness of a heating pad...thoughts?  What types of bedding have you guys used for providing ball pythons or similar snakes with a naturalistic environment?  What sort of maintenance is required?

Decoration:     Right now my snake seems content with a log and a large water bowl (12"") for decoration.  I'd like to construct a larger hide box out of wood; any suggestions for materials to use/avoid?  He also seems to enjoy climbing more than most ball pythons i've seen, so i'll probably connect the hide box to a climbing feature of some sort.  Any other advice for features, such as plants or decorations?  He is about 4.5 feet long now, I'm looking to construct a tank about 6 feet long and 2 feet wide, so there will be plenty of open floor space.",3,3,2010-08-22 18:46:33-04:00

d1ap9,"Free Range Geckos for Roach Control? So, I live in NYC and I'm worried about my roach infestation.

I [posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/cyh5s/how_do_i_win_a_war_against_cockroaches_in_my_new/) to /r/NYC to see tips for getting rid of the buggers. Unfortunately, most answers involved nasty pesticides with mixed-results and some advice to take rather extreme measures (like *moving*.) 

However, the top-rated comment was a suggestion to get a Tokay gecko or a Mediteranean house gecko, and allow it to live free-range in my house, feeding on the cockroaches until they seem to be gone, and then keep it as a pet.

I am allergic to cats (one of the other suggestions) but have always wanted a pet so this sounds like a potential two-birds-with-one-stone kind of deal.

Unfortunately, some brief googling didn't turn up a whole slew of sites letting me know how to act on this advice, so I'm wondering about its accuracy. [This](http://ask.metafilter.com/16090/Can-I-control-roaches-with-a-gecko) Ask-metafilter thread is the only other discussion of the issue that I could find, with people weighing in on both sides.

I live in Brooklyn. One or two of the roaches are huge - I estimate them at 4-5 inches. However, most of them are small - maybe 1 inch to an inch and a quarter long. 

I think I could keep the lizard(s) in the apartment - we have screens over all the windows and I stuffed steel wool into any of the cracks I found. The place is very small, and as of yet (we just moved) doesn't have very much furniture but we'll be introducing a couch and a table soon. (And someday - a cage? How big a cage will I eventually need?)

Is there anything unethical about this?

Anyways, I thought /r/herps might be able to help me out with some advice on this.

Nice name, btw.

**TL;DR** Can I let a Tokay gecko or other lizard roam free-range in my NYC apartment to get rid of my cockroach infestation?
