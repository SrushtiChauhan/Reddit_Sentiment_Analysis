I‚Äôm trying really hard not to fall into a state of depression, but I‚Äôm definitely going through grief.

I saw this fling she and I had ending, and it feels like my future plans have been completely derailed. I asked myself if I‚Äôm putting too much emphasis of my future plans around a partner. 

But as soon as I opened IG, I saw all these beautiful girls on my discover page (let me live I‚Äôm a 29 yr old guy) and I just immediately overcame with sadness. Am I sad that I won‚Äôt date an influencer? No

But do I feel like my dream girl will immediately judge and reject me once I find her - yes.

typdhg,"Western Blot Update I already knew I had hsv1 because I got it from my ex many years ago and I got an oral outbreak. I get cold sores maybe once every year. 

I got tested for hsv1 and hsv2 via igg after a new partner in 2019. Hsv1 was always positive. 

But for hsv2- results showed equivocal after 4 weeks and after 8 weeks positive. At that point I accepted I had it although I never had any type of outbreak. 

5 months later in March 2020, another igg test showed equivocal again for hsv2. Put off the WB bc I had other stuff to worry about.

Recently met someone I really cared for and disclosed. It did not go well and at that point, I decided I should probably do the WB because I suspected I probably didn‚Äôt have it anyway. But I‚Äôve disclosed and told people for almost 3 years that I am hsv2 positive.

And I‚Äôm not. 

WB showed hsv1 positive, Hsv2 negative.

This experience has changed me immensely and made me so much more compassionate.. It‚Äôs also made me see how infrequently people actually test or know their status and it‚Äôs helped me see the type of people I want in my life.

Like many of us here, my herpes diagnosis caused me a lot of mental and emotional turmoil. I had already been developing depression and anxiety before that I found out I had herpes. For a really long time I felt like I wasn't worthy of love or good things.

I won't say everything is perfect. I still struggle sometimes and have depressive episodes sometimes. But every day I decided that all I could do was get up and try my best. I decided to apply to grad school, having little to no expectations of getting in. And then an email came in saying that I got in!

I never really thought much about my cold sores and didn‚Äôt really see them as a big deal until a couple months ago when I started looking into everything a bit more and starting to feel a bit depressed about getting cold sores, especially with meeting people as I feel like no one will want to date me.

I‚Äôm 26F in the UK, and have never had a BF before but I feel like I never will which is quite depressing.

tyokj3,"Is this Herpes? Nervous first time poster Hi everyone,

I (she/her) would really appreciate some advice on a lump I found between my mons pubis and inner thigh area (far outside my vagina where my pubic hair is). Have uploaded photos of it a few days ago and now - see link.

[https://imgur.com/DQrCeYC](https://imgur.com/DQrCeYC)

[https://imgur.com/a/5GJR1oE](https://imgur.com/a/5GJR1oE)

First noticed the lump a few months ago after I'd done yoga. It felt/looked like an inflamed follicle from an ingrown hair from shaving which had been irritated by tight leggings. It felt like a hard round boil under the skin directly where the lining of my pants had rubbed near my pubic bone. It felt tender in the way a boil/spot does. I've had folliculitis and boils in the past from sport so assumed it would be this.

After a while, it came to a head, in a red hard-ish fleshy lump that looked like a boil that had come to a head. One day it must have ruptured as I found some spots of blood in my underwear where there had been contact, though there wasn't any puss at all. Gradually over several weeks the lump went back down. I never saw the typical crater appearance of a Herpes outbreak and no scabbing/crusting at all. After the lump slowly died down and went away, it left a barely noticeable bruise/ discoloration, as if the spot had been popped.

It surfaced again about 2 weeks ago and in the same place and same way. It looks as though it's ruptured again and bled slightly and now is a red raised fleshy lump. It feels tender but does not sting or itch at all.

tylomx,"HSV IgG negative but still symptoms Hi everyone. This is my first time posting but I have had a long history with herpes as I had a partner of 5 years who had GHSV2 while I was negative. We always used protection and avoided sex when he had symptoms. The last time we had sex was September 6, 2021 (protected and he had not visible outbreak/prodrome symptoms). It has been approximately 28 weeks since then. I have had a history of recurring paper cuts/tears on the vulva for years now that I have had swabbed multiple times and is always negative. The cuts are linear, the tears are circular-ish. I have also had HSV1/2 IgGs drawn multiple times and always negative. I had both IgGs drawn on October 1, 2021, November 24, 2021, and most recently April 3, 2022. With all of that being said you would assume I can stop stressing about this, but I keep getting these reoccurring cuts/tears. The tears don't scab over and I have never gotten any blisters, but the lesions do occur in the same spots every time. The lesions are uncomfortable to touch and itch sometimes. No fluid is ever present. I have never had flu like symptoms. I also experience intermittent tingling and itching in the sacral and vulvar area. Recently, over the last two months, the tingling, itching, and lesions have been almost constant with maybe a couple of days of relief here and there. I got a full panel STD test on April 3, 2021 and everything was negative. BV and yeast are always negative. I guess my question is, is there still a possibility this could be herpes? I have the tears/cuts right now and haven't gotten them swabbed. The last they were swabbed was January, 2022 and negative at that time. I'm not sure if they did a culture or PCR. I have spent so much mental time worrying about this and money getting tested and retested at this point, but I would feel terrible if I did ultimately have it and gave it to someone. My OB always tells me to just shower after exercising so I am assuming she thinks this is a hygiene issue, but it is not because I do have good hygiene. I guess I am just seeking some advice from here as to whether let this go, potentially move forward with the Western Blot, etc. Thanks!",6,1,2022-04-07 16:13:06-04:00,hsv igg neg still symptom hi everyon first time post long histori herp partner year ghsv neg alway use protect avoid sex symptom last time sex septemb protect visibl outbreakprodrom symptom approxim week sinc histori recur paper cutstear vulva year swab multipl time alway neg cut linear tear circularish also hsv igg drawn multipl time alway neg igg drawn octob novemb recent april said would assum stop stress keep get reoccur cutstear tear dont scab never gotten blister lesion occur spot everi time lesion uncomfort touch itch sometim fluid ever present never flu like symptom also experi intermitt tingl itch sacral vulvar area recent last two month tingl itch lesion almost constant mayb coupl day relief got full panel std test april everyth neg bv yeast alway neg guess question still possibl could herp tearscut right havent gotten swab last swab januari neg time im sure cultur pcr spent much mental time worri money get test retest point would feel terribl ultim gave someon ob alway tell shower exercis assum think hygien issu good hygien guess seek advic whether let go potenti move forward western blot etc thank,"Sentiment(polarity=0.10798319327731092, subjectivity=0.27889822595704955)",0.10798319327731092,positive

Results came back negative for everything except my results were 1.89 for Hsv-2, but the LabCorp supplemental test came back negative.

In the interest of confirmation testing, I waited until April 5th to get another round of std testing done. Everything came back negative except hsv-2 was 2.45 with another negative supplemental test result. I haven't had sex in about 8 months, and I'm a little worried that increasing values is not a good sign but also the supplemental tests are negative so I'm not really sure.

While breaking up with my now ex-girlfriend she told me that I should be grateful she wanted to be with me in the first place, beacuse of my herpes.

I am positive for hvs-1G, and very insecure about it.
We had great discussions about it in the beginning about it and how small the chances actually are that she catches it (we're both women) still I told her that I'd use any protection she wanted, no oral if thats what she wanted, practically whatever she felt comfortable with. She said that it wouldn't be a problem and we didn't have to use extreme proportions of protection....

Thats why it breaks my heart that she now decided to use it as a easy weapon against me and hit me where it would really hurt.
I know I'm the one who broke up but I feel like my heart is breaking on a whole other level beacuse of this.

ty8oif,"25F, the guy who gave me my gift just keeps giving‚Ä¶ He knows I don‚Äôt want any contact with him and has tried to reach me through multiple platforms, only to be blocked and asked not to contact me each time.

I am worried he would show up at my job, he has a long history of going to lengths to get my information/find ways to access me despite my attempts to avoid him.

At one point he was in prison and sent hundreds of calls harassing me and I asked both him and his case manager to make the calls stop. In order to keep calling he would disguise his voice/name when the call prompted him to record his name.

I met some girls at my last job who I recognized from high school, we hung out for drinks and then eventually we all went back to mine for 420. I trusted them because we had gone to school together and they were always nice girls in school. Come to find out he is out of prison and is one of their roommates, had put them up to this, and now had gotten my address and was actually coming to my house to pick them up.

He has continued to have sex with dozens of other girls in the area without telling them. I found out a mutual friend had sex with him and he had specifically told her he was clean, and tried to talk her out of using a condom. She was shocked when I told her this because, like me, she had been a good friend to him for almost a decade, until he lied and exposed us both to a lifelong virus.

Tonight I checked the system at my job to see if he had ever come in, and ban him. The search revealed that he checked in for the first time ever (no doubt looking for me) on one of my off days this week. I banned him from the system, told him I did so and never to come back, then blocked him again.

I am so freaked out. After outing him to the girl who told me she slept with him, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he outed me to my job which is NOT the kind of environment where I would want anyone to find out. I have no idea what to do here, if he shows up again I will need to escalate it to management/security- the LAST people I would want to find out.

He has put me through such a traumatic experience that even seeing his picture or hearing his voice sends me absolutely spiraling. I am so glad he came in on a night I was off because I think I would cry.

Im 25M (gay male) I have ghsv1. I had a outbreak when I was 20 that's when I found out I have it. I take the medicine every day so I don't have outbreaks and have not had one since the first. made a HUGE mistake and didn't disclose to a guy I hooked up with last week. We both gave each other oral sex and that's it. I have not been able to sleep since then I feel so terrible about what I did. I feel suicidal and worse than I've ever felt in my life. the guilt is totally eating me. the guy asked if I was clean and I said yes which is a LIE. don't have anything else but I know I have hsv1. so tonight after not sleeping fifth night in a row I decided I have to tell this guy or I'm going to die from shame. I started looking up info on how I should break this news and found out that it's ILLEGAL in the state I live in not to tell someone about herpes. I know it's an awful thing to do but I did not know it is illegal. I could be sued and go to jail for this. I know this guy is going to be so insanely mad and hate me forever but if he sues me my life is definitely over. I have no money and can barely afford my rent. I have no savings at all. PLEASE DONT TELL ME ABOUT HOW I DESERVED TO BE SUED IM AWARE OF THAT BUT I CANNOT EVEN THINK ABOUT LETTING THAT HAPPEN.

I know I probably didn't give it to him through one time oral but I know there is a chance and I just feel so awful about this.

txne7r,"How to not disclose I have herpes (ghsv1) for 5 years, never get outbreaks, it doesn't bother me in the slightest.

I'm in my mid-30s, single and dating. I always disclose before sex. I had a recent encounter that I can't get out of my head.

I started dating a new guy about a month ago. He seemed great. First date we hooked up. I disclosed my status to him before sex, he thanked me and we had a wonderful time enjoying ourselves. I was happy he didn't care.

Fast forward a week, we've gone on some dates and continued to hook up. He's pushing for something serious. We are hanging at my place and we are getting undressed. We're fooling around, doing stuff we've done before, and he stops me. He says something like ""we need to be careful because of my condition"" so I ease up, to which he responds he wants me to continue doing what I had been doing. I'm confused, but whatever, we are just getting to know each other. 

But then he gets this weird look on his face. It's so bizarre I totally stop what I'm doing despite being completely naked at this point. And I ask him very pointedly ""what is wrong?"". And he says: 

""I have herpes too.""

I think my jaw hit the floor. He explains he has the exact same thing as me, ghsv1. He also says he's never told anyone besides me but ""always take precautions"" - OK so gross he's fucking other women and not telling them. I don't care about the stats, I care about a man having so little respect for women he will expose them to his herpes and even get into serious relationships without disclosing his status.

I was really confused and upset. I got herpes because my ex did not tell me he had it. When I tried to ask for an explanation this guy played the fucking victim. He was like ""I didn't want this getting out"" um you're not a celebrity so what does it matter?? I was being very polite and just trying to understand why he kept this from me and he complained I was making him feel bad. He made it clear he wouldn't discuss the issue further... but definitely wanted to keep having sex.

He doesn't know this, because he basically told me he wouldn't discuss herpes with me anymore, but this is what killed things. It totally threw me off. It made me feel disrespected. And what really bothers me is that he cares more about his reputation than the sexual health of any woman he fucks, and I cannot be with someone who respects me so fucking little. I eventually called it off but I eventually did tell him I couldn't get serious with someone who couldn't be honest about their herpes.

I am not taking on anyone's shame. I'm good with my body and my viral companion.

Moral of the story: if you have herpes, and the person you want to fuck tells you they have herpes, you better put your big girl or boy pants on and tell them in return **BEFORE** you fuck that person. Otherwise, you are jeopardizing any chance at something serious.

Like, this guy really fucking blew it. I'm still offended he played the victim for not disclosing to me.

I am a female sex worker and this is something I have been doing per time for about 4 years. But I didn‚Äôt contract herpes when I started sex work. I contracted it way before I started this work.
I was not a sex worker when I first contracted herpes, I was a shy reserved girl who never believed I will ever be a sex worker. I started due to financial reasons .
As a sex worker I am very careful with my clients. I always wear a condom and clean up well before and after sex. And I am sure none of my clients have contracted it. 

My first genital herpes outbreak was very severe as usual. After my first outbreak I had about 3 outbreaks each year for the past 9 years. My outbreaks were not severe for 9 years, I usually used to forget I had herpes because I only had about 3 a year. 
Not until last year July/August, I have been having severe outbreaks every two weeks. Since August a week or two hasn‚Äôt gone by where I will not have an outbreak or a healing outbreak. If there ever is any space I get it in 3 weeks.
For the past 9months I have been battling outbreaks upon outbreaks every two weeks. Which I didn‚Äôt usually used to have before. 
My herpes outbreak always occurs these days at my upper buttocks/lower back.

I use the acyclovir cream on it whenever it comes out.
I take valtrex 500mg twice a day for 3days recently whenever I notice an outbreak but how many will I continue taking.
Nowadays I can‚Äôt even have sex without getting an outbreak. It‚Äôs so frustrating because it is slowing down my work these days. I am usually scared to have sex. 

I also used lysine supplement everyday for January and February but I still saw some outbreaks. 

I feel really sad. Depressed and suicidal. Because going out or even socializing these days, I have to come back home to nurse one outbreak or the other.

txwitj,"Could it be herpes About a month ago, March 2 , I met someone in Mexico while on vaca and we had sex. We started using a condom and then she took it off to blow me. Needless to say we went back to it without a condom. I talked to her prior and asked if she had any STDs and she said no. About two days later I started to develop urethritis. I thought oh shit I‚Äôve been here before in the past with chlamytia and MG infections . I delt with it for a couple of days and then decided to get some azithromycin . At which point I noticed 3 or four very small red spots /sores on the head of my penis. I took the azithromycin for the remainder of my trip 3 days at which point the sores were pretty much  gone. So they were only visible for a few days from when I first noticed them. When  I got back to the states a week later I went to walk in care.  They did all of the routine tests , minus MG , which wasn‚Äôt available , and hsv blood work. They also gave me more meds to treat MG and all of the above stis . Those next few days I felt like death. My urethritis continued for the next 3 weeks or so and then started to fade. I‚Äôm currently 5 weeks from the point of having sex and the urethritis is mostly gone but still a slight feeling of something is up. It comes and goes . I‚Äôm scheduled to go back in for retesting for stis , including MG , and hiv in 2 weeks . My Dr. Didn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs hsv , even with showing him the pics. He also said that he could could do blood work for it . Also that I may never even have an outbreak or symptoms but I would then have the burden of knowing, if so. It seemed almost as though he didn‚Äôt want to test for it. Has anyone else here had a similar experience with urethritis from hsv and similar type of spots/sores? I‚Äôm just weighing wether  or not to get the blood work done . If I don‚Äôt then what. Stop dating and wait to see if something shows up again.  I didn‚Äôt have urethritis for a good 4 months or so after my Mgen infection a few years back too so it could possibly be from that . It could also be from a similar sti that didn‚Äôt show up because I started meds before hand.  My biggest concern though is HSV. I have no choice other than blood work at this point.

txvzxq,"confused ! okay so I (21F) tested positive (through blood test) for gHSV2 a couple of days ago after getting some itchiness and bumps and realizing the last time I got tested was 3 partners ago. I told my most recent partner to get tested and he tested negative. My previous partner before that also tested negative. My previous partner before that one ALSO tested negative. I‚Äôve only had 3 partners in the last 3 years. My symptoms (the itchiness and bumps) started 2 weeks after I had sex with my most recent partner, which is in line with the gHSV2 incubation period. 

How possible would it be for me to have had gHSV2 for 3 years, not noticed, and not pass it on to any of my sexual partners (they are all male)?

How possible is it that I got a false positive on a blood test (considering I also have symptoms)?

How possible is it that one or even multiple of these partners got a false negative on their tests?

txqq5s,I just want to feel better if not I‚Äôll rant Sorry in advance for how long this is. Hi I‚Äôm F(24) I‚Äôve had genital herpes for a little over 2 years. I unknowing gave it to a guy I was casually sleeping with. Felt bad obviously. Was and still am (sometimes) an emotional wreck. A little less often than originally. Anyway we continued to sleep together on and off. I‚Äôve always tried to break it off because im not made for the casual thing. Once I do he‚Äôll either let some time pass by(a month at the very most) and come back around or immediately send me dick pics and videos to get me to come over. He gave me his number but I never used it so he doesn‚Äôt have mine so we communicate through social media. So I block his account when I‚Äôm just emotionally wrecked over the situation but he makes others to contact me. It‚Äôs always been a very sexbased situation. He always apologizes for hitting me up because he knows I want to stop. But it‚Äôs just the same thing over and over. He‚Äôs made it clear he doesn‚Äôt want to be with me and I‚Äôve accepted him treating me as such because I don‚Äôt see a better option for myself. I give in to him so easily even tho I want to stop. The time where he actually decides to leave me alone im miserable. I feel unwanted and alone. He actually told me to check this site out. I just recently broke it off again with him and I‚Äôve been crying since. He‚Äôs very nonchalant and doesn‚Äôt really show that he cares. He‚Äôs a very likable and sociable guy. I‚Äôm the opposite kinda shy. He has friends and he actively talks to other women. We‚Äôve been pretty honest with each other (minus details) about that stuff. I‚Äôve been jealous in the past but it‚Äôs died down some. I gave him 2 rules: be honest and don‚Äôt fuck me once you have a gf. I talk to other guys but it all seems pointless to me. I lose interest really fast because I don‚Äôt see myself finding anyone right for me willing to accept the herpes. And tbh I have had a hard time moving on from the other guy. I‚Äôm not in love with him or anything. I think i maybe like him because of an unhealthy attachment. I can let him go tho. If he isn‚Äôt contacting me I don‚Äôt bother him but the minute he wants me again I go back like we never even broke off contact. I‚Äôve put my own emotions and feelings to the side and still sleep with him. Aside from his actions dealing with the sex situation he‚Äôs a pretty cool guy. I‚Äôve offered to just be friends in the past and he‚Äôs agreed but then he always turns it sexual. I always ask him why me? Because when I discuss my sadness and hopelessness when it comes to the herpes he‚Äôs always so positive and says it‚Äôs not a big deal. So I‚Äôm always asking why can‚Äôt you just find someone else to sleep with if that‚Äôs all you want? His answer is always ‚Äúit‚Äôs really hard to find someone to have really good sex with‚Äù it‚Äôs not a compliment to me. Everyone around me wants to fuck me. I‚Äôve told him this but I never get a different response. It doesn‚Äôt make any sense to me that he‚Äôd put up with my mood swings and emotional shit just to fuck me. And no I don‚Äôt believe he secretly loves me that‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm saying. I‚Äôm not delusional. Idk I just want to feel better. I want to disappear. I don‚Äôt want him to want me anymore but I get sad whenever i think he‚Äôs moved on.,14,2,2022-04-06 12:56:47-04:00,want feel good i‚Äôll rant sorri advanc long hi i‚Äôm f i‚Äôv genit herp littl year unknow gave guy casual sleep felt bad obvious still sometim emot wreck littl less often origin anyway continu sleep togeth i‚Äôv alway tri break im made casual thing he‚Äôll either let time pass bya month come back around immedi send dick pic video get come gave number never use doesn‚Äôt mine commun social media block account i‚Äôm emot wreck situat make other contact it‚Äô alway sexbas situat alway apolog hit know want stop it‚Äô thing he‚Äô made clear doesn‚Äôt want i‚Äôv accept treat don‚Äôt see good option give easili even tho want stop time actual decid leav alon im miser feel unwant alon actual told check site recent broke i‚Äôv cri sinc he‚Äô nonchal doesn‚Äôt realli show care he‚Äô likabl sociabl guy i‚Äôm opposit kinda shi friend activ talk women we‚Äôv pretti honest minu detail stuff i‚Äôv jealou past it‚Äô die gave rule honest don‚Äôt fuck gf talk guy seem pointless lose interest realli fast don‚Äôt see find anyon right will accept herp tbh hard time move guy i‚Äôm love anyth think mayb like unhealthi attach let go tho isn‚Äôt contact don‚Äôt bother minut want go back like never even broke contact i‚Äôv put emot feel side still sleep asid action deal sex situat he‚Äô pretti cool guy i‚Äôv offer friend past he‚Äô agre alway turn sexual alway ask discuss sad hopeless come herp he‚Äô alway posit say it‚Äô big deal i‚Äôm alway ask can‚Äôt find someon els sleep that‚Äô want answer alway ‚Äúit‚Äô realli hard find someon realli good sex with‚Äù it‚Äô compliment everyon around want fuck i‚Äôv told never get differ respons doesn‚Äôt make sens he‚Äôd put mood swing emot shit fuck don‚Äôt believ secretli love that‚Äô i‚Äôm say i‚Äôm delusion idk want feel good want disappear don‚Äôt want want anymor get sad whenev think he‚Äô move,"Sentiment(polarity=0.02036019536019535, subjectivity=0.5011294261294262)",0.02036019536019535,nuetral

txurmu,"Tested negative for everything else. Not sure where to go from here. (TW: Rape) I was raped on 3/25 without a condom while on vacation. I‚Äôm female, age 26. I do not know the man nor do I know if he had any STDs. I was drunk and once I realized it was happening i told him please at least use a condom, and he told me he was clean but that‚Äôs probably bullshit. 

I have HSV-1 on my lip that I‚Äôve had since I was a kid, but haven‚Äôt had an outbreak since 2018. Still, I carry valtrex with me especially since I was out of the country on this vacation. My panicked brain started taking valtrex the next morning in case I was exposed to genital herpes so if I did get an outbreak, it wouldn‚Äôt be as bad. I took it for the first 11 days after the incident. 

Day 1 (next morning)- I was slightly sore and irritated down there, it was really rough sex and I don‚Äôt have a lot of natural lube to begin with so no lube was used. 

Day 3- I had an uncomfortable feeling in my urethra. 

Day 4- same uncomfortable feeling, urgency to urinate. I had to ride in a car for 5 hours and had lower back pain around my tailbone (I broke my tailbone a few months ago, but the pain was more severe than normal) 

Day 5- less urgency, uncomfortable in urethra, uncomfortable peeing, redness in vulva, lower back pain when sitting. Some thin white discharge starting. 

Day 6- same as day 5. Had to drive home, still had tailbone pain while sitting down driving. Note- I started to get sick this day but so did my entire work team, so it was unrelated to the sexual encounter. But still, had flu like symptoms (body aches, fatigue, sore throat).

Day 7- same as day 6. Went to planned parenthood, tested negative for BV, UTI, yeast, and trich. Was told too soon to test for STD, come back in a week. They said some of the symptoms could be from friction due to lack of lube. 

Day 8- same symptoms, itching around anus and redness/irritation in buttcrack, which is strange because I don‚Äôt remember us doing anything anally and my butt didn‚Äôt hurt the day after. Checked by an urgent care doctor to see what was going on with my asshole, she said it looked a little red but no sores. 

Day 9- same as day 8, put jock itch cream and cortisone on my asshole and it felt a little better.

Day 10- asshole less red. developed abdominal cramping and more lower back pain. Went to my primary care doctor (I had been out of town prior to this) and got fully tested- gonorrhea, chlyamidia, trich, BV, UTI, yeast, pregnancy. Blood test Syphillus and HIV. I wanted a herpes test but was told they only test when there‚Äôs sores. Later in the day I played volleyball and had extreme lower back pain and my discharge starting having brown blood in it but I‚Äôm not on my period. Developed a tingly itch on my butt cheek and I‚Äôm convinced it‚Äôs herpes, but there‚Äôs no blister head. Just a small red spot. https://imgur.com/a/v2lvvkr showed my doctor and she wasn‚Äôt really concerned, probably because I have other mild butt acne.

Day 11- tested negative for BV, UTI, pregnancy, yeast, trich, gonorrhea, chlyamidia. Awaiting syphillus and HIV blood work. symptoms are milder lower back pain, pain in urethra, a little white discharge, and redness/irritation around my entire vulva. Stopped taking valtrex because my doctor told me to stop. Doc told me to put vitamin E oil on my labia to ease the burning/itching, it made it ago away temporarily. I took a urinary pain relief pill and it also took away the urinary symptoms temporarily. 

Day 12 (today)- lower back pain is gone, but redness and irritation around asshole and vulva persist and my urethra burns, but doesn‚Äôt burn any more when peeing. The little thing on my buttcheek is mostly gone, just a faint red spot. Never crusted, never blistered, no pain. I basically feel like I have a UTI and a yeast infection without the chunky discharge. 

So I don‚Äôt know what to do. Is this an initial herpes outbreak that I‚Äôve suppressed with the valtrex? I brought that up to my doctor and she didn‚Äôt really have much to say about it. She also said that you can only transmit herpes if you have blisters which is bullshit, people can transmit asymptomatically. She also told me a blood test won‚Äôt do anything because I already have HSV-1. She said the only thing I can do is wait for blisters and test when/if that happens. I don‚Äôt trust her.

And you know what guys? I don‚Äôt care if I get genital herpes. Well, I do, but I‚Äôll live. I‚Äôve had cold sores on my lips before and I take valtrex and I‚Äôm fine and I continue living. I take daily medicine already so what‚Äôs wrong with adding an antiviral in the mix. 

But I‚Äôm seeing someone and we‚Äôll probably make it official soon. He doesn‚Äôt know about the encounter. I haven‚Äôt seen him in person since I got back. I am TERRIFIED of not knowing my status and giving him herpes. I feel like I‚Äôm in limbo. We already use condoms. But still I would be heartbroken if I contracted herpes from this and gave it to him. 

I have bad anxiety as it is, and the fact that I‚Äôm cleared of other STDs and still have these symptoms immediately tells me that I must be having the one STD you can‚Äôt easily test for without blisters- herpes. And I don‚Äôt feel safe having sex with him until I know my status. But since I have no blisters I can‚Äôt get tested. And blood testing wouldn‚Äôt work this soon.

I‚Äôm getting mental counseling for the rape starting next week, but from a medical standpoint I‚Äôm a mess about potentially spreading something to my partner. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

txtwtg,"Is this herpes? (NSFW photo) Hi everyone! I‚Äôm using a throwaway account because I have friends/family that know my normal account. I‚Äôm going to add as much detail as I can think of down below and then add a photo if I can figure out how to do that.

I am 23f, been sexually active since I was 17, but I‚Äôve been exclusively with my boyfriend for a little over two years, before him I had been with about ten other partners, only two of whom were one night stands, all of whom who had said they were clean. I‚Äôve been tested after every partner I‚Äôve had, most recently about 4-6 months into my current relationship, although I found out that regular testing doesn‚Äôt include herpes testing within the full panel which is disappointing to hear.

My symptoms started sometime around march 13-14, the last time I had had sex before that was march 5th. I had never had any symptoms or outbreaks or anything I could see as herpes anytime before this. 

When I started having symptoms, it started as just one bump that looked and felt like an ingrown hair. That was there for about three days, and as it faded/flaked (never scabbed, looked more like dry skin) I got a few more spots that were there for about a week & did the same thing. then, I got these most recent spots, the ones that I have a picture of. There has not been any pain throughout this whole experience, only itchiness, and no other symptoms throughout my body like the flu-like ones I read about. The spots have been centralized to my mons pubis, & one or two on my inner thighs, but they‚Äôre not necessarily clustered like I‚Äôve seen in other posts or pictures. They haven‚Äôt gone below (? behind?) the line of where my clitoris would be, I think that‚Äôs the best way to describe it. 

I haven‚Äôt been able to get tested and I don‚Äôt think I will be able to for atleast 3-4 weeks unfortunately with my current schedule.

It finally cleared up and I was fine through February and the beginning of March. About March 23rd, I got covid and my whole body went out of whack. I got an OB and BV on top of each other. My doctor gave me medicine for the BV but just told me to continue taking lysine and sleeping well...the OB seemed to chill out but the BV stayed around.

Well, it's now 7 days into April and I'm dealing with sores again, this time worse. I don't know if its just an OB sequel from the one at the end of March or if this is a new one. I'm at my wit's end. I went to a new OBGYN today who told me I need to sleep and eat well...okay thanks. She gave me a 5 day pill cocktail of BV medicine and antivirals, plus some antiviral cream so I'm hoping everything chills out past this.

My question is...when did it get better for you? HSV1 is supposed to shed way less and I see a lot of people talking about only getting one of two sores with recurrent outbreaks so why am I covered in them? üò≠ 

I realize I'm only 3 months into my diagnosis so I'm hoping everything will chill out soon and I'll go down to maybe one outbreak a year with time but....what was your timeline in the beginning? Did you experience monthly OBs in the beginning? How is it now?

txsv87,"A weird circle appeared on my buttocks I am a 19yo female.

About two/three days ago, I noticed a place on my buttocks that hurt when I touched it. At first, I thought it might be an ingrown hair or something, so I didn't pay it a lot of attention. It was in such a place I couldn't see it (about an inch away from my vulva and an inch away from my butthole). It's on my inner thigh/buttocks.

I have had one partner for the past half year, I am on hormonal birth control, so we don't use any other protection. He had herpes on his mouth about two weeks ago, but there are no visible ulcers left, so I assumed it was fine to have oral sex. We had oral sex every day in the past weekend, so I can't pinpoint which time could have caused this.

The blister really hurts if I touch it or simply when I sit on it. There's only one and I would compare it to a heat blister- it either dries or it's wet and sticky. I didn't notice any more vaginal discharge than usual, and if there was, it was clear or creamy white.

I was also diagnosed with an UTI today and got antibiotics for it. Idk if this is relevant.

I'm really scared and I will definitely schedule an appointment with my OB/GYN asap. But until then, could someone look at it and tell me, if it could be herpes? I would be very grateful.

5 days ago I got what felt like a paper cut on my labia. It stung to touch and I just assumed I'd caught it or something. It developed into a little lump the next day and now, on day 5 it's like a yellow, open sore. There's another similar one just above it, but much smaller. I haven't had any flu type symptoms, my discharge is normal, but I do have swollen lymph nodes on that side. I'm not aware of it all the time, but if I touch it it's uncomfortable and it does itch from time to time. It's hard to the touch, if I pinched it, it feels like hard under the skin. It's definitely worse today that it was yesterday. I'm trying to get to the clinic but I can't miss work and they only do on the day appointments and they go so quickly. If anyone could shed any light, I'd be so grateful. I've spent a lot of time trawling through images but can't find anything that looks similar to this.

Have you humbled down? Did it push yourself to become a go-getter and reach for your goals? What about your personality; did you become more open, did you become more introverted, did you turn your physical aspect around, did you alter your appearance? Have you taken life more seriously or, or have you been all YOLO about your decisions?

I feel like I was super tame, very introvert (wanna be loud ASF now), super go-getter and I went after the goals I set( I want to be comfortable and coast it for a while now without hustling everyday like I need to achieve something new all the time)  
depression has set me back. I'm getting out of it, however but there's a long road ahead of me. I think I'm taking life more seriously since you only got one. It's precious.  My appearance has not been what I want or how I want to look cuz I've always cared what others thought and my line of work wouldn't allow me to represent myself the way I want to but now I just don't want to give a f*** anymore!

tx2ju8,"My first outbreak experience, for anyone who is interested. Hello fellow Redditors. Let me start by saying how thankful I am to this community. I was diagnosed (f29) with HSV2 about a month ago and had the typical reaction of feeling like my life was going to change forever and that this would be what defines me. But reading everyone‚Äôs story was so helpful and it was nice knowing I am certainly not alone. So for anyone this might help, here‚Äôs my experience. 

I wish I could post the picture of what triggered me to see a doctor but basically imagine tiny ulcers appearing on your vagina. I didn‚Äôt have the multiple clumps of bumps it started with 4-5 pimple looking bumps that turned to ulcers and eventually had a total of about 10-15 scattered sores around the area (lips, clit, inner labia, thighs, a few on my butt cheek even!). 

I had been with my boyfriend for about 6 months before we broke up and took a break for a couple months. I was not active during this time but he was, and good for him, he was well within his rights to be. When we got back together, I didn‚Äôt have my usual instinct to ask about his activities or recommend we get tested because this is someone I trusted and we had already gone through that conversation when we first got together. I still trust him, even if he gave me herpes he certainly had no idea and did not mean to. He‚Äôs had no symptoms and both of us admit we were not educated on this topic at all to begin with. I‚Äôve definitely had unsafe sex in the past that could have led to the same outcome so I do not fault him at all. Anyway! We start hooking up again and I‚Äôm unfortunately prone to tearing and this time we were a bit too rough which cause some tears. Although it‚Äôs usually a bit painful, after 4 days I really felt like something was wrong. Thought maybe it‚Äôs a yeast infection? Got the meds for it, didn‚Äôt clear and that‚Äôs when I started to notice all the red bumps/sores. I went to the walk in clinic and they confirmed it was herpes. It was the most painful experience of my life. I‚Äôve had surgeries, broken bone, sprains, this was definitely the worst. I had sore all in and around the tear (which is clearly where the virus entered) and even mini ones 4/5 on my clit!! Couldn‚Äôt believe it. I had never seen this before, never been educated on this, didn‚Äôt know what to do. Ice would help but when I stopped using the ice and I would ‚Äúdefrost‚Äù it was way worse. Tried baths, pain meds, creams, truly the only thing that numbed my body and allowed me to sleep were weed gummies. So if you‚Äôre wondering how to make the pain stop and haven‚Äôt tried this yet, I recommend it!! 

I was prescribed some anti-viral meds and the sores cleared up and healed within a week. I was starting to feel better/back to normal. Two days after stopping the meds however... I developed this insane itching in what felt like the inside of my vagina and anal area. I‚Äôve never had an itch like that except maybe chicken pox or a nasty mosquito bite. Its hard to resist itching, I try to use a towel or some sort of barrier because I don‚Äôt want to tear more skin. That itch has been around for 2 1/2 weeks now at the time of writing this and post sores being completely healed. It‚Äôs not as bad as those first few days but it‚Äôs definitely affecting my day to day life. Sometimes I have burning or shooting pain but it‚Äôs mostly the itch. I didn‚Äôt understand how I could still be feeling these symptoms when everything ‚Äúlooked‚Äù normal and healed. It was like the inside of my private areas were going through something completely on their own that I couldn‚Äôt see. I found a few stories of people experiencing this but not many... from what I‚Äôve read it‚Äôs possible to have nerve damage which causes these symptoms and there‚Äôs no cure or expected timeline for it to resolve. If anyone has experienced this, please let me know I‚Äôd love to know if anything helped or get some hope that it does in fact go away. At first I thought great - here we go again back to back outbreaks so I redid another week of anti-viral meds which unfortunately did nothing to settle or resolve the issues. Lots of gummies have been consumed!! I did find that Epsom salt baths helped and would take about 3 a day. One to start the day, one at lunch and another before bed. I‚Äôm planning on talking to my family doctor this month to see what can be done and will update the post. 

Side note - for anyone who lives in Canada on suppressants - I‚Äôm also wondering how you were able to get the prescription? I‚Äôve been told you need to have 8+ outbreaks in a year to qualify... it seems ridiculous to me that they would want you to go through that. I would hope that I can make the choice of whether or not to take meds for my own health! So curious to know if this is a strict rule or not.

tx6mcb,"Supporting a partner through the guilt of giving you herpes So my gf and I have been dating for eight months. She disclosed to me when first dating and I got herpes back in January. I always knew there was a risk and I accepted it. But when I got herpes and the pain I got during outbreaks / taking exams / the guilt of my gf, it became too much and I got overwhelmed. I was also bummed because she got herpes from her ex (who she was still getting over and told me she had feelings for) and I think I had unresolved feelings of getting something so permanent from the guy that made me insecure. I was in an intense nursing program and I think I handled the stress / out breaks horribly. I became very insecure about her ex and insecure in general. It hurt my self worth, which many of us have experienced. She felt so guilty and I think my insecurities came out in horrible ways. We broke up for a bit as well because of the guilt / me not processing. After much therapy, I realized how wrong it was of me to express my insecurities in a way that hurts her and adds to the guilt. I am now out of school and have a clear head and want nothing more than to heal our relationship. I have already apologized and told her my perspective. I just wish I could take her guilt away.

txelia,"Asymptomatic hsv-1 disclosure before a first kiss? After testing positive for hsv-1 via IGg about 2 months ago, my doctor went on to say ""no kissing"" in the future, and thankfully people on here agreed that that's pretty ridiculous. 

I'm 98% sure I've had a cold sore as a kid and that's probably what this is pointing to. But I could maybe be asymptomatic with ghsv-1? (I haven't had sex in like 15 months and also, I guess according to index values, the doctor said I've had it for a very long time)

I do feel the need to disclose before a first kiss. But pretty much all the scripts I'm finding throughout this page are for saying before sex, when kissing has already occurred. Some people are saying it isn't even necessary to disclose ohsv-1 before a first kiss, but that wouldn't feel right to me. If you wait until oral sex to disclose, I imagine the person would feel uncomfortable that you didn't disclose before the initial skin to skin contact you already had via kissing. 

The closest thing to a pre-kiss disclosure script I have found was basically saying ""do you ever get cold sores?"" but I honestly feel like that's an awkward approach, especially since, even with my diagnosis, I haven't had a cold sore in 15+ years (if I'm even remembering correctly that I have had one).

The Dr says it looks like irritation, and I've been using monistat 7 and that cleared up the itch a lot. Outside of the bump and itch no other symptoms. Only 1 itch today. The bump has significantly reduced today.

Now i have the clumped blisters popping up and it hurts like hell. 

The urgent care PA told me that it really looks like herpes to him. I don‚Äôt get my swab results for another 1-2 days, but i‚Äôm 99% sure it‚Äôs herpes. I‚Äôm taking antiviral and steroid pills.

For anyone who has had herpes for years, how frequent are the outbreaks?
The PA was being very kind to me and was telling me that sometimes you only have the initial outbreak, and no more after that. He also said that it can be years between outbreaks. Is this realistic, or are these very slim odds?

tx783r,"Advice needed Hello everyone! First of all, I want to thank everyone on this subreddit for making other feel less alone navigating this situatiom we all have to live with. Now, I‚Äôll explain my situation.

I (F24) was diagnosed with genital vhs1 in 2019. It was given to me via oral sex, i think in 2016, I wasn‚Äôt aware of the possibility of that happening. I had my first and only episode that year, after having protected sex (I had a very bad allergic reaction to the condom) with a guy for the first time. Knowing the risks and having no other STDs, we continued having sex w/o condoms for the three months we dated. Haven‚Äôt dated or slept with anyone since. I have to add, i went to the caribbean three weeks ago, liked a worker at the hotel I was staying at and trusted him so blindly I put myself in a dangerous position, the situation ending in me forced to having unprotected sex in fear of my life. Fast forward to last week, after having protected sex (I‚Äôm allergic to something, not latex but something all condoms seem to have) with another guy for the first time, I started having my second episode. I just finished my 5 days of anti-viral treatment and am hoping the wounds will heal soon. I have some questions for the more experienced:

-I just got my period today, will this affect the healing process of the wounds?

-How long do the episodes normally last?

-I have always wanted to try recreational drugs, having only tried weed and alcohol. I am interested in trying MDMA and having sex while on it. Now I fear it will make me have another episode. Is that a thing?

I know I‚Äôve been diagnosed for a pretty long time, but having only experienced one episode before, doctors didn‚Äôt really seem concerned and brushed it off, making me forget about it. 

I have to add: I inmediatly disclosed the situation to my new sexual prtner as soon as I started feeling the tingling sensation one gets before an episode. He was very calm and understanding. I‚Äôm a little worried about how he will react if he gets it one day, as it was one of the reasons the guy I was sleeping with in 2019 left me after a couple months of dating... I guess I‚Äôll never know until it happens.

tx41tw,"Interesting symptoms... First off, yep, Ice made an appointment. It's tomorrow.
Also, fairly sure it's HSV.
Just a couple of odd things and questions. Sorry for the novel.

I've been prone to canker sores my entire life. Never on the lip edge, always in the mouth on both hard gum line and soft tissue, and not a cold sore. Sometimes just one, sometimes with a few.
LESS than 48 hours after activity (giving oral)
What seems like canker sores are forming. 
Just four spots. No clusters. Just individual. All tiny and round. 
One up behind my left molar, one down to the left of my tongue on the connecting tissue (not the hard part), one behind my right bottom molar, and one inside my right check. 

Coincidentally, starting taking a methylprednisolone pack the same evening I noticed these things. Sports doc has me using the steroid for an unrelated thing. 

I read that MP + Acyclovir together are great for getting rid of stuff, but MP by itself can suppress the immune system and is not great.

This is where it's weird to me. Reading these subs and everyone says these things take days and days to heal. These things were gone in less than 48 hours. More like 24. 

So less than 48 to show, 24-48 to heal.

But then five days after is HORRIBLE food poisoning-like vomiting and diarrhea for eight hours with a fever.

Now I have a gentle sore throat but it's clearing up. 

Odd variables:
Midsized group event Thursday evening (discovered the lesions a few hours prior)
Midsized group event Friday
Big crowd event Saturday around 1-2pm.
That night I ate a ton of junk, which I never do. Like way too much (not smart at all. )

And just a slightly sore throat today. It's day 6. 

Questions:
Could this be a different STD/STI?
I've read it's a weird ass virus. That onset and leaving of the sores seem par for the course?
Methylprednisolone have any impact on this?
Randomly, and 99.9999% unlikely, perhaps a weird combination of things?

Anyway. Thanks for y'all's time.

I recently had two tests. One in Aug 21, and one 2 weeks ago in Mar 22. 
Both came back at 1.13 and 1.53 IgM respectively, but no ‚Äúpositive‚Äù result was given by the lab. 

I‚Äôve never had any symptoms, never been exposed to HSV that I know of. I‚Äôve been married for 3 years, together for 5. My husband still tests negative, both monogamous, so we were curious as to how I got a positive indicator >.90

From what I‚Äôve learned, the IgM panel is typically used to check for recent exposures/diagnosis of recently acquired HSV1/2. 

However, Even with IgG, those who have recently had COVID or had multiple bouts with COVID can test with a false positive on and IgM and IgG unless the IgG with genotype is used and/or PCR testing with genotyping is done. From the articles I‚Äôve gotten, as much as 45% of the test group showed a false positive. I‚Äôll try to pull it back up and posts in the comments for review and discussion.

Similar cross typing from Zoster or Varicella can result in higher IgM and IgG as well. 

Has anyone had similar results with IgM testing and had to go back for IgG testing to confirm the genotype only to find they were negative for HSV 1/2?

tx3g7j,"A vent/advice maybe ? (NSFW) 25 m / recently diagnosed HSV 2. My value reads 4.160 , still trying to understand what this means. 

So about 5 months ago, I started dating a girl and almost immediately showed symptoms of Chlamydia and Gonorrhea. I confronted the girl and she had it as well and we both got tested and took our medications. Despite the STIs , we still continued dating (as we didn't know who gave it to whom, both of us prior were doing our own thing and really couldn't point a finger) and it we had a decent relationship. Mid-Janurary , I was incarcerated to the end of February, and during that time another girl from work was adamant about ""holding me down"" and being a friend in my time of need. This girl from work eventually helped post my bail, and when I got out we eventually ended up dating, while my ex and I were still confused about where we were at and how we felt about each other. 

Before I continue, let me state that I have a body modification called a pearl, or a ""domino"" , in which a domino, as in the playing dominoes, is carved and inserted into the skin of the shaft of the penis. Mine is located just below my head on the top of my penis. During sex, the domino will sometimes ""cut"" me an open wound just above the top incision and usually heals within a few days depending on my sex drive at the time. 

Anyways, during a sexual encounter from the girl from work, the wound opened as usual in the same location as always and I thought nothing of it as this is typical for me. However the next day , I had sexual encounters with my ex and the wound looked a bit worse the next morning. Again, I thought nothing of it because of the amount of times I've had sex in the past few days. That same morning I told the girl from work what had happened and she broke up with me (as expected, what would anyone else do). Regardless, her and I continued to mend the relationship over that week doing nothing but kissing. Meanwhile, the open wound is tender to the touch and bothering me at work as I do alot of movement. At the advice of my ex, I put a bandage over the wound and forget about it. A day or two later, I remove the bandage and notice the first sign of the blisters. Boy , did I go through it in that moment. At the time, I tried to rationalize by saying it must be an irritation from the band-aid , but went against my logic my doing my research. I came to the conclusion that I must either have syphilis or herpes and a day or two later I went to go get tested. When I got my results back, I cried and went on a drunken escapade. I told my ex immediately my results mostly bc I figured I must have gotten it from her as she was the last person I had sex with. She went to go get tested, and as she waited I was still on a drunken escapade. She kept apologizing to me as if it were her fault and I told her to stop apologizing mostly bc I was sure she didn't know she had it if she gave it to me. She's telling me she loves me and wants to be with me, and I'm telling her the same. As she gets her results, she tells me that her results came back negative and she only has a mild bacterial infection. My mind raced bc now I know I have to tell the girl from work who  we are already done and over with that I may have contracted herpes from her. I make the call ( I Wanted to have the conversation in person) and tell her my results and she is genuinely confused that my ex doesn't have it and where I got it from. I have made it a personal business to check my ex's results (just to be sure) that they are negative despite her telling me and they were true. Now I'm waiting on the results from the girl from work, and unsure really if she already knew she had it and lied, or is even going to go get tested and show me her results, or if she is being genuine. 

However, my ex is still telling me despite me testing positive, she still wants to love me and have a relationship with me. I can't help but feel that she may contract it from me and maybe sometime later use it as a guilt trip to continue our relationship. I've advised her it'd be in her best interest to move on but can't help but feel the authentic love this girl feels for me. As far as I know, I only have it in the genitals but my ex and I don't even kiss as a precaution. I also don't know if the girl from work will test positive and what her feelings are and what bond this may bring us if she does test positive. To let you know how recent this is, I found out I tested positive last week. And am sliding in and out of a drinking sprees. It's been tough tbh, and I wasnt prepared for this , much less the mess I've made behind it...

Help ?

I‚Äôve posted here a few times over the last few months. This is mostly venting. Feel free to move along. 


Just found out I have herpes cause the doctor failed to tell me back in December 2021 that I tested positive for GHSV-2. Just finished my second ob a week or so ago. 

Haven‚Äôt had sex since April 1st (lol) 2020, which I‚Äôm pretty sure that is when I contracted it. From a dude I had seen regularly for years, but that was the first time I had seen him in 6 months after he moved away.

But now that I have a new relationship, or at least the potential for sex again, on the horizon I get a breakout that‚Äôs undeniable and positive results.

twzj7j,"New herpes in monogamous relationship? Anal herpes without anal sex? Can anyone help? Hi everyone!

I know this post is so common on here but I‚Äôm just looking for anyone who can maybe relate.

I (29F) have been dating a new guy for almost 4 months. I know he has slept with a good amount of women in his life and I was naive and never asked if he had been tested for anything before we slept together. I have only been with 4 people before him so I myself have never been tested for STI‚Äôs either. 

Fast forward to last Tuesday when I thought I just had an anal fissure and hemorrhoids. Pooping was extremely painful and some Preparation H helped after a few days but it still is extremely painful to go to the bathroom. By Friday I started to develop what I thought was a rash inside of my butt cheeks. I thought it was from build up of various creams and powders I was using to try and heal the hemorrhoids. By Monday (yesterday) it wasn‚Äôt healing so I went to my doctor. The first thing that came out of her mouth was asking if I have ever been tested for herpes. She told me it looks blistery and seemed pretty certain I have herpes. My heart sank and I immediately texted my boyfriend asking if he‚Äôs ever been tested (but I know of course I could‚Äôve had it the whole time as well and never knew). She said I definitely have internal hemorrhoids but I am now awaiting test results from my doctor to see if I have herpes. I am sad and anxious and this pain is unbearable I can barely walk. I haven‚Äôt had anal sex in probably 7 years but all of my lesions are in my butt. They are sooo painful.

My boyfriend and I have been dating since January and now my brain is spiraling that he‚Äôs been unfaithful. My mom is calling me questioning him already and I‚Äôm just at a loss. There‚Äôs no way to determine who gave me the virus, correct? I dated a guy before him for about 4 years. I‚Äôm just going down a dark hole of trying to figure out what happened. Does this mean my boyfriend was unfaithful? Has anyone had this virus in their butt before and what do you do for the pain?

Thank you to anyone who has read this much. I haven‚Äôt left my bed since my doctors appointment yesterday. Waiting for these test results to come back is making my stomach so sick.

twmofp,"Hear me out‚Ä¶ I would disclose no matter what, but as a lot of people say getting GHSV 1 or 2 (I have 1) has made many more cautious to who they are with sexually- intimately‚Ä¶. 

I agree with that because last thing I want is for us go fall for each other and having to disclose later, it just seems wrong.

But if you‚Äôre having one night stands or nuts trying to get your rocks off - why disclose? It takes two the tango, if they don‚Äôt ask you if you have anything or wait until you both get tested etc‚Ä¶ why disclose? Anyone with oral HSV 1 ever need to disclose? 

Whether they have frequent or infrequent OBs ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

If the other person doesn‚Äôt ask that‚Äôs their fault.

If I had asked and did my due diligence I wouldn‚Äôt have GHSV 1. But I didn‚Äôt and these are my consequences. 

So I am OF COURSE partly to blame. 

That‚Äôs the dangers of being sexually active and not taking precautions. 

If someone doesn‚Äôt ask and you don‚Äôt feel comfortable saying it for fear or reputation, ESPECIALLY with hookups and non serious intimacy then why disclose‚Ä¶.. 

Obviously we don‚Äôt want people to go through some of the things we have, we don‚Äôt want to be that person but there are people who literally don‚Äôt care. Which is the other half of how we got stuck with GHSV in the first place. 

This is merely a thought I had, I have been sex free since my diagnosis 7 months ago and will continue to be until someone I feel is worthy and mature enough. 

 But everyone is different, I just think when I see people who won‚Äôt disclose post in this group they get torn to shreds,  but why.

tw8iyo,"Another positive disclosure story and lessons learned about having HSV Mid 30s male here with ghsv1. Have had it now for a bit over a year now and am here to share my positive story with you.

After getting my gift from someone who lied to me about it and taking some serious time to really emotionally heal from what's occurred and accept my new reality, I have to say that having herpes is NOT a world ender. Would I prefer not to have it? Sure. Has it tainted my sex life forever and changed me into a sexual lepur? No, not at all. It did change my approach to how I date, but honestly, it's for the better.

Onto my positive disclosure. I met a really cool lady, mid 30s as well, personality and values are amazing, looks are 9 to 10 out of 10, and we've clicked on a lot of levels. Before we ever had sex she was VERY concerned about sexual health and even went so far as to ask me prior to kissing if I had oral herpes. It was definitely on her mind, and I figured once I disclosed she's be horrified and have me leave. We had spent about a month getting to know one another before we started having sex.

That night finally came, and as we were walking to her bedroom and I dreading having to tell her, I fell back to what I had mapped out in my head about how I thought was best to disclose: keep it short and simple, stay confident about it, explain what it means in context to me, and ask if she's ever been with someone who's had herpes before, and see where it goes from there.

The conversation went something like this:
""Hey, before we get any further, can we talk sexual health real quick?""
Her: ""Sure, I've been tested recently, nothing came up!""
""Great! My most recent tests came back negative as well, but there is one thing they usually don't test for that I am aware I have and it's important to me that you're aware of it too. I do have genital herpes and have had it now for over a year. I take suppressive medication for it and using condoms the chance of transferring it is incredibly low when I'm not having an outbreak, something I'd definitely let you know about, as communication and keeping you protected is very important to me. Have you ever been with someone who has had herpes?""

The conversation continued, she had never been with anyone with it, but she did know some about it. She was already into me, so her reaction was just an ""okay, good to know"" reaction. Not horrified, not grossed out.

We talked a little about how it happened, the type I have, the risks of protected and unprotected and oral/PIV sex, and my experience with learning about how many people I know have it and how the couples that deal with it and their experience thus far. We probably chatted about it for 10-15 minutes and I answered her questions.

I could tell this was a whole new world for her, so I didn't try to make sex happen after our conversation. I wanted her to have space to think clearly. She wanted to resume fooling around after the brief interruption, and to my surprise, after a bit she felt comfortable and we had protected sex. Yay!

Things are still going great and at this point we're still using protection and having sex :)

So what are my takeaways from this I hope to impart to you?

* Herpes isn't the end of your (sex) life. It is a new complication that you need to deal with. So deal with it and communicate your situation to people that matter to you that need to know. Those that accept you for you will not shun you for it. 
* Disclosure is scary yes. It's also a great thing. It will tell you real quick if someone accepts you for you. If they are rejecting you, they could be rejecting just the herpes (i.e. they are really fearful and uneducated), or they could be rejecting you because they are lukewarm about you (as dating goes) and herpes will make someone who's not too warm about you move on sooner, and that's probably a good thing.
* During disclosure, DON'T BE ASHAMED OF YOUR HERPES. DON'T APOLOGIZE FOR IT. If you must, acknowledge it sucks, but don't apologize for who you are or being honest to someone about that fact. Be confident (as hard as that can be), because if you're confident about it, your partner will feel that confidence and it erases a bunch of concerns in their head. Yes, you have herpes. You also have a financial situation and you have an emotional history you carry, too. These are all things about you. All things that at some point in a relationship with someone they probably need to know about. None of them are (presumably) world-ending, just conversations that need to be had with your partner at some point so they know.
* EDUCATE YOURSELF and talk to your close friends about it and what you're dealing with. This really made all the difference to me. I've been amazed how many people/couples I know have it. Two of my best friends have it (different types and locations too), friends and family have it, and lots of people in my social circles have it. And I had NO. IDEA. Those that are coupled up make it work and they're happy/normal.
* In terms of sex, think of herpes more in the context of having a period (that is contagious, but still). Some women are uncomfortable having sex on a period, so when they are having their period, they communicate to their partner: no sex right now until things are cleared up. Well, same with you now. You feel something funny or think an outbreak is coming? No sex until things clear up.
* Remember that for a lot of people with herpes, this isn't going to have any appreciable effect on your overall health. You are not debilitatingly sick or are going to die from it. You can still live your normal life. You're now dealing with a skin condition that comes and goes. Yes, it can be a pain to deal with. And there are medications that (hopefully) work to help you deal with it. But go live your life.
* This forum has a plethora of opinions and experiences. My general takeaway from it has been (unfortunately) that I was SCREWED now that I have herpes. Having talked with people, my therapist, and friends, I've found that in reality, that's not the case. And I really hope those that are recently diagnosed/dealing with it find some hope in this post that you will, ultimately, be okay.

There's my experience, and I hope it brings you some hope/positivity to your situation. Good luck to y'all out there! Don't let this stop you from living your best life, you definitely still can!",4,40,2022-04-04 14:00:16-04:00,anoth posit disclosur stori lesson learn hsv mid male ghsv bit year share posit stori get gift someon lie take seriou time realli emot heal what occur accept new realiti say herp world ender would prefer sure taint sex life forev chang sexual lepur chang approach date honestli good onto posit disclosur met realli cool ladi mid well person valu amaz look weve click lot level ever sex concern sexual health even went far ask prior kiss oral herp definit mind figur disclos she horrifi leav spent month get know one anoth start sex night final came walk bedroom dread tell fell back map head thought best disclos keep short simpl stay confid explain mean context ask she ever someon who herp see goe convers went someth like hey get talk sexual health real quick sure ive test recent noth came great recent test came back neg well one thing usual dont test awar import your awar genit herp year take suppress medic use condom chanc transfer incred low im outbreak someth id definit let know commun keep protect import ever someon herp convers continu never anyon know alreadi reaction okay good know reaction horrifi gross talk littl happen type risk protect unprotect oralpiv sex experi learn mani peopl know coupl deal experi thu far probabl chat minut answer question could tell whole new world didnt tri make sex happen convers want space think clearli want resum fool around brief interrupt surpris bit felt comfort protect sex yay thing still go great point still use protect sex takeaway hope impart herp isnt end sex life new complic need deal deal commun situat peopl matter need know accept shun disclosur scari ye also great thing tell real quick someon accept reject could reject herp ie realli fear uneduc could reject lukewarm date goe herp make someon who warm move sooner that probabl good thing disclosur dont asham herp dont apolog must acknowledg suck dont apolog honest someon fact confid hard your confid partner feel confid eras bunch concern head ye herp also financi situat emot histori carri thing thing point relationship someon probabl need know none presum worldend convers need partner point know educ talk close friend your deal realli made differ ive amaz mani peoplecoupl know two best friend differ type locat friend famili lot peopl social circl idea coupl make work theyr happynorm term sex think herp context period contagi still women uncomfort sex period period commun partner sex right thing clear well feel someth funni think outbreak come sex thing clear rememb lot peopl herp isnt go appreci effect overal health debilitatingli sick go die still live normal life your deal skin condit come goe ye pain deal medic hope work help deal go live life forum plethora opinion experi gener takeaway unfortun screw herp talk peopl therapist friend ive found realiti that case realli hope recent diagnosedd find hope post ultim okay there experi hope bring hopeposit situat good luck yall dont let stop live best life definit still,"Sentiment(polarity=0.2630686737504919, subjectivity=0.49054735668372035)",0.2630686737504919,positive

twvima,"Can negative test actually be positive? Hi everyone, (23, F) first time posting. 8 days ago i started having a fever and body aches, but I‚Äôve had congestion for about 2 weeks so I attributed it to a sinus infection/allegories. 
5 days ago I noticed a painless lesion on my vulva (1/4 the size of a dime). I immediately went to urgent care and they swabbed me for hsv, chlamydia and gonorrhea. At this time, they said I had ‚Äò2 spots‚Äô (I guess two spots that looked abnormal)
When I got home, I inspected it myself and it looked like mouth ulcers on my vagina. I get mouth ulcers a lot, I think caused by stress and lack of sleep. 4 days ago I got a full panel blood test for all STI‚Äôs. Blood panel was negative for everything - including hsv1 and hsv2 (which makes me think that my mouth ulcers are not hsv 1 related, and that they are in fact related to stress ‚Ä¶. Anyone have experience with this?)
Also, swab was negative for everything - hsv included. I still have the 2 ulcer like lesions that are located at the entrance of my vagina and they hurt. So. Bad. Painful and they burn, literally feel like a mouth ulcer in my genitals and that‚Äôs what it looks like. Kinda has a white coating I guess you could say. Provider from urgent care started me on 1g valtrex twice a day, so I‚Äôve done that consistently for 5 days and my symptoms are not any better (haven‚Äôt had a fever since last week)
The fever threw me off because I‚Äôm like ‚Äúthis has to be hsv, first outbreak) but there is the possibility it could be something unrelated (?)
Back to my main question: what are the possibilities that my swab was negative and blood test was negative and I still am truly positive and having an outbreak?
I had unprotected sex 11 and 16 days ago with the same person (new partner)

the last urgent care i went to tested me for STD‚Äôs. before they gave me my results (took forever) i was finally able to get a dermatologist appt. I was diagnosed with eczema and it happened to develop into a staph infection. i got creams and oral meds. (meds worked wonders!) hours after my appointment my iGg and iGm tests came back positive..

twjt0y,"I'm sure this is herpes but have questions About a week and a half ago after a long road trip I had an itch/tingle in an area around groin and on anus. 
 I then saw 3 or so brownish bumps form thr next day. So these bumps have been there a week with no change. I cant tell if they have fluid. But I do indeed have a tingle, and honestly with that combination of symptoms it would have to be right? No pain or Burning at all yet.

 I went and got STD tested and it said I had no stds.
- I did igg antibody test

However it said for hsv 2 that I had 0.14 on the scale, and only .90 and up is equivocal . So I think it's just not developed antibodies yet. 

I'm positive this is herpes and am getting a swab tomorrow at urgent care.

Questions:
1)I have used monistat today, will that affect my swab result tomorrow?
2)will the swab test on the bumps work if this is my first outbreak and if no fluid is in them? They seem to be just brownish bumps but idk. It is also only 2 weeks since possible exposure and last sexual partner so I wasn't sure if the swab is too early to test.
3)will monistat help with the itch? It seems to have calmed it

She got it from an ex with a mouth cold sore. We talked about it and she told me that her dr told her that her ex didn‚Äôt get it genitally after she had it because he already has Hsv1 orally. So he already has the antibodies or whatever.

So hearing this, I told her that I also get cold sores sometimes on my lips (once or twice a year) and that if she‚Äôs not having a breakout then I would still like to reciprocate if she wanted. I fingered her, used her vibrator on her, but didn‚Äôt eat her out. She also played with her own clit and then fingered me and used her vibrator on me afterwards‚Ä¶

When I go to events and meetings in different state I load up on pills to avoid flare ups redness. Since medication takes 1 hour to work I usually have a small bottle of coverup make up just to avoid people seeing my flare up. This has been very stressful and I have no idea what else I should do.

my gf (21F) and i (21M) got drunk and ended up kissing and then she went down on me and i went down on her a little while after. if i was sober i wouldve NEVER done something to put her in harms way because i love her so much. we did not have sex either.

the entire time i thought i had my suspected cold sore i was lathering it in abreva like 3-4 times a day, and even after the bubble popped and even after the scab fell off i was still lathering it in abreva up until the day i went to go see her.

twc2ed,"Need advice please really appreciate any advice here.... I have never felt so guilty and terrible in my entire life. 

4 years ago, I learned that I have ghsv-1 after having an outbreak.  At the time I was with a long term partner of almost 2 years so we did not use condoms at this point in our relationship. My partner had never experienced any symptoms of genital herpes but did have cold sores on their mouth from time to time as a child. When this happened to me, they told me that they had never had an oral cold sore as an adult. I know with 100% certainty that they were telling the truth about all of this.  They did not disclose to me that they had cold sores as a child but I don't think anyone ever does that so I don't hold them accountable in any way. I've not experienced any symptoms since this initial outbreak. I live a healthy lifestyle and take valtrex daily as a suppressant and according to the doctor if I keep this up I'll probably never experience another outbreak (though I realize it is possible). 

Though friends and research have told me that the initial outbreak can be quite severe, I almost didn't notice the symptoms. I had 3 pinhead sizes sores on my genitals- didn't experience much pain, just minor discomfort. I thought they were ingrown hairs, but I went to the doctor for confirmatory testing to see if I needed treatment. I got a swab test and blood test which both came back positive for HSV-1 and negative for HSV-2. The doctor told me that it was my decision on whether not to disclose my hsv-1 status to new sexual partners and most people do not disclose their hsv-1 because they're either unaware that it can cause genital herpes or due to the fact that the vast majority of people already have hsv-1 as adults (1 in 3 adults is what I was told). I honestly didn't think much of it because I was in a long term committed relationship, so it wasn't a big deal to me at the time. Fast forward 2 years and my partner and I separate amicably. We're still friends and there's no bad blood. 

Now, it's been over a year and a half since we broke up, and I have not had any relationships since then.  I recently met someone who I like- we have kissed and performed oral sex on each other once but have not had penetrative sex.  I did disclose to them that I have the virus hsv-1 that causes oral herpes and I experienced sores in the past, but I did not disclose that I have had an outbreak on my genitals. I feel so incredibly terrible and the guilt is eating me alive. I will never do this again as long as I live- I feel more guilty about this than any bad decision I've ever made.  I really like this person, but we haven't been seeing each other long at all and due to circumstances in both of our lives, I think it's pretty unlikely that we will see each other longterm.  I would like to, but I don't think it will happen even with all of this hsv drama aside. 

What should I do? Disclosing is already scary enough but to disclose to someone that you've kissed & had oral sex with is even worse. I know for a fact that this person will be extremely freaked out if I tell them and they will never want to see me again- which is okay and I feel is completely deserved as I made this horrible decision that could affect their life permanently. Should I just end this relationship and spare them the anxiety of thinking they could possibly have genital herpes or should I tell them the truth and let them end the relationship? I know it's unlikely that I infected them (and most likely that they unknowingly already have hsv-1) so I almost feel like the better thing to do for them might be to not tell them and let them move on free of the stress.  Or should I disclose to them that I was untruthful and they should get tested for HSV-1 now and again a few months down the line to confirm? I made this terrible decision and now have to live with the guilt either way, so I'm asking for advice on what is the best decision to make for this person's well being. I don't need anyone to tell me I'm a horrible person I am because I'm fully aware of that.  I'm also taking into account that, if I have caused this person with a new hsv-1 infection, it's hugely unlikely for them to spread it genitally to any new partners (even if they have it already).

I'm a female with hsv2 and had sex with a male earlier.

I may be having a small outbreak, feeling a bit sore now so I'm freaking out that I have an active OB
To make it worse I ran out of meds a couple weeks ago so..zero protection.
As soon as I realized there wasn't a condom I stopped.
What are the statistical chances of him contracting if I am having an OB? I guess the length of time isn't too important but lets say 5 to 10 minutes of unprotected sex.

tvxdz5,"I am the worst I (22F) have done something terrible to my (25M) partner. So getting right into it, we have been dating for 6 months and gotten pretty serious in our relationship, but the thing is that he didn‚Äôt know I have genital herpes the entire time. So recently, he has broken up with me due to lack of communication, but he has recently contacted me to get back together again to try to work things out. From this point he tells me that he regrets breaking up with me and that it was probably one of the biggest mistakes he‚Äôs ever made. And In midst of talking, I decided that it was best to disclose my status and come clean with all my secrets. 

While in our 6 month relationship I had him use a condom every time we had sex and I was on anti virals. I may also add that when we first got intimate, we had not used a condom. I eventually decided that I was so scared for him catching my virus that I got off of birth control and convinced him to wear a condom to not get pregnant. This was the plan that I had decided to keep my status a secret while protecting him as much as possible. He didn‚Äôt question it and we wore a condom about 90% of the time.

Overall, he had not shown signs of an outbreak and decided that he was going to get tested and research more about herpes before getting back to me. I had told him that herpes hasn‚Äôt affected my life at all and that the initial one was the worst. I basically told him everything about when I got it and how I withheld important information about my status. Ultimately he told me he loves me and we bonded for a really long time but he has to think about my positive status for a bit. He told me he knew it was hard for me and that it doesn‚Äôt change how he feels about me. We are not back together but I really want to get back together with him but I am worried about what he thinks about me basically lying to him. It has been 48 hours since we last spoke and waiting for his answer is honestly killing me and making me feel depressed. I have already come to terms that what I did was definitely wrong and that I have already accepted the decision of him not wanting anything to do with me.

So I am posting on here to basically get some feedback about it all and tell my story to random strangers.

tvu1gx,"Ghsv-1: I might be ok First off: this post is by no means putting down anyone who has hsv-2. I have seen many people become upset by hsv-1 posts that are stating their final comfort with their diagnosis as they realize how they may be able to live with their diagnosis. 

So, I was diagnosed more than half a year ago with GHSV-1. My initial outbreak was possibly the most painful thing I have ever experienced and to add on to it I was extremely ignorant to what HSV really was. I thought that my life was over and that I could never love again. But this is just not true! Statistically GHSV-1 transmits far less often than OHSV-1. Therefore, the question about disclosure is COMPLETELY personal. Take all of the necessary precautions to protect your partner of course, but to disclose this information to them is 100% your choice.

Many medical professionals advise patients that it is not necessary because most of the population has this virus without ever knowing it! 

You may wish to ask for them to be tested for the HSV types but another caution to remember is that the blood tests for this virus are not accurate. 

Be happy, live your life, be safe and if you believe it‚Äôs necessary to disclose then please do! But if you believe that you are taking the necessary precautions to protect your partner then do not feel bad!

tvogla,"Finally confirmed I have hsv 1. Few questions. So I went thru a few tests, first the igm and a
Swab which we‚Äôre both negative. I understand the igm isn‚Äôt accurate but I guess my dr thinks it can tell if it was recently acquired, and he wanted to wait a bit after my OB for the igg. The swab also came back neg but igg pos for hsv1.

Been married for 3 years, and been with my wife for about 6 and very positive she‚Äôs never cheated. But also pretty sure it came from her since I only had sex (with a condom) once before her. 

So here‚Äôs my questions, assuming we both have it. Can it spread now to other places such as the mouth? Whether it‚Äôs during an OB or not? 

As far as we know she‚Äôs never had an OB. Or at least never noticed or associated anything with being something concerning.

Now my other questions, assuming she doesn‚Äôt have it. Should we then be having protected sex? Been not doing that for 6 years now. Should I be on like a suppressant or whatever like my doctor said, if she‚Äôs neg?

He basically said it will be a trickier/more concerning situation if she‚Äôs negative.

tv6iwc,"Disclosed tonight.. I had a great date tonight with a guy I met on Tinder. We have been texting for about a month or more and I‚Äôve been finding reasons to avoid meeting him in person up until tonight bc of my status (GHSV2). 

We had an awesome hangout sesh, went out for dinner and drinks and came back to my house after. I did everything I could to avoid my bedroom, but we both got sleepy and ended up making it there anyway. 

Things got steamy and I had to tell him. He was a little shocked and disappointed, but I told him that I had to let him know before we went any further. He heard me out and listened to what I had to say and didn‚Äôt immediately run away. I told him to ask any questions he might have and that I just wanted to do the right thing and give him the choice. 

I dunno. It was just tough, and I am already expecting to be rejected because of it. He said he wanted to do some research, which I appreciated. I wanted to do the same with my ex GHSV2+ partner. 

I told him whatever he decided was totally fine and that I‚Äôd still be down to hang out and be friends if he chose not to be sexually active with me. That‚Äôs all I can do I guess. 

I‚Äôm not even hoping for a particular outcome because what‚Äôs the point? Whatever happens, happens. Sucks being a decent human being sometimes, but oh well I guess.

tvd7ca,"Free Pamphlet Download - Pay the Support Forward :) Hi everyone!

I put together a pamphlet (with the help of healthcare professionals) full of sex positive resources and outlets for support for people who may be newly finding out about their positive status. It's available on my website for free download! The idea is that we, as a community, print and take small stacks to our own doctor's offices, clinics, OBGYNs, etc to pay the support forward. I remember how lost I felt leaving my drs office and something like this (with real people's faces on it!) would have made a world of difference. 

If you feel so inclined to pay the support forward, the pamphlet can be downloaded for free here: [https://www.devinelisewilson.com/advocacy](https://www.devinelisewilson.com/advocacy)

And if you don't feel like being bothered with printing, there's an option where I'll mail some to you (for a small fee) and all you have to do is drop them off at your next drs appt. 

It takes a village. Let's help others so they don't have to feel as alone as we did.

Much love,

tvn9cl,"Waiting for my herpes test to come back. Waiting is the worst Okay so I‚Äôve never had an issue like this before. I‚Äôm hoping anyone can relate? I‚Äôm waiting on a general STD test and a specific HPV1 and HPV2 test. 

I‚Äôll admit that I‚Äôm not usually safe in the bedroom but I do have an iud. I‚Äôve been with my man since December, haven‚Äôt slept with anyone since my last boyfriend in august-September, slept with 1 guy once last June. Before that I had sex maybe once or twice years ago (one guy was only anal). I‚Äôve never had this issue except that my vag is usually dry- probably because I smoke too much and drink barely any water. 

Last Saturday I noticed a blister on my labia minora after I had some intense oral sex with my boyfriend. He forgot to shave and he gets a little carried away sometimes. He‚Äôll go for hours in many different positions unless I signal him to stop. So after the deed I was burning a bit. In the next few days I was really dry and uncomfortable (probably because he often sucks all the moisture out of my body lol). I looked on Wednesday and saw a red sore mark that I think is from him. 

Because I‚Äôm not smart, I tried to get rid of the terrible burning and applied some unscented lotion to my labia. I went to work all day and it was burning. I washed it off at home and I felt a little better. But I went to the doctor and she said I had lots of swelling and blistering. She diagnosed me with a UTI. 

Starting Thursday I started to get blisters and bumps all over my labia majora, some on my labia minora, and more near the perineum. It looks like there‚Äôs a burn/injury below the vaginal opening/perineum area. It‚Äôs super dry, irritated, swollen, and it hurts so much when I pee or move around. I feel more fine laying down but once I move around I get so itchy that I have to sit in the bathtub. It looks like a few of them scabbed over or are red irritated (like when you scratch the scab off an injury). I think I was scratching in my sleep. 

It‚Äôs not too itchy but it‚Äôs mostly burning. Discharge is kinda clear but doesn‚Äôt smell. There‚Äôs not much discharge either. I had a 100 temp yesterday but that‚Äôs it, no sickness signs or high temp now, it‚Äôs just the irritated bumps I have. 

An online doc said it could be dermatitis or inflammation. So I went to a final doctor at Walgreens today. She looked and said she really thinks it‚Äôs herpes. She gave me antivirals and took a blood test. Now I‚Äôm so worried its herpes but the bumps don‚Äôt look pus filled and they‚Äôre not bursting? Like they look like a really bad reaction to the lotion but now I‚Äôm worried? I really hope it‚Äôs not herpes and I‚Äôm going crazy over here. 

I‚Äôm kinda concerned about the skin the surrounding the clit? It‚Äôs swollen skin that forms a fold next to where the clit is, kinda looks like I have a second vagina in that area. There‚Äôs a bit of skin there that‚Äôs swollen and bulges out a bit. I think I have a painful pimple on the swollen bit because it‚Äôs a sharp sting when anything brushes on it. 

Baths are the only thing that help and they work for about an hour after getting out. 

It could be herpes, I think I‚Äôm just trying to reassure myself that it isn‚Äôt. Any advice? I can post a picture I just thought it could be weird to post a pic of my lady garden.

Edit: the bumps appeared the day of/the next morning after the lotion. Before that I was so dry and the red labia mark was hurting because it would rub against my skin and the friction hurt.

tvc4n1,"Diagnosed this week, having horrible first outbreak Hi everyone. I‚Äôm 23F and diagnosed with HSV1 this week. On Monday, had sex with a new partner for the first time. No protection (which I‚Äôll forever be kicking myself for) and no warning signs, although it was dark. Thought I just had soreness from sex but by the time Thursday night hit the pain while peeing had gotten horrible and was only getting worse. Got swabbed and came back positive. 

A little strange because my symptoms are genital, but I have type 1 and he didn‚Äôt go down on me at all. Still haven‚Äôt confronted him about this to see if he knew. 

Overall, I‚Äôm accepting the individual aspects (although the pain right now fucking sucks) but I‚Äôm really devastated about having to disclose for the rest of my life. Does anyone have any tips on how to go about it? I like having casual sex (no surprise, kinda how I ended up here) and would never want to mislead someone by not disclosing, but am struggling with how to tell people that I‚Äôm not seeking a relationship with. 

Any advice about how you disclose, stats on transmission when not in OB and using protection, and just any advice on how to get through this first OB would be much appreciated.

I just recently got out of the military and moved to a new town. My spouse is far away and I have only been away from her for 2 months. Now in this new city I moved into a house where I had roommates, 1 female and 1 male. The male is irrelevant in this story, fuck him.. now the female and I were very compatible from day one, being she was is in the military too. Naturally we hung out a lot as friends , nothing more strictly platonic . That was my first mistake, and I am very aware of that. We started hanging out a lot, grabbing food , going stargazing things of that nature just vibin. Now one evening she invites me out to a club and I decide to go , I got super wasted . Shit, WE got super wasted. We went home and she asked me to sleep in my room (she lives downstairs we were in no condition to walk down any stairs) naturally I said of course , ‚ÄúI‚Äôll sleep on the bean bag no big deal, you sleep on my bed‚Äù or something along those lines. Fast forward like 4 hrs and I get super uncomfortable because of some injuries I have and lord and behold I moved to my amazing soft temperpedic bed (love that thing) only problem is she was on it and I guess she took this as her invitation to have sex with me? Idk I‚Äôm also at fault because I didn‚Äôt stop her (sober me would‚Äôve, but drunk me is an asshole) now fast forward a month I start itching and getting a OB in my mouth and genitals so it prompts me to get checked turns out I have hsv 1/2 so I tell her to get herself checked and turns out she‚Äôs asymptomatic. At first I was super mad but I didn‚Äôt take my frustration out on her and I composed myself in her presence because when she found out she was just as surprised as me and she felt super bad for giving me it blah blah blah . I‚Äôve been super nice to her but I‚Äôm at a difficult cross road. My wife is very well aware of everything I was honest and transparent with her sparing no details . She has accepted that things are different and has since moved on . Now I‚Äôm worried we won‚Äôt ever be able to have kids . I do not want to infect her and I want kids, she also wants kids of her own . Everything I have read states that I should refrain from having unprotected sex so I have no idea what to do, I love my spouse too much to change her life in that manner .

It's mostly been tolerable until maybe a couple weeks ago, but recently it's been waking me up in the middle of the night. Hot water (like, almost burning) reduces the itching. As does soap. But again that's until night time or until i take a poop.

tux7wy,"I can not mentally cope with herpes anymore It has been a year since I got my results amd I think I have came to the point I can notcope anymore. I dont understand why I am making this as nothing can help me feel better as I have spent the last year thinking about it constantly.

Sometimes I truly hate this sub reddit as I read that I have to disclose yet everyone else gets a free pass since they listened to their doctors or did not test or just had no symptoms like me. They get to live a normal happy care free life but because I got tested and came on this reddit my life is over 

My biggest regret in life was getting a blood test when my doctor advised me not too. I already suffer from severe mental health and this result has just devasted me beyond the point off return. I am 22, average looking or maybe above average with a crap job and bad mental health. My options for hooking up or relationships are already a struggle but with herpes they are basically done. I know people say on here womwn do not care but they do. It is one of the reasons why everyobe says you most disclose, it is their way of saying if they had known they would not have slept with that person. If you check anywhere online that is not a herpes sub reddit etc you will see a veey large amount of the population would not take the risk.

This peaves me with a few options

Go through life with no hook ups or the ability to find love 

Tell people and get rejected almoat every tine, have the information spread to my social circle and have my mental health and confidence take hit after hit for the rest of my life until I breakdown. And then with the tiny chance I meet someone I love who accepts me I have to live with the fear for the rest of our relationship I will infect her and ruin her life like mine and so will she.  Oral sex will always be seem as a huge risk so that will be basically off the table.

So all I can say at this point is if my options are being alone and miserable or many, many rejections and then spend the rest of my life fearing I will pass it on and then the mental turmoil if I do.

No more possibility of meeting a mysterious woman at a bar and heading back to a hotel for a passionate night, no more stress free relationships without the constant fear of passing on a non curable disease. All these things are gone from my life because of this damn disease so I will be going through life like a zombie.",40,7,2022-04-02 20:14:51-04:00,mental cope herp anymor year sinc got result amd think came point notcop anymor dont understand make noth help feel good spent last year think constantli sometim truli hate sub reddit read disclos yet everyon els get free pass sinc listen doctor test symptom like get live normal happi care free life got test came reddit life big regret life get blood test doctor advis alreadi suffer sever mental health result devast beyond point return averag look mayb averag crap job bad mental health option hook relationship alreadi struggl herp basic done know peopl say womwn care one reason everyob say disclos way say known would slept person check anywher onlin herp sub reddit etc see veey larg amount popul would take risk peav option go life hook up abil find love tell peopl get reject almoat everi tine inform spread social circl mental health confid take hit hit rest life breakdown tini chanc meet someon love accept live fear rest relationship infect ruin life like mine oral sex alway seem huge risk basic tabl say point option alon miser mani mani reject spend rest life fear pass mental turmoil possibl meet mysteri woman bar head back hotel passion night stress free relationship without constant fear pass non curabl diseas thing gone life damn diseas go life like zombi,"Sentiment(polarity=0.03292540792540794, subjectivity=0.4243589743589744)",0.03292540792540794,nuetral

tv0lua,"Awaiting results So here's my story, and I'm wondering if I can get advice on what everyone thinks. 

I noticed a red lump on my bikini line near my vagina. At first I just thought ingrown hair, but after a week it hadn't gone away. It wasn't overly painful, and didn't change in size/appearance. It hasn't blistered or anything, it's uncomfortable but not painful. 
I sent pics to my ex (still friends) who's thinks ingrown hair. We were together for 7 months having unprotected sex, and he never had any symptoms or anything. 

I went and saw a nurse who said it could be herpes, but it didn't look like it. But she also didn't think it looked like an ingrown hair either. She swabbed it and I get results back tomorrow. She said because it's not an open sore she might not even be able to get enough sample to pick up an infection. 
I already have HSV1 because I get cold sores on my lips occasionally, so she said if it's positive it will most likely be HSV1 on my genitals, which is nothing to worry about, and I'll probably never get another sore again. She said you don't even need to disclose to sexual partners - which doesn't seem right to me but anyway. 

Now I've been SO stressed out about this. The guy I just started seeing told me if it's positive that it's a deal breaker, which has totally crushed me. 
I guess I'm just wondering if anyone gets symptoms like that? Doesn't really look like herpes, it's a red bump, kind of looks like a blister but it has absolutely nothing in it. Isn't changing size or anything.

I‚Äôve been feeling at my lowest for a while now and finally managed to pluck up the courage to get back out there again. 

God know why but I went back on tinder. I decided to drop the HSV code at the bottom of my profile. Figured it would save me some time and potential confidence knocks. 

I matched with a girl I met on tinder and dated over 10 years ago. We hit it off instantly and arranged to meet later that day. 

The date was great, we seemed really similar in terms of growth we had both done. Things were intense but I rolled with it. 

We got pretty drunk. She said she wanted to take me back to hers, I was down but I said I wanted to take it slow. I didn‚Äôt want to have to explain right there and I also didn‚Äôt want to just jump in to another relationship base on fucking again. She agreed

We got back to hers, I chilled on her bed while she went to the bathroom. She busted straight in the room in just her underwear and jumped straight on me and told me to fuck her, no protection. 

I said I just wanted to chill so she told me to just cuddle her but kept pushing for it. 

I felt like I had to say something. I started explaining, yeah maybe not in the clearest way because it‚Äôs the first disclosure for me. I‚Äôve never seen someone move so fast, jumping off me and saying ‚ÄúEWWW YOUVE GOT AN STD!‚Äù  

Obviously I didn‚Äôt take that reaction well so I just left.

No prodrome signs, only slight irritation on the spot when rubbed against underwear, no painful urination, no blisters (that I‚Äôve seen).

The entire mentality of people saying to disclose is they are saying if they were given the choice they would not have slept with that person and got herpes in the first place. If you are just a normal guy wave goodbye to casual sex.

On top of that with so many people having it and almost 80% being oblivious to having it or not caribg to disclose why do I have to ruin my life just because I went out of my way to get a blood test?

tulz87,"Newly HSV-2 diagnosis and I have some questions? I have recently taken an IgG blood test with the results coming back negative for Hsv1, but with a range of 9+ for Hsv2. Outside of trying to cope with the obstacles that may come with my sex life, I‚Äôm also curious about OB? So far all I‚Äôve had is tingling that ranges from my lower back to my feet (and sometimes my hands, not sure if that matters). They‚Äôre not painful at all, it‚Äôs kind of similar to pins and needles, but my main concern is if/when the lesions and blisters will come. I was speaking to my doctor about it and she labeled me as asymptomatic despite me mentioning the tingling. With that being said, she refused to prescribe me antivirals because there are no clear visible signs of an outbreak. 

So my questions are:

1. Tingling sensations are my main symptoms at this point in time, is there are possibility of blisters and lesions? When?

2. Is tingling a sign of asymptomatic viral shedding? (Does it actually look like shedding skin??)

3. Would being prescribed daily antivirals be the best way to prevent transmission and decrease shedding?

A couple days ago, I began to develop what looks like a more typical cold sore on my upper lip. Very tingly.

See pics in comment

Sun 3/20
Shaved genitals in shower used a razor 

Tues am 3/22
Morning sex with gf but felt like something was weird on base of shaft. It was dark and after sex I went to work. 

Later that day at work I go to the bathroom and see two scabs at base of penis.

Freaking out I text my gf and she says prob ingrown hairs.

I am in no pain they are not even sensitive really. 

Wed 3/23
I ask gf to pluck the ingrown hairs. This brings on some discomfort. 

Thur 3/24 
Still healing etc, I have zero pain or irritation. I work in cultivation so I‚Äôm sweating and walking/running/squating etc‚Ä¶ and no pain in that area.

Getting impatient I put some zit cream on it hoping it would help prob a dumb idea.

Fri 3/25
I‚Äôm still scabbing. My gf and I drink and end up having sex for awhile. As the sex goes on I kind of ignore some of the irritation, it doesn‚Äôt hurt but I def know scabs are there.

Sat 3/26
Very similar day just no sex. No pain or anything. 

Sun 3/27
Here‚Äôs where things go bad, I put neosporin on the two ingrown hairs in the am. Later around 5pm I notice a small pimple forming in between the two ingrown hairs where I had slathered the neosporin. 

Mon 3/28
Wake up, go to work. Nothing different no pain or irritation as I‚Äôm getting dressed. I didn‚Äôt look cause it‚Äôs very early. However when I got to work I checked it out hoping the ingrown hairs would be healing but now I see like 3 blisters and the skin is all red and raised. I begin freaking out so much so my boss says I look sick and should go home. 

I instantly do research on neosporin and see I could be allergic. Try to relax, I put some hydrocortisone on to see if it would alleviate.

At this point in time I have felt almost 0 pain or discomfort through this situation.

Tues 3/29
Now there are a few small red spots on penis head with no pain or irritation and I‚Äôm starting to freak out thinking i have herpes.

Skip to Thursday 3/31
I go to work, it‚Äôs a busy day I swear a lot and alll of a sudden I start getting burning like sensations over the ingrown hair and now blustery rash. 

I go buy some lotrimin af and apply and it relieves all burning sensation
(hydrocortisone seemed to not be doing anything) 

Friday 4/1
Applied lotrimin two times and only felt the mild burning once.

Sat 4/2
Applied lotrimin and I feel fine right now. Things look to be healing.

I didn‚Äôt have any flu like symptoms, I had some hot cold flashes from stress (my mind is hard to contain once I get a thought going and I‚Äôm quite the hypochondriac) 

I have a bad relationship with doctors as I feel they kind of treat me like a number which is why I haven‚Äôt gone in yet. I‚Äôm going to try the lotrimin for another week and if it doesn‚Äôt help I will be going in to the doc. 

Posting here to see if I can get any advice or if anybody has gone through this.

It‚Äôs just weird if it is hsv that I didn‚Äôt have any pain until after the neosporin. Leads me to believe contact dermatitis.  

Thanks for any help/advice or just reading

Lss:
2 Ingrown hairs found
Plucked one next day
Acne cream 3 days later
Neosporin after that
Blister show up morning after applying neosporin
They have popped etc‚Ä¶ scabbed 
No pain through all of this
Then spots appear on penis head(no pain or irritation there)
Get lotrimin af which helps the burn/stinging sensation that is only noticeable around base and testicles 
No other symptoms besides my mind making me think too much. No burning while urinating. No swollen glands.

tula0z,"New to this... Need some help. Not in a good place. (This was posted in the ColdSores Reddit as well, incase anyone sees it there.)

I'm sure many, many of you have been in the same position I'm in right now. I have several different things going on that I need some advice on. I'll try not to make this too long. 

Over the years, I've had a habit of biting/chewing/scraping my teeth on my lips. Sometimes I'd look like I had a cut on my lip because I seemed to focus on the same lower left spot. I thought nothing of it. I've known people who get cold sores, and thought nothing of that as well. Last Friday or Saturday (Or so), I woke up with what appeared to be just a zit right in that same lower left spot. My skin hasn't been great lately so that was the first thing that was same to assume. I've been under severe stress with some other health issues going on/my job/personal issues. The ""zit"" eventually looked like a scab. There was no pain and no warning sign such as tingling (I'm aware that cold sores often don't have warnings ahead of time). Its been about a week and it just looks like 2 small cuts now but the marks still aren't gone. I had to go to my doctor on Wednesday for some other things, and I had to address the elephant in the room. She said it looked like a ""fever blister"" and we know what that is. She took a swab of it and said she'd call me with the results, which I still haven't received. I got extremely emotional during it and she seemed reassuring, even though doctors aren't there to be your friend. She said many, many people have these and the only alternative is to never kiss/be romantic/affectionate ETC with anyone ever again, which isn't realistic. I've gone down rabbit hole after rabbit hole online about them, which usually doesn't help someone in my position. But from what I've read, many people have them and never know, so they give them to other people. I'm terrified of doing that to someone else, or even giving it to them down below, if that's what it turns out to be. I obviously would never kiss or go down on someone with this on my mouth. Here are two issues I'm facing right now. 

&#x200B;

I'm scared to even hug anyone in the event I may give them something, and I'm washing my hands more than ever before. I'm scared to even touch certain things throughout the house, touch my face, and I wonder if it's lingering on anything I drink from/different areas of my skin. The anxiety and fear is keeping me up at night about giving it to yourself down below. My doctor said that's possible, but unlikely. The problem now is that I've been feeling some itching and irritation down there, but that time of the month is also just ending and I started using a new soap this week. Every little feeling I get down there causes me anxiety and I keep checking the area many times a day to see if there's a sore/blister forming. There's nothing on me down there, physically, but I'm scared to death to touch the area without scrubbing my hands first, and I'm afraid I've already done the damage without realizing, either from using the bathroom or showering. If that happens, I feel like my life is over and I'll never be desirable to anyone ever again. Who would believe a story that you did it to yourself? I already feel that way IF this is a fever blister/cold sore, which I think it is. Anyone I date is going to have to know. My uncle whose passed away had them, it's possible he could have kissed me on the cheek years ago and given it to me, or someone I was dating/in a relationship with. There's just no way to know. A friend seems to think the ""sensation"" I'm feeling down there is all mental, because I've been thinking about it and reading so much. She doesn't think I spread it to myself and I surely hope she's right. 

&#x200B;

Here's another issue. I just started seeing someone that I really like and we've hit it off really well. We're both over 30 and want the same things. I'm not into the casual life and always preferred to be committed to someone. I have casually dated over the years, but that just seems to be the name of the game in today's day and age. You have to date around before you find what you're looking for. We also don't live in a culture that focuses on forming relationships, more so being casual and ""having fun."" He and I went to a bar a night or two before this ""zit"" appeared. I did take a sip of his drink, which he was fine with. We also kissed later in the night. Nothing was on my face at this time and I obviously had no idea that something was going to appear. If it's HSV 1, I obviously have to tell him. I'm terrified to, but I know it's the right thing to do. I truly feel that this person likes me for me, it's like we've known each other for years already, and I'm scared to lose this relationship that's been a breath of fresh air. We spend anywhere from 1-3 hours on the phone on a daily basis. We've talked about our health issues, but I haven't revealed any of this yet. My doctor said that I don't have to say anything as of yet. I feel like maybe he'll think differently of me or won't want to see me anymore. I'm afraid of giving him something down below, even if nothing is on my mouth, or him giving it to me if he gets it on his mouth from me. I was just seeing another person for 6 months up until September. Prior to that, I hadn't had sex in 2 years. Me and this person eventually weren't using condoms because I was on BC. I understand that probably wasn't the best idea, but we were sleeping together regularly. He revealed to me later in the relationship that I wasn't the only person that he was seeing/sleeping with. He also told me he had been with over 200 women. My number is nowhere close to that. I obviously could have picked something up from him and I even had a conversation with him that things can spread between people. I'm not blaming him, but it's a possibility, like many others.

tufm0i,"No index value on my (positive) herpes type 2 IGG test result report Last week, I went to a gynocologist about some symptoms I was having. I suspected that I had a UTI and possibly something else due to an itching sensation inside my vagina, especially when I pee.

I talked to my gynocologist about my sexual history and we decided to do a full STD and STI screening on me.

I am a heterosexual female and have only ever given and received oral sex and have been fingered, but I have never had intercourse. I pointed out some pimple like bumps on the right side of my vagina, but my gynecologist didn't seem alarmed and said that they are probably just razor bumps. My gynecologist almost decided to not do a blood test on me because I have never had intercourse and the bumps on my vagina did not appear to be herpes to her, but I pressed for a blood test anyway seeing as I have had 3 sexual partners.

My test results for everything came back negative except for HSV-2 (Type 2 herpes/genital herpes.) I noticed, however, that my report does not have an index value on it. It just says ""HSV-2 Normal: Positive"" ""Reference: Negative"" but there is not an index value on there.

I am also wondering if this could be a false positive seeing as my gynecologist almost did not see a reason to blood test me even after seeing the bumps on my vagina and hearing about my sexual history.

I am going to talk to my doctor about my test results and see what she thinks. If it turns out that I have a low index value, does this mean that I most likely do not have type 2 herpes?

Also, the bumps on my vagina have remained the same size, color, shape, and feeling for over 3 weeks now. I am starting to doubt that it is genital herpes. I also have never had any outbreak symptoms to the best of my knowledge. No fever or flu like symptoms following a sexual encounter, no burning and the bumps on my vagina are not painful.

tu6mrv,"I was just diagnosed with HSV2 I have some pretty quick questions!

Explanation of my situation:

I had my first outbreak about 8 months ago. Because of the location, on my butt, I thought it was just my eczema. So I didn't get it checked out and it healed fairly quickly. I didn't think much of it until the rash showed up again a few days ago. I decided to get it checked out and it turns out to be HSV-2.

I have cried a lot, had my fair share of panic attacks and been ready to give up in the past few days. But I have finally accepted that I have it and theres nothing to change that.

But here are some problems I am currently facing: 

1. I wanna tell the person who gave it to me(?)/who ive have been sleeping with, I'm just not sure how to do it with out blaming him. I wanna do it in a calm manner. Do you have any tips?

2. My doctor is refusing me daily antivirals because I haven't had 6 outbreaks in a year. (Looking back I've probably had 3, including this one.) I saw that there was an online perception website called felixforyou.ca I wanted to know if any of you have used it or heard about it? I just wanna reduce my amount of shedding and have safety in knowing I'm less likely to give it to a partner.

ttrcf6,"How do I have casual sex? Just got a positive result for HSV2. Doing a lot of browsing on forums and trying to make myself feel ok.

My biggest thing is that I know I personally can come to terms with this. But I dont know how in the world to tell sexual partners.

I have a fair amount of casual sex and really enjoy being intimate. I dont see how I could do that now or have a conversation with a guy in a bar before going home with them.

Ive read that most people have it and many dont care. If thats the case then why (in all my excapades) has nobody disclosed that to me!

I dont know how Ill date.

ttr3gy,"Every doctor I've spoken to says I don't need to disclose GHSV1 I've had GHSV1 for several years, I got it like many do, getting oral sex from a partner who had asymptomatic OHSV1.

I had an initial outbreak, then thankfully nothing since. From what I've read, since I haven't had another outbreak in many years I probably won't ever get another one. So if I use condoms for penetrative sex, the risk of transmission is low. 

I've spoke to several doctors, both men and women, as well as nurses at sexual health clinics about GHSV1. They all say the same thing: it's very common, you don't need to disclose you have HSV1. But ultimately, they add the disclaimer ""but whether you do is up to you""

It's a tough situation and there's many posts on this subreddit about it. 

For the first year or so, my approach was to be sexually active with a new partner and not disclose until the discussion of going on the contraceptive pill and not using condoms came up. It was the chance to say ""since we're considering not using condoms...""

In the last few years, I've disclosed to new partners before we had sex. The results are probably 60/40 in favour of it being well received, but the 40% are doozys. One partner in that category said she'd continue to be with me if I wore a condom for oral sex ongoing, even when we were in a committed monogamous long term relationship. Another agreed to take the risk if we were in a relationship, but a month or so later broke up with me and admitted she had the risk in the back of her head every time we slept together and it was part of the reason we broke up.

Recently I got an STI check as I do as a sexually active person, and I took the opportunity to speak to the sexual health clinic nurse. I asked her what her thoughts are on disclosure of HSV1, as I had started dating a new woman who I'd like to be with. She took me by surpise in how casual her response was - she basically said 75% of the population has HSV1, people with OHSV1 don't disclose before kissing, so it's not needed if you have GHSV1. She said the risk was low, it was more a matter of what I could live with on my conscience. 

This recent discussion has thrown me a bit. Like I say, I've been disclosing for the last few years. But I really really want it to work out with the latest person I'm dating, and I fear the worst outcome that this is a deal breaker for her, despite how low the risk of transmission is. 

The thing that's drawing me back towards still disclosing, despite the go-ahead to not from medical professionals, is that I want a long term relationship with this new person, and the truth would probably come out eventually in one of two ways which would be worse than being rejected:

1. Eventually I give her herpes, she then has an outbreak many months or more into our relationship and quite rightly asks 'WTF?!' and I'm possibly accused to cheating or something, then I either have to play dumb and lie to her or confess I have had GHSV1 all along - it would either be me creating a huge deception to someone I'm meant to love and care for, or probably end in breakup from the betrayal
2. When we try and get pregnant and have children, I'd have to confess then anyway to a doctor so that they knew to monitor for any signs of neo-natal herpes. 

Have you ever been told its fine to not disclose from your doctor or a nurse? Have you ever decided to take that advice when with a new partner who you wanted to be long term with? Or have you dismissed it and disclosed anyway? 

I'd appreciate any thoughts on this and to hear your experiences.",5,5,2022-04-01 09:47:46-04:00,everi doctor ive spoken say dont need disclos ghsv ive ghsv sever year got like mani get oral sex partner asymptomat ohsv initi outbreak thank noth sinc ive read sinc havent anoth outbreak mani year probabl wont ever get anoth one use condom penetr sex risk transmiss low ive spoke sever doctor men women well nurs sexual health clinic ghsv say thing common dont need disclos hsv ultim add disclaim whether tough situat there mani post subreddit first year approach sexual activ new partner disclos discuss go contracept pill use condom came chanc say sinc consid use condom last year ive disclos new partner sex result probabl favour well receiv doozi one partner categori said shed continu wore condom oral sex ongo even commit monogam long term relationship anoth agre take risk relationship month late broke admit risk back head everi time slept togeth part reason broke recent got sti check sexual activ person took opportun speak sexual health clinic nurs ask thought disclosur hsv start date new woman id like took surpis casual respons basic said popul hsv peopl ohsv dont disclos kiss need ghsv said risk low matter could live conscienc recent discuss thrown bit like say ive disclos last year realli realli want work late person im date fear bad outcom deal breaker despit low risk transmiss thing that draw back toward still disclos despit goahead medic profession want long term relationship new person truth would probabl come eventu one two way would wors reject eventu give herp outbreak mani month relationship quit rightli ask wtf im possibl accus cheat someth either play dumb lie confess ghsv along would either creat huge decept someon im meant love care probabl end breakup betray tri get pregnant children id confess anyway doctor knew monitor sign neonat herp ever told fine disclos doctor nurs ever decid take advic new partner want long term dismiss disclos anyway id appreci thought hear experi,"Sentiment(polarity=0.03345258136924803, subjectivity=0.482344276094276)",0.03345258136924803,nuetral

ttt0gf,"Any experience with swelling/lumps in the taint? [Long]

Hello friends! Just want to preface this post by saying that the question I'm asking I don't think is particularly related to my diagnosis - I just figure that we talk about our genitals a lot in here with what has seemed to me like very little judgement, so I was hoping to possible get some other accounts of what I am experiencing to help me determine how much to worry. If this post is irrelevant/needs to be taken down, that's totally understandable.

I am 26F and was diagnosed with genital HSV1 about a year and a half ago. I almost immediately got on daily suppressant medication thanks to the help and direction of some of the community members here, and I haven't had a problem since my initial outbreak. I will say that for a few years I have off and on struggled with what I believe to be hemorrhoids for a number of unconcerning reasons. Since I figured out what was going on with that aspect of my downstairs, I have always just kept overnight suppositories and witch hazel in my bathroom for when it gets uncomfortable, and I can usually get them to clear up in a day or two. But I have noticed that I have struggled with them more frequently since my diagnosis, which I just chalked up to my body knowing that there's a lot going on down there (being a female who has HSv1, suppresses it with medication, menstruates and has sex), and that it is my body's way of showing signs of stress as needed. Nothing I haven't been able to handle so far.

... This week, however, has been a bit disgruntling. I am just going to lay out all of the facts and see (hope) that someone can tell me that they can relate and that hopefully it's not that crazy big of a deal. I did have sex for the first time in a long time with a new partner a week ago today, nothing crazy or intense, pretty straightforward. By I would say Wednesday, I noticed that my taint/general anal area was getting a little swollen and itchy. This is common for me with hemorrhoids, and the itching is also common when I shave down there for the first time in a while, so I didn't think too much about it. I applied witch hazel before I went to bed which soothed the itching. Woke up yesterday and checked myself out, itching had increased again and my taint was viably more swollen. Now instead of being a general fleshy swell, I had a small bead within the swelling that I could feel with a finger and almost push around a little bit. Not so much pain, and not even visually alarming to look at - no redness, external bumps, etc. Just noticably swollen flesh that stretches from the bottom of my vaginal opening to what looked like a protrusion from my anus.

I figured it still had something to do with hemorrhoids and was just being tricky. I used a suppository last night and woke up to relief from swelling in/around my actual anus, but now a hard lump in my taint that is probably double the size of a pea. Still no pain, just irritation that feels like it's from being trapped between my legs all night. Still no redness or external bumps, just a very noticable extension/swelling of flesh that shouldn't be there.

Long story short, I have spent all morning googling this to see if I need to make a trip to urgent care after work (which is how I got my diagnosis for HSV1). I have been reading about cysts and abscesses to no avail, but what confuses me is that there is no pain/leakage. I have been a little nervous about having a bowel movement so I have admittedly not attempted that yet, I'm just saying that other than the forming lump under my skin and the itching, nothing seems or feels wrong.

ttqs5k,"Help Me Understand the Risk with HSV-1 and (cis) lesbian sex...? Hi all, 

First of all, I just want to say I think it's really cool this forum exists and, personally, I wish herpes didn't have the stupid amount of stigma around it that it does. I personally have never had an oral or genital herpes outbreak (weirdly except for a year-long case of genital molluscum contagiosum, which is also in the family!! But it's still pretty different.) 

I do have some questions, however.  I've just begun dating a woman who I've known for a few months as friends first, we have a wonderful relationship already and I'm really excited to start...having sex with her. LOL. However, she has already disclosed the GHSV-1 she contracted from oral to genital contact a few years ago. That makes sense to me, I've known others with that same story, etc.  

But here's what I'm trying to understand as far as my own ""risk.""   
I'm also a woman. We're lesbians.  Assuming that...we have sex in a manner in which the only ""membrane"" contact is my mouth to her vulva...what kind of reasonable/approximate risk for transmission am I looking at? Am I going to get ORAL HSV-1 from that? And, even if we took turns topping each other, without direct \*scissoring\* or, you know, something similar, I'm still just not sure **how I would get genital HSV-1 from us mutually going down on each other and/or using our hands for penetration.** 

I feel dumb saying this because when I responded to her disclosure with the attitude of like ""ok...thanks for telling me, but like...who cares and how could I possibly get it from you??"" she laughed and acted like I didn't understand something...but she also didn't ...provide a convincing explanation, either.

ttu43q,"5 years ago I found out Firstly I don't know if this is the right place to ask but. 

Five years ago I found out I had herpes (21 M at the time, I got it roughly when I was 14/15 from my first time) it dawned on me the moment I found out and my previous years flashed before my eyes all the times people had jokingly but seriously pointed out the fact I did. Being younger I never took it seriously thought it was just joking with each other. 

After which I really shut down and got quite depressed on the whole *for life* scenario I've just discovered. Once I got over this hump roughly two years I wasn't the same. I really secluded myself from any sexual interact and pursued any relationship because of this to the point where I find flirting to an extent wrong incase it lead to something more and the awkwardness/potential rejection I'll be faced with if it came to it.

This has really taken a tole on my life. It stunted my confidence and my personality, whether it be with girls or just general friends who either ask to share my food or point out the marks I have in my elbow which I tend to deflect. I don't have the confidence to openly tell someone of my situation, so I chose the path of just shutting down from any future intimate relationships. And not giving myself the chance to find anything because of this choice. 

I'm now struggling for answers and seek advice on how I go about my situation. Do I really just tell every girl I create a relationship with that id like go further I have herpes. I don't even know how to ask someone on a date anymore because I feel I should tell them beforehand.

ttlemt,"Just finding out I have herpes rant This is going to be long.  I am just gonna let everything.

In January I found out I was pregnant by someone I was dealing with casually. The next day I found out my little sister died from covid from my parents. From that day I decide I didn't want to keep it. Ask for ASAP abortion, so I had time to go to my sister's funeral. I regret not getting a sti screening when I had my appointment. Neither did I do a scan because I didn't want to see.  I was 3 weeks preggo.

Now after that I was not having sex with anymore from the month of January. When I was comfortable having sex again. I went back to a new (old) sexual partner 2 years ago. We had sex for the first I believe time on the last week on February 21. The next week on March I started to experience symptoms. At first I thought it was a bad UTI. I thought he was sleeping around and gave me uti. So I went my doctors gave me some thrush cream and told me it should improve and test my urine for bacteria as well as a clap and gonorrhoea. The doctors called me and said I'm positive for clap so I told him. He took to well. This guy is a dramatic little bitch. So when I started talking about it nobody fault i knew it was from him. But after i took my medication my symptoms didn't improve they got worse.

My  vagina and my ass was itching, I had a mad discharge, my urethra was swollen and red. I had to wear pads for the discharge and paracetamol for the pain. There was one point where i couldn't even walk properly.  I thought i had sex too early from my abortion and got an infection or something. Then i started to get bumps on my vulva. I called the sexual health clinic and asked for an emergency appointment.  The nurse told me my bumps didn't look like herpes and made me optimistic about. I would hear my results in the next week.

I found out two days ago that i had it. The day i found out I was at work and had to leave because i couldn't stop crying. I felt like shit, I was having crazy thoughts. too many things have happened to me in the space of 3 months and i feel like i have hit rock bottom. I feel like this guy has given to me. 

I had my first 'out' break after we had sex. and if always had the stress of me being pregnant and losing my sister would cause me to flare up

No possible way and he is in denial saying that he doesn't have it and i must of gotten it from somewhere else. I'm here telling him i haven't had sex with anyone else.  How could I catch genital herpes in a space of a week with someone else when i haven't been doing anything???

i  have contacted all my pass sexual partners in the last 3 months and told them. One took it quite well maturely. The one i got pregnant for called me a tramp to someone else and told them to tell me?

i just wanna know if i have always had it or it's a thing where this one guy gave to me? it feels like my life it over. Sex is out the window i don't have it.  i don't wanna risk anyone else. I don't want to even disclose to any other person that i have it.

ttc451,"Waiting 3 months for an accurate diagnosis is quite the trip. It‚Äôs crazy how much of a roller coaster I‚Äôve had with this shit.  2 negative tests. Yet has a doctor look at a small irritated spot and seemed sure it was herpes. 

Went from thinking it was something else. To being absolutely certain it was hsv. Multiple times. Came to terms with it. Got hope again. It‚Äôs been fuckin crazy honestly. I can see why some doctors discourage testing at all with out clear symptoms. It‚Äôs crazy. 

I‚Äôve hit a point where I realized I just need to change as a person. Adapt to a point where my mind can handle this diagnosis.  I have to reshape things. Be less desperate for love and sex and learn to enjoy the many other sides of life that I have been neglecting. 

I have to wait 4 more weeks. I‚Äôm tempted to get tested again at 7weeks mark. Was negative at 5 weeks. 

Have had mild but noticeable symptoms through out this time.  Mostly little stinging feelings in areas all around my thighs. I just can‚Äôt believe how much time I‚Äôve spent obsessing about it. Looking at numbers. Looking at transmission rates. Going over my encounter 100 times in detail to think of what contact I had. It‚Äôs just crazy that just 50 years ago this shit would be a whole different experience.  Like is this healthy?  Is this a way to live. 

I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. Part of me thinks I should just learn to not care. Live loosely in life. And not get tested unless I feel something for certain.

tta4bc,"Tingling/prickling sensations after 6 months post potential exposure Hi everyone, 

I wanted to come on here and ask if anyone has ever had negative igg testing for HSV but still had physical symptoms suggestive of it that persisted despite that? My last igg was done around 5 1/2 months after potential exposure which I think may have been in September (September 30th). 

I did a blood test around March 11th, 2022 igg that came back negative which I thought would give me relief but I am curious if anyone has ever continued to test negative at this point and tested positive a little later?

Another question I had, if I am in Canada, am I able to order the western blot test? I have heard about it but not sure how to go about ordering it because I have read it's the most accurate testing that can be done. 

The only reason I want to get tested to confirm 100% is that despite my negative igg blood test, had I not had any symptoms.. I think I would be at ease but I did experience symptoms within what would technically be the ""incubation"" period. I had a severe burning and itchy vagina, extremely swollen, stinging pain and tingling/prickling needle like sensation in my vagina and in my back which is so weird. I also had liquid like discharge that seemed kind of clear, but also had some stained discharge which seemed like blood at some point. I did not notice any ""sores"" but I did have cuts. I think I would have been at peace with my IGG blood work if these tingling sensations hadn't been persisting but I still feel ""weird"" and not normal down there and the tingling is on going every day comes and goes. 

I have never experienced this in my life before. My symptoms were present for at least 4 weeks I would say and then when everything calmed down the stinging and tingling sensations have persisted and never went away. and now I continue to feel them on a daily basis in my back and vagina and it's bothering me so much I'm not sure what to do about it but have read that this can be a thing with herpes (nerve pain). 

Has anybody else had a similar experience? Looking for some insight here. I just don't want to feel like I am going crazy. 

And do you recommend I try to get the western blot done? Is it more accurate at not missing HSV 1?

ttfc95,"Opinions I would like your opinion. I received oral sex from a girl while very drunk so I didn‚Äôt notice anything. The next day we hung out and she had multiple yellow crusted things about a centimeter under her bottom lip. I freaked out and thankfully she was nice enough to go to a family doctor and dermatologist. The family doctor said it was impetigo and prescribed her some ointment. From what I can tell the ointment worked as it was basically gone the next day but I also fear since the things were crusted, if they actually were cold sores then they would have been almost healed anyways. While hanging out I noticed I felt very tired and kind of sick. But judging from what I read it was probably too early for my flu like symptoms to be herpes related since it had only been one day. Fast forward about a month I developed a rash on my testicles and pretty extreme itching feelings all over my penis and testicles. My testicles then developed a rash almost all over them. My penis also has some small rashes on it under the head. I continued feeling slightly off for weeks going from doctor to doctor trying to find out what was going on with my penis. About 4-6 weeks after I got with her I found out I had mono. The rash never went away to my knowledge in those weeks but I can‚Äôt say for sure, I‚Äôm hoping it did not though as that would mean it‚Äôs most likely non herpetic from what I‚Äôve seen you say. Well when my mono symptoms got worse so did the rash on my testicles. Also, to add on to this about a month after I got with her I noticed weird things on my lips but multiple doctors said they were not cold sores. I also developed rashes on my butt but they turned out to be mono rashes which can be all over the body. I have taken many many pictures to document this and would like your opinion.

tt2gdk,"Feeling less attractive knowing my status It's hard enough working up the courage to flirt and facilitate some sort of sexual connection! It used to be such an exciting rush, something fun and freeing and just... human? Knowing my status causes me so much internal turmoil it amplifies my insecurities and ability to forge ahead in these scenarios. It's fucking bananas that NOT getting tested and/or knowing your status wouldn't make me feel insecure and the opposite is what is causing such mental/emotional strain! I almost feel punished for getting tested annually. Like I wish I came up with an actual plan for what I would do if I ever tested positive. But I didn't, I would just breathe a sigh of relief and think ""it won't happen to me! Look at me being responsible and shit!"" 

We are the ones actually caring about our bodies and actively trying to lower the risk of transmission for our partners! Shouldn't we feel empowered by this knowledge and not burdened? Shouldn't our partners feel relieved in the fact that we do know our status instead of rolling the dice with someone who doesn't? 

I don't think I feel comfortable taking on any future partners without me being on daily Valtrex, Lysine (and not currently experiencing an OB, obvi) and with a condom.

ttc76s,"Could I have herpes? Hello reddit community. 
I am a male in my 20‚Äôs and yesterday I‚Äôd engaged in some very light casual romance with 2 different escorts. 

We did not make out however they kissed my body, we then cuddled and then I kissed their body. I fear that some of their saliva might have ended up around my lips or in my mouth although I did not notice this at the time. 
Additionally I did not kiss their genitals however I did kiss their chest, buttocks, neck and cheeks but did not get within 1-2 inches of their mouth or ~ 3 inches from genitals (their underwear was always on). I also shortly after the encounter bit the inside of my lip while eating so I‚Äôm worried that this might have increased my likelihood of exposure. They both ensured me they didn‚Äôt have any STI‚Äôs however today I have some very light burning just below and just above my lips. It‚Äôs been less than 24 hours so I doubt symptoms can appear that quickly. Any thoughts? Could it just be irritated from all the kissing? Should I be worried?

Looks like a mosquito bite, hurts the same as when I touch a mosquito bite actually. 

The size is a bit bigger than a mosquito bite and feels as if it was filled with something but does not pop 

No itching, no burning, nothing. Matter of fact, if I hadn‚Äôt seen it I wouldn‚Äôt know it‚Äôs there. 

It started last Wednesday after sex with my partner (we had sex like 4-5 times the day before). Then Wednesday it was coming in. By Monday it was mostly gone but we once again had sex like 4-5 times and it got bigger and red and well (the picture). 

I have had STD tests in February where I am fully negative, but I don‚Äôt know if maybe it was a false negative. Full panel. 

My partner is near damn virgin, and she‚Äôs also very safe. All her tests were negative as well. 

What is that? Herpes? 

The doctor was very unhelpful and I will know my results shortly from the lab (days late) but I am aware that‚Äôs not how antibodies work and the doctor was very against taking a swab of the thing. (What they are supposed to do).

Does that look like herpes to you? I am asking because when I Google herpes it looks like you just got the game of thrones grayscale but I am sure that‚Äôs an exaggeration. (Meant that as in, I know it‚Äôs not that bad so Google is showing me bs)

tswwhx,"I have herpes but my doctor does not think what I‚Äôm describing are outbreaks, and she won‚Äôt give me daily Valtrex Hi all. I‚Äôve had herpes since 2017. I just had a chat with my new doctor and I‚Äôm feeling a bit upset.

I‚Äôve never had any pain with my herpes, it‚Äôs always just been itchiness. The itchiness is inside and around my vagina. It comes and goes and was one of the first symptoms I had of HSV. Sometimes it lasts a long time and it‚Äôs just so uncomfortable. 

I went to a doctor before and she said that does not sound like herpes, but we never got to the bottom of it.

I have just been living with the itchiness since, but I have now gone to a new doctor, and she is adamant that what I am describing is not herpes. 

Furthermore, she has told me that she will not prescribe daily Valtrex because I am not having outbreaks. I told her that I really feel that I am, and part of why I want to take it daily is also to reduce transmission to sexual partners. 

She told me that this is not enough of a reason to put me on a daily medication, and she has never prescribed it daily for anyone. 

I‚Äôm feeling upset, to be honest. I feel like no one understands this condition. 

Does anyone else have itchiness with no pain? Maybe what I‚Äôm describing really is not a symptom of my herpes?

Long story short, I found valacyclovir pills in my boyfriends bathroom bag along with the ointment. I was recently added onto his benefits and I don't think he realized that I could see the prescriptions he had. Something felt off when I asked him about it. He got weirdly defensive and his whole demeanour changed. He says he takes them to prevent cold sores. When I saw the script history, he had been getting 500mg tabs every month- 2 months since late 2020.

Upon further research I saw that the dosage to prevent for each simplex was different, actually I didn't see much about having to take it every day for hsv1. I also read that the ointment is primarily used for genital herpes, where as the cream was primarily for oral herpes.

Is this true? Can anyone shed some light as to what this means?

I had no clue and I feel insanely bad about it. Now she‚Äôs haunted about our anniversary time and oral sex. (She‚Äôs in therapy for unrelated reasons but has talked about it with her therapist). She will go down on me but absolutely resents getting head and even after a year with me asking periodically she‚Äôs not interested. She recently came to me upset saying I felt so guilty I never addressed the issue and ignored the fact I gave her this skin disease that causes her to suffer monthly and that me not acknowledging that and not helping her hasn‚Äôt made her more inclined to get head. She‚Äôs right and honestly I feel shitty in so many aspects. I just want to help her. I‚Äôm a year late and I have no idea what to do. But I plan on marrying her and I really genuinely want to find a way to fix this. Obviously and unfortunately I can back what I gave her, did, or didn‚Äôt do. But if anyone has any advice on what I can do I‚Äôm all ears. I just want her to feel better. 

I also want to add that she‚Äôs been a great partner to me. She doesn‚Äôt hold what happened against me and has worked hard to catch up with me sexually. We genuinely love each other.

tsa3fp,"Hey guys I need your help/advice So about 6 months ago, I pretty much went on a 4 day bender and absolutely wrecked my body. I would get near blackout every night and also lift during the day so my body was extremely fatigued and hungover the whole weekend. But regardless, I wanted to have fun. One of the nights I went out, I made out with two random girls and had sex with one of them. Towards the end of the weekend on Sunday, I started to get
very sick. The following day I saw a little dot on my mouth that started tingle but didn‚Äôt think too much of it. It eventually got bigger and felt like a pimple on my lip that would tingle when I touched it but was never too bad, and went away after 4 days. I did a lot of research and it seems like I got a cold sore outbreak. I then asked the two girls that I hooked up with if they ever experienced outbreaks to which they both said no. I then went to the doctor to get a swab done and as they were looking they told me it looked like a cold sore. However, the test that was done came back negative a few days later.

Fast forward to the present, I haven‚Äôt had any other outbreaks since but I‚Äôm started to feel a tingle on my mouth again right where I got that initial outbreak. The tingle has lasted several days but I haven‚Äôt seen an outbreak yet. I think I‚Äôm going to get a blood test done this weekend to confirm if I have Hsv or not. Which I‚Äôm pretty sure it is.

After my most recent conquest, I had a sore throat and a headache that lasted for a couple of days. At first, I thought that it was just the weather or pollen (which is very high in my area), but then I noticed my nose getting red and forming bumps when my headache and sore throat went away. Initially, I thought they were just oily bumps and didn't think much of it but they hurt and look different than what I normally get. They're small, yellowish bumps in a cluster around the tip of my nose and hurt when I touch them, almost like a burning sensation. They look more like blisters than an oil-clogged pore. There was also one above my lip too that I picked at (whoops). Something just doesn't seem or feel right, and after my spree of strangers, it makes me wonder if I have herpes or not. I'm getting tested tomorrow so hopefully, I will have official clarity within the next couple of days. Of course, all of this is happening days before my first date which I haven't had in over a year and I am not sure what to do.

I am a female who is sexually active with a single parter, been tested for everything in between partners. 
I recently got a few small itchy bumps on my inner thigh (2 mid way down my thigh and 3 in a triangle on the crease of my leg). I have had a herpes scare before but it ended up being a Staph Infection. Now, the bumps are different and it‚Äôs more than one. They itch sometimes but not often, mostly at night. They started as tiny red bumps and are still, no sign of blisters that I can tell. It‚Äôs been about 4 days and from my knowledge of herpes, they would start blistering today or in a couple more days. 
I have no flu symptoms or anything, I have had chronic yeast infections so I have had abnormal discharge, but nothing that I haven‚Äôt had the past 6 months (is being addressed). 

I got a full panel std test (including hsv) yesterday because I got worried. My partner says he‚Äôs clean and has tested before he was with me but I am not sure if he is being faithful or not. I don‚Äôt want to say anything because it very well could be some weird spider bite (I got a couple on my leg and foot that were similar a few days ago but these bumps are lasting longer). 

I asked my doctor and since I have been concerned about it before, they just told me to do the std test and didn‚Äôt want to see me. I‚Äôm going to a minute clinic tomorrow just to see their opinion (it‚Äôs like urgent care but at cvs). 

I have no idea what to do and all the pictures of herpes online and on here don‚Äôt line up with mine. Would really love some guidance. I‚Äôve been taking pictures of them everyday and they haven‚Äôt changed much.

tr4nul,"Does this look like herpes? Long term itching Posted a couple days ago but things have slightly worsened since from what i can see. Essentially, i had protected sex with a woman (Im a male) last year in August. No kissing. But she gave me head without a condom on. I dont have any herpes symptoms at all (Fever, pain, cold sores) - and my penis has been completely fine since. Nothing indicating anything off.

Since October, i started to develop an itch on my bum. It‚Äôs basically been consistently itching since. Mostly bad at night time but if i take a poop the itching flares up sometimes. I have no other symptoms. No pain. Nothing of the sort. Just a consistent itch since then. It‚Äôs itched every night since October to now, and yes i know im a little crazy for not going to see a doctor already. So please save that haha. Just a little stumped. I do plan to try a hydrocortisone and if that does nothing i will bite the bullet. Howver i thought id post here first to check. I had someone tell me it looks like hemmeroids (the little swollen part directly on my anus) but the red patches look odd and thats where the primary itching comes from. There‚Äôs no liquid in them, they just bleed if i scratch them.

The redness and itch also extends up my entire buttcrack, with another one of those red patches at the very top.

tqg0sx,"Why herpes is tricky. This is a tricky virus because it‚Äôs the only virus that somehow gets into our nerve receptors. The immune system has no filtering of that bodily system. 

The virus also has several tricks to hide and cloak itself even when it is living dormant in a cell membrane. 

The virus‚Äôs favorite receptor it used to originally infect us is by attacking our Heparan sulfate (HS) which is a linear polysaccharide found in all animal tissues. Which are basically the carbohydrate molecules on our skin. 

After that it‚Äôs in and there is a lot of enigma on how it then fuses and also how it gets into our nervous system and able to constantly re infect us over & over.


So far gene therapy/editing seems like the only route that might stand a chance on getting the virus out of our nervous system and trials are being done on animals. 

Education is needed like this because I was once suicidal but when you start looking at it from a logical technical analysis you just start to realize it‚Äôs a whole another world going on at the microscopic level. Viruses aren‚Äôt by definition alive, like bacteria but it‚Äôs quite amazing how these things move and protect themselves and procreate and replicate.

2 weeks ago, however, I had an outbreak that was worse than usual. I was in the uk (I live in Spain usually) so bought some aciclovir from a pharmacy there.

Within the next few days I started to feel really bad. My vision was blurry, I was super fatigued, thirstier than usual and pissing like a racehorse. I also had diarrhoea, headaches and tingling in my arms and legs. 

It seems like lots of these can be aciclovir side-effects, but they‚Äôre rare. At first I was convinced I‚Äôd developed diabetes, but thankfully a visit to the doctors for a blood test reassured me that wasn‚Äôt the case.

So. Has anybody ever had side-effects like this from aciclovir? I have taken it before with no qualms.

It‚Äôs only really bad at night. I dont feel the urge to itch during the day at all, hence why i‚Äôve gone for so long without seeking help. Also after a poop it tends to get a little itchy as well. The dark red spots ive itched and caused them to bleed before slightly, but that mightve also been from itching too hard at night. I have no other symptoms. No pain or discomfort, apart from the itching of course. Also as far as i know the herpes ‚Äòsores‚Äô have liquid in them. The red spots i have just bleed when i scratch them and then slightly disappear.

tqcup3,"[UPDATE] Was told by two medical professionals I likely had Herpes. After being tested it turned out to be Syphilis. Get tested. Just wanted to put up an update to a post I made over the weekend. 

For context, in mid-February I had a sore or two on my penis and based on my symptoms I had assumed I had herpes and was going to let the first OB heal while I was traveling for work before going to a doctor. When it never fully healed and I started to get *new* symptoms (Balanitis) in mid-March I went to an Urgent Care. 

The professional at the Urgent Care spent 5-10 minutes talking to me and said I'd be better off going to a health clinic that does more comprehensive STI testing. However, they said that I very likely had herpes and I'd probably only be going to confirm it. 

I scheduled an appointment at a clinic (Planned Parenthood) two days later. I did comprehensive STI testing (blood, urine, swabbing) and talked with a doctor there. They also said I most likely had herpes, but a couple of things I said made them think there's a chance it might be Syphilis instead. 

Over the weekend I got even more symptoms (non-itchy rash on my trunk, general fatigue). The results came back today and they said I was only positive for Syphilis (Stage II). Luckily it's treatable with an injection of penicillin in the hip/buttocks. If I had gotten tested sooner, I would have only needed to take some pills for it. 

General takeaway is don't just assume, make sure you get tested. If I had kept assuming that I had something that I didn't and had gone without treatment, this could have turned into a more damaging and potentially deadly problem.

tqaqtn,"Day Old Diagnosis So today is my first full day after my diagnosis, got my results emailed back to me yesterday. In all reality I‚Äôve likely had it much longer without knowing. 

I had been seeing a guy off and on for about a year. Turns out he had been cheating the entire time with multiple women. One of them found my Instagram and contacted me, and through talking to her found out she had herpes and they had unprotected sex AFTER she told him. Looking at the timing realizing he most certainly had unprotected sex with me after this date. 

When I found that out I scheduled an appointment at my gyno who actually sort of dissuaded me from getting the test as I hadn‚Äôt had an actual outbreak saying ‚Äúoh you would know, and we would swab the outbreak anyway‚Äù. So I felt relieved and went on my merry way. 

I have slept with this man since then (a questionable decision, but a discussion for another time or subreddit). He showed me a screenshot of his test with HSV negative. Now I believe he either doctored it, or he was tested too soon after exposure and got a false negative. I believe this because he is the only person I have slept with during that entire time period and since, and I have since had two small outbreaks. There‚Äôs a possibility I‚Äôve had it for years, but with the timing of the outbreaks I believe it is from him. 

Anyway I had an outbreak this week after sex with him and I decided to go get a blood test. Results came back yesterday as abnormal. 

We had gotten in an argument about something else that resulted in him leaving my house. But I texted him my results, he read the message and all those after, and has said nothing. 

I‚Äôve been bouncing between devastated and somewhat alright. Devastated mostly at the situation itself. And alright in reading some posts here and seeing that people live pretty normal lives with HSV2. 

I have no interest in being intimate with anyone new anytime soon as I will have to process my involvement with him and heal, which I think will take a very long time. But maybe this is a blessing in disguise, to help me see who values me as a person regardless of my health concerns.

tqin94,"Symptom timeline question GHSV2 Exposure 11 days ago. Shaved that morning, I used a condom, partner on antivirals with no outbreak.

Morning after ‚Äúsymptoms‚Äù, headache probably from lack of sleep. ED just for the day from anxiety. And noticeable razor burn from shaving the day before which left what looked to be a spot that grew into a bump which is harder than what I‚Äôve read herpetic lesions are and skin colored not clear with fluid or puss. Urinary urgency. I know the day after more than likely has nothing to do with anything other than Anxiety since it‚Äôs too soon.

4 days after exposure noticed urinary urgency continued. No ‚Äúflu symptoms‚Äù just slight cold symptoms became noticeable, sore throat, sinus congestion, respiratory congestion. Also noticed scrotum was dry and flakey. Noticeable skin flakiness if scratched but not itchy. My thoughts were eczema or contact dermatitis since I started using a new body wash. This also left inflamed fordyce spots and raw skin in some places the dry skin came off. There was one inflamed fordyce spot that had dry skin where I rubbed it off and maybe clear liquid came out, but from what I‚Äôve read contact dermatitis can cause this (picture of this spot added at bottom of Imgur). This flakiness has continued since.

6 days after exposure constipation started. A laxative alleviated and fixed urinary urgency. Constipation continued since just not nearly as bad to the point it‚Äôs causing bladder discomfort.

10 days after exposure I noticed a tingle or static feeling in calves. As well as slight leg weakness. The tingle and leg weakness have lasted maybe 12 hours where they were noticeable and have gone down to not really noticeable unless I pay attention to it.

Currently no typical herpetic blister groups just what seemed to be contact dermatitis causing inflamed fordyce spot on scrotum and the possible razor burn bump that started showing up morning after a bit further from base of penis near pubic hair region (pics here. the razor bump is timeline order from day1 to current/top to bottom [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/m4rzfL1)).

Couple weeks later we have full intercourse unprotected but it lasts maybe 2 minutes (he couldn‚Äôt keep it up lol)

Few days after this I‚Äôm super itchy, mostly noticing at night. I found myself waking up scratching the same spot but whenever I looked it didn‚Äôt notice much, just redness and some white spots. I decide to pray it ends soon and do nothing (smart I know) but it goes on for a while. I look again and see a fissure between my inner and outer labia which is where I had been scratching. It was very long and white, no pain. This makes me decide to try yeast infection treatment along with steroid cream. Same time the fissure is there I‚Äôm a little tender at the opposite side of my vulva when I press on it but other than that I never had any severe pain, blistering, I could pee just fine. 

I take the one day canesten pill and use the anti fungal  cream and steroid cream and things start to feel way better and the fissure is gone within two days. After a few days I stop the applications and go on my merry way feeling much better 

Then about a week or so later (January now..) I‚Äôm itchy and irritated down there again so I go back to the cream and it seems to get better.  Never get another fissure or anything. Repeat this until today where I continue to get these bouts of itchy and irritation. 

I have anxiety and googled the fissure and got worried I had contracted genital herpes. I‚Äôve had a cold sore in the past so I know if I test I‚Äôd have that. I‚Äôve mentioned this to my family doctor and he didn‚Äôt seem worried and because I had no issues at the time said to bring it up at my next PAP which he has referred me out for because they don‚Äôt do them.

I disclosed before anything physical happened and it was a deal breaker for him. We hung out more and tried to see if we could get past it and talk about it , but ultimately he decided that it was not something he was willing to take on.

I went to the dr told them my situation and the dr Basically told me there is no way that it would be herpes since she couldn‚Äôt get a swab done cause she didn‚Äôt see any sores but she did do a yeast infection swab and that came back negative for yeast and she said that the discharge I was getting was do to the hsv1 and 2 any ways I tested for everything and everything came back negative but I just realized that she didn‚Äôt test me for syphillis, and I also researched that it could‚Äôve been to soon to test for hiv ‚Ä¶ so Let‚Äôs back track I started kissing/ making out with dude let‚Äôs say January 15th , February 15th I went and got tested and results came back negative for everything but hsv1 and 2..she gave me 4 pills of valacyclovir and told me next time I feel these symptoms or  get any cold sores to come and ask for more medicine. Smh I think I tested way to soon okay so now here‚Äôs what‚Äôs really troubling me so  ever since then I have not been feeling anything but I‚Äôll .  When I asked my dr if I can get the igg levels she basically told me that they don‚Äôt do the levels there and that it does not matter where it is orally or genitals. In my blood I have both strains is what she told me!! So anyways after that I was already feeling better slowly because I think I was already getting out of my first out break. So I‚Äôm trying to cope with all of this but okay since the dr diagnosed me I have been feeling nothing but Ill , I got my period march 14th and I think during that time I was experiencing my second out break again all the symptoms and no sores ! I felt lower thigh pain, fever, again my eye pain was out of this world and I even noticed I have more little bumps around my eyes nose and mouth that aren‚Äôt cold sores but look like tiny little white heads that won‚Äôt pop they are all over my eye lids and under my eye and lips and nose and they won‚Äôt go away , anyways what‚Äôs troubling me now is for ten days straight I have had a ringing in my head and in my ears and awful head aches .. and now I‚Äôm scared because it‚Äôs not going away idk if I got tinnitus? Or if it can be due another std because I said they never tested me for syphillis and my hiv came back negative but what if I tested to soon for everything?!!! So I‚Äôve be. Having this constant ear and head ringing like it does not stop not one second and my eyes have been so bad I‚Äôve noticed more reddish veins around it  inside my eyes and and I‚Äôve noticed now that my vision has changed dramatically! I‚Äôve had glasses since the 6th grade and my vision has been the same since I was in sixth grade !! I am near sited so I need help seeing far away things but now I can‚Äôt even see anything up close ! I put my phone close to my face and I can‚Äôt even read the letters and everything is so blurry! And even when I look far I am still super blurry and getting worse ! Am I going blind ? Idk if this can be all from hsv1 and 2 I just feel like there is no  way! And they say that it is rare to catch hsv2 orally but that‚Äôs how I got it from making out ! So now tomorrow I booked another dr appointment and I‚Äôm going to go and get blood drawn and tested for every std again and I‚Äôm going to ask them to std test me for hiv and syphillis again but it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôve been scared to go to the dr because just the hsv1 and 2 has fucked  with my mental health so bad idk how I‚Äôm going to handle anything else! Anyways I‚Äôm going to post this in a few other Reddit groups relating to stds and tinnitus Groups! I just hope it isn‚Äôt to soon to get tested but I just have not been feeling okay!

If we're both positive, unless we get frequent outbreaks is there any benefit to taking anti virals daily?
 Is it bad to have sex if you have an outbreak? can an active outbreak trigger an outbreak in your partner? 
Is there anything else we should know or be careful of?

tpvmzd,"Can anyone chime in? Just looking for opinions, feeling quite overwhelmed Hello all,

I was diagnosed via swab with gHSV-1 on my penis just under 3 weeks ago, and the first symptoms came a little before that.  I had two clusters under my foreskin, and a few pimple looking spots on the outside of my foreskin that eventually popped and scabbed over (about the size of very small pimples, or pin points). I took no antivirals, and the sores looked a little better for a while. 

I have nothing external anymore, but beneath my foreskin looks quite red and blotchy.  No big, open painful clusters like before, but some red patches that are redder than the rest.  I‚Äôve always had some irritation under my foreskin, but now with the herpes it‚Äôs hard to differentiate between that and an outbreak.  I‚Äôve been using some Ketaconazole cream under my foreskin that my dermatologist told me was okay to use and wouldn‚Äôt negatively impact the herpes.  

Just mainly looking for anyone to chime in about their first outbreak and how long it took to heal, and if anyone has had irritation that seems to be a little persistent.  Does this sound normal for a newly diagnosed case of gHSV1?  I‚Äôm just so worried about having constant outbreaks and always being symptomatic with a high transmission rate. :(

tp8is7,"I am sick of pretending herpes does not ruin your life I am really sorry if that upsets or offends anyone but I need to get this off my chest and rant.

I foubd out a few months ago someone gave me herpes and ever since I have been deeply suicidal, I came online to learn more about it and it is driving me insane. I have had to come to terms with the reality of being a man with herpes.

First of all casual hook ups are basically gone from my life, the same thing that most young people get to enjoy has been taken from me forever by what doctors call a ""simple skin condition"" I have checked online, seen polls and even commemts on here from people like myself who got it saying if they had known they would not have hooked up and why would they? Herpes is literally the only other non curable STD besides HIV and it ruins your life. So from now on I will be the guy who gets rejected 90%+ of the time and be the guy who women discuss with their friends they went home with and he had herpes and they had to go home.

And in the hopes of finding love that has now dropped by a very large margin and not only that if I ever find soneone kind enough to be accepting I have to spend the rest of our relationship worrying that the one kind and accepting person has an ever increasing chance of getting this horrible STD and its not fair on them. They get punished for being accepting and if they are unlucky enough to get severe symptos and pain I will probably have a mental breakdown.

And ontop of that there are millioms out there who have it and dont know or dont care who get to live a somewhat normal life while because I know yet have no symptoms I ""have"" to just accept my sex life is over and tell people and take antivirals that thin my hair and other side effects forever.

There are other more serious illnesses in the world but people are kidding themselves if they say herpes does not ruin a large part of your life as a guy.

tpe1q2,"is this herpes or just more anxiety? 1st outbreak? corner of mouth 29m - So i have high anxiety when it comes skin issues and stds. I have very sensitive skin and always have. This involves something new to myself i would like some advice. Skip below to see main questions. Is this herpes on my face? Did my ex give me herpes? 

About me - I am also poliamorous and try to be as ethical as i can and safe as i can. Sometimes ladies lie and things get messy but its pretty hard to fake an std test. I've had my some come out to me about being hsv+ and others that refused to take the test and i made the hard choice to leave sometimes. Or stay and learn. My friends are + we haven't had an issue because it doesn't involve me so i try to respect and understand the situation for anyone. I always ask and I'm getting tested annually and am hyper aware of my skin. Its not healthy mentally i know and i try to stop myself but things pop up only to be vitamin deficiency to fordoyce spots to random cases of ""skin discoloration"" which is a thing that happens with age i guess. I have other issues but we get the point. 

How i possibly got it - i decided to take a break from sex and dating to focus on my career. When a girl that changes plans. I try to resist and she pursues and i genuine liked more than anything for a while. One day (in the middle of covid) i notice is wearing a mask around me more and has a bandaid on her face. I asked what it was and she said a cold sore, i immediately was like what? I had fallen so fuckin quick i skipped my safety procedures. She claimed its not herpes and that her mom (a doc) had said it's not herpes. As the conversation went, She made me feel bad for pursuing the thought and to leave it. It went away in a week as if nothing was there. I kept my distance during that time but we did go on dates and share food and she kissed me once or twice but was sad i wasnt too comfortable with it. We lasted a 16 months or so and this was only one time and no where else did it happen. 

Me - fordyce spots on lip, black heads on lips, dry skin  and chapped lips and canker sores from time time due to tmj and slight tension that moves my jaw. I look normal its like muscle pulls and slight face swelling. Barely noticeable and confirmed by dentist and others but can also cause migraines. I got tested at the end for everything and was fine once again 3 rounds with top tier health insurance at the time. 7 months after, i find another great girl, we went on our second date we made out and she went down on me. We hung out the next day and she had this kind of deep cough and informed me that it could be strep throat. That she always gets cuz lung issues while we were 420... 
The next day the spot appeared in the pink part of my lips. 

The spot is on one side of my corner of my mouth and it looked like a zit. My anxiety hit and i popped it and a white spot came out and some fluid, followed by blood. Symptoms after - its scabed up and the white head came back. Just 1 white zit, no tingles or stinging. I do have some itching but i wear a mask now. Something new and the itching takes place randomly on my upper lip. Never the corners of my mouth. I think its my small mustache with the mask. Ive have had a headache that feels different from my migraines recently though and have been feeling extra dehydrated and groggy at times. No pain on its own. Only when it was scabbed and i streched my mouth. but the white spot grew in the healing process. Not that much but still. Now it feels healed but i have a light spot there now. Is it done healing?

I got a full STD test on Feb of this year per request of a new person I was seeing.  I had confessed to him that my long marriage ended because my ex-husband cheated on me and left me for someone else. This new person was worried, and I completely understood why, and since we were sleeping together already, he was very concerned.As soon as I got my results from Labquest that I had both HSV 1 and HSV 2 , I informed this person, and he immediately told me we shouldn't see each other until he got tested and received his results. I was devastated.

Two and half weeks passed, and I sent him a text that I was worried about him since I hadn't heard from him since that day I told him of my results. He told me that his doctor told him that HSV is no big deal and half of the population has it, but since his results were negative, he didn't want to get exposed by continuing seeing me. To say I was crushed would be an understatement.

I got the results by email today from Terri that I'm HSV 1 positive and HSV 2 negative. But it just doesn't make a difference to me. Herpes is herpes, doesn't matter which one it is, and I'm still depressed about losing this person that I really saw potential to have a relationship with over something so trivial.

tpc17y,"Some advice please 21yo male.  
I did an STD test last week because I had unprotected sex with someone questionable on new year's. I have since then gotten a girlfriend who I have been very sexually active with.  
On March 15th, I had unprotected sex with my girlfriend, while she had a UTI (not smart, and yes it was kinda nasty). The following morning, I woke up with a cluster of pimples above my shaft. No pain or anything. I also felt a mild burning sensation when I was peeing, but it was barely noticable.  
I got an STD test the following friday, and last friday I recieved the news that I tested positive on the Herpes IGG test with a score of 1.17. Negative on the IGM test. My doctor told me that I had herpes, and talked about prescribing some medications for it. 

Since then, the pimples went away except one, which I popped (stupid), which formed a into lump on my skin. Another lump appeared on the shaft of my penis. 

As you can imagine, I'm freaking out, and have been diving into research. I see a lot of studies and people saying that low positive scores have a high likelihood of being false positive. a 1.17 is just above the ""equivocal"" barrier on the test.

Do these symptoms sound like herpes, or could it just be bacteria that I caught from my girlfriends UTI? I didn't notice any symptoms following the questionable sex on new years. Only until right after having UTI sex did anything come up. 

I dunno man, I've been really tripping about this for the past couple days. Does it seem pretty likely that I have herpes?

tp33b5,"Any support appreciated Hi everyone, let me start by saying I‚Äôm very new to all of this. I‚Äôm a 24 y/o female, still in college, and my life is typically pretty happy. I learned about a month ago that I have both HSV1 and HSV2 which came as a total shock considering I haven‚Äôt had any symptoms and I have had a really hard time accepting the diagnosis. I was depressed for a while after learning this and was convinced my sex life was done for. But I found hope a few weeks later when I started dating one of my best friends who I‚Äôve known since my first day of classes at my university. I quickly realized I like him a lot and we took things slow and were having a really wonderful time. When we talked about how we wanted to have sex at some point, I went back to my doctor with a list of questions so that I could become properly educated on the matter and feel more confident about everything. My doctor answered all my questions and told me that it is possible to have a normal sex life which was reassuring to hear. I was extremely anxious about disclosing everything for the first time but knew he had the right to know before we had sex of any kind. I figured if my best friend wouldn‚Äôt accept me for this, then who would? So I disclosed it to him and explained the basics on HSV and how I‚Äôve never had any outbreaks, take a daily antiviral, and how my doctor told me I could have a normal sex life. I also told him how my doctor said we could both come in for an appointment if he had any questions about it. Long story short he thought on it for less than a day and then dropped me. He said he didn‚Äôt even want to kiss me or cuddle me anymore because of it. I‚Äôm still in shock at his reaction and how he went about everything and have since fallen into a dark depression that I have struggled to come out of. It‚Äôs just so hurtful and discouraging that my first disclosure resulted in me losing a love interest and one of my best friends.

He texted me today and said he has had what he described as a cold since Wednesday (7 days after his potential exposure). Unfortunately, he didn‚Äôt tell me his specific cold symptoms. Could I have transmitted my potential hsv to him? Would hsv cause cold symptoms for 4 days with no OB? I‚Äôm not sure where his potential OB would be (oral or genital) and I am really freaking out.

toxukn,"Was told by two medical professional I likely had Herpes, but I am beginning to doubt it because of difference in symptoms. Still awaiting results 1 week after getting tested. Any insight on what to expect based on my symptoms? For context: I am male. Age 27. 5'11"" and 180lbs. Physically active, nutritionally healthy. 

In mid-to-late January I had unprotected sex with an on-again-off-again girlfriend. Shortly after, at some point she told me that she had also been sleeping with somebody else on occasion in late November/December/early January. Soon after that, she had told me that he had mentioned that she may need to get tested--but did not specify for what. 

From what I was told by her, both he and she got tested and the results came back negative. I don't really trust them saying that, and I've never seen official documentation to prove it. 

**My symptoms showed up maybe ~3 weeks later:**

* **In mid February I had a single large, dark red, distinct bump on my shaft just beneath the head of my penis.** (It might have been two bumps right next to each other? At this point I'm second-guessing myself) **It was painless** and I only noticed it by chance when I was laying down. 

The following two and a half weeks had me travelling consecutively both for work and pleasure, and I didn't have time to go to a clinic. After some reading I assumed it was probably herpes and I would let the first outbreak run its course before deciding to go to a doctor when I got better. 

* **In late February the sore burst against the pressure of the water in the shower**. This, too, was painless. There was a **mostly sticky, yellow pus/discharge underneath it**. The skin beneath it was raw and deep. Overtime this developed into feeling like scar tissue. 

This was when I initially did begin feeling some pain. The broken skin was raw and uncomfortable when I would go on runs. Sometimes if I was walking especially far. This would also be a problem at night when I would have erections in my sleep or morning wood when waking up. Over time this began to heal but at a snail pace and it is still not done healing.

* **In mid-March I started experiencing new symptoms: an irritable rash-like region on the top of my shaft surrounded by lots of dry flaky skin. A few days later, a single hard white bump appeared underneath the head on the opposite side from the ulcer. A couple days after that, my foreskin (I am circumcised) began swelling immensely. It felt like I had half an erection at all times. There was now more irritation and even some itching.**

This is when I decided to visit an Urgent Care. I told them my symptoms and they said while they did do *some* STD testing, they didn't do enough of a comprehensive one and that I should go to one of the local clinics in my city that did or my primary doctor. They said based upon my description their best guess was probably herpes but I should find out for myself. 

I went to the first available opening at a clinic for testing two days later/this past Tuesday. I described my symptoms and they also said they think it could likely if not probably be herpes, but there is a chance it might be Syphilis instead. The irritation + swelling + flaky/hard skin bumps they said was **Balanitis** and that I likely had a male yeast infection and to get some miconazole cream to treat it with. They did a comprehensive STD test screening (blood, urine, swab on the still yellow+sticky pus/discharge) and told me results will likely take 3-5 days, but they would call me in 1-2 days with some of the initial results to rule a few things out. I've yet to hear anything back. 

Latest developments: 

* I am near the end of week 6 of the ulcer (or 6 weeks since it began as a bump/2 bumps). It is still healing slowly. There is still some yellow sticky discharge/pus.
* After applying the miconazole cream 2-3 times a day, I've seen improvement on the flaky skin + irritation. The white hard bump fell off after two days of use. The rest of the flaky skin is improving but not completely done. The swelling has gone down a lot except for in the area nearest the original ulcer. 
* Today I noticed for the first time that I have some red dots appearing on my trunk. They are near my stomache, chest, sides, and back. It almost looks like a rash but they don't itch at all. 

I'm coming here because I've been lurking through old threads on this subreddit ever since the first bump appeared, but now it seems like my symptoms are deviating from what is the norm for herpes.

tosvc6,"Just so sick and tired of getting coldsores... First time posting in any sort of coldsore/herpes group... Sort of just a mini rant but also looking for comfort, reassurance, suggestions....




I used to get coldsores rarely. It was like a once-a-year kind of thing since I was 15 (28 now). They've been getting more frequent lately over the past few years and it's scary... I had over four of them one year and had a huge scare when I had two at the same time which had never happened before.. I know stress is a factor and my life has become significantly more stressful since we moved to Colorado to take over my husband's dad's company three years ago..

I went to a dermatologist after the 2-at-a-time scare and he prescribed me valacyclovir but he told me to only take 1000mg twice a day when I feel it coming on. He told me if I took 1 when I noticed it coming on and 1 before bed that same day, that it should prevent it from actually forming..The bottle (and the internet) say 2000mg twice a day but i did what the dermatologist told me. I never felt it was working and always still had to use Abreva and suffer for over a week..   

I had a coldsore in late February this year and it ended up lasting over 2 weeks.. I woke up this morning feeling a bump where I had been tonguing a cut from biting my lip accidentally last week. Here we go again üò≠ I know I should have left the cut alone... It feels like every time I have even the slightest cut on my lip it turns into a coldsore... This one is the farthest away from my usual breakout spot too which is terrifying... It used to just be the right side of my lips and this is on the left side near the center.. 

I'm just feeling really... defeated.. disgusting... losing all my self confidence.. I hate it. I hate that I can't kiss my husband, I hate the constant fear of spreading it to other people or to other areas of my body. I over-wash my hands and panic constantly.. I feel gross... I feel undesirable.. I'm just so tired of it and how frequently they occur. I become a hermit when I have a coldsore, out of embarrassment... I have a solid fear of it becoming a permanent thing.. like a coldsore that won't go away that everyone can see and immediately know that I have herpes...

I'm seeing a best friend next Friday, a college friend a couple days later, then flying to my college bff's engagement party the following weekend. Like.. the timing just sucks... I have to get rid of it...

I had three valacyclovir pills left this morning and I took 2 immediately when I knew it was a coldsore.. (idk how I have an odd number, probably forgot to take the night pill one time). It costs me $50 to refill the prescription without a doctor's scrip and I'm planning on doing that again today since the dermatologist is closed until Monday... That way I can take another 2 tonight before bed and hopefully it will go away... This is my first time trying to take 2 in the morning and 2 before bed.. I'm almost afraid to use Abreva because I feel like Abreva speeds up the whole process and it will become a full blown coldsore by tomorrow...

Does anyone have any amazing, incredible, and effective remedies for a coldsore that's just starting? Or at least making it go away within a few days rather than over a week? I'll try anything at this point... I just had one and I'm so sick and tired of how constant they're becoming.. This is my second one this year and we're only in the third month.... 

Halp.

tooold,"Cold Symptoms or Not? Hi,

This is a follow up to my previous post. Since then, I‚Äôve been reading the archives trying to find information without bothering or bugging any of you again in this method.

I know that every human being is different, our bodies and immune systems are different and therefore, symptoms can be different. But I do see a lot of people in this sub that have  said a sore throat/coughing and other cold (as opposed to flu) like symptoms proceeded or accompanied their outbreaks.

As I‚Äôve mentioned before, my friend recently diagnosed with GHSV and on her period and possibly on antivirals stayed with me for a few days, as did another friend. I had the most direct skin to skin contact when rubbing cream on her back where there were pimple-like spots (but since she didn‚Äôt know for a while during her first OB, I‚Äôm not sure if self inoculation occurred). I am the only friend that is sick. Sore throat all one day, less sore throat and cough the next, now cough and stuffy nose. On/off, I feel fine but then the cough and stuffy nose always remind me that I had the sore throat (five days after she first came) and that I have a cold?

I trust her to wash her hands each time she uses the bathroom, but I saw her searching for her tampon once and then finding it and closing the door with her bare hands. I assumed after 10 seconds, it would be fine, but I‚Äôm not sure if living with her for a few days could‚Äôve somehow passed it, especially since my skin is already cracked and torn due to over washing (not burning when sanitizer is applied, but peeling and flaking due to dryness).

I think I am still worried because of the posts in the archives with common cold symptoms and the fact that my other friend is perfectly fine.

to4a0u,"wholesome acceptance So I've always done my best to monitor my health, and be honest with my intimate partners.  I've never tested positive for an STI. I've been much more active and careful about testing between partners, discussing, and asking others to test/disclose ever since receiving a mass text (!) from a person I slept with years ago (2015 or 16 ?) saying that ""if you're receiving this, please get tested""... she had gonorrhea, if I recall correctly, whatever it was, it was treatable... long story short, I got a ""full panel"" and had all negatives. Her example was really inspiring.  I have no idea how many partners she had, but I'm sure it was a significantly higher number than me. No shame on her, she was a lively gal and  actually sounds like she was having a lot of fun ü§£

Anywho,  I was fresh out of a breakup from a long distance relationship back in autumn 2020. We were monogamous, and I hadn't slept with anyone but her in 4 years, fairly certain she was 100% faithfully monogamous too. Hadn't seen her since Feb 2020. Pandemic really ruined our relationship. Long distance and no end in sight to separation. I'll spare the details, but it was tough losing the relationship. It was almost a year after the breakup that I started trying to date in earnest.  I met a really nice girl who I liked a lot,  and I thought it was the right thing to do to get tested just as a general courtesy to anyone I might start a relationship with.  Went on a few dates with this girl, we really started enjoying each other (no pants off dance-off, just a lil smooch here n there thus far). Got my test results back, and everything was clear except an equivocal result for HSV2. I was kinda shocked, because to my knowledge, all my past partners were negative,  no known exposure to STIs. I was kinda shook honestly, but since I was early on in my budding friendship with this new girl,  I took her on a nice hike and we sat down at the peak to rest and have a snack and I just busted it out and told her what was going on. I explained that I've never had symptoms, and I was shocked to receive an equivocal result. I told her that I've learned there can be false positives and that I was asked to test again.  My doc told me that they wanted to see if my body would ""clear the infection"". Not sure if the context that I hadn't slept with anyone in like 18 months really translated to them... anyway, when I told this new girl I was dating,  she surprised me with completely wholesome acceptance. Her response was basically that she wasn't worried about it.  She explained she had a past partner who was hsv2 positive, that she didn't contract it, and tested negative since then.  Getting it off my chest was a huge relief which was exponentially multiplied by her understanding and appreciation for my openness. 

I have since tested two more times,  1 month later and 4 months later than that. Both results were low equivocal range.  Really kinda frustrating because I'm not sure what to do with that info, and don't really know if I should pay for a western blot. Meanwhile, just wanted to share with this community the positive experience of being honest and having that honesty returned with genuine understanding.  We have been dating for 6 months now,  and I've been thinking of asking her if she'd like to cohabitate. Really like her a lot, she's crafty, quite caring, and we have shared hobbies. Also FWIW,  we met  online, and I have always had incredibly low expectations about dating apps, but apparently there are some good human beans out there who are looking for some gentle companionship.

tnzud5,"Tell me your thoughts ‚Ä¶.. Ending Stigma - Just a thought ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.
Yesterday I tried posting this post maybe I chose the wrong subreddit where it was not allowed but it never posted so I figured I would try again here. 

I shared how since my diagnosis on Dec. 2020, I have just been really thinking n wishing there was some way to make this disease more known, ppl need to be educated and just be more aware so that also the horrible stigma can somehow be less or changed completely! 

I was thinking what if HSV was blasted all over the world using billboards, digital billboards like the ones in Times Square, Tv commercials n radio. These could include EVERYTHING.. from education on the difference between HSV1 and HSV2, signs and symptoms, statistics on exposure, statistics on how common it is, benefits of being with someone knowing their status and actively under treatment, education on who can get it - from a person losing their Virginity their 1st time to a person with 1k partners, treatments n medications available now, research n studies happening, ways to donate and encouragement to get checked and ask for HSV as this is not commonly tested during regular std panels etc. 

Marketing- how and who presents it would also be a huge deal on how this message is perceived so using humor , maybe stand up comedy clips of comedians talkn about having herpes , or using those comedians as presenters or the awesome influencers on YouTube or Tik Tok that speak about their experiences with herpes doing the commercials or even respected celebrities who could at least acknowledge, maybe relate or in a way inflict compassion and respect for the disease in someway. 
This way we can also beat the pharmaceutical companies that make those horrible commercials n make ppl like us look like monsters and untouchable bc we have herpes!! üí™üèº

I used to feel like I wanted to hide under a rock, prayed the topic was never brought up and I never had to face it but .. that‚Äôs inevitable and only makes the stigma worse ! Ppl need to know the real truth about HSV and be educated period ! The more ppl know the less of a deal it becomes and the better for us! I‚Äôve also started to learn and accept that if someone is even worth a damn they won‚Äôt automatically dismiss you or not accept you bc of HSV and they will at least want to get educated and see the good qualities about you !!! So ultimately if you fuck with me with my HSV great and if you don‚Äôt okay ‚Ä¶. Keisha carry on !!  ‚úåüèº lol

First off, I am decently educated on the symptoms and mode of transmission of herpes. I mostly want a second opinion on the appearance because of my lack of experience actually seeing herpes in person (and google doesn't help much). I currently do not have any systemic symptoms, and the bumps are not sore or irritated. The ones on the right are similar to razor bumps that I get regularly in that areas, but the ones on the left look different. The grouping is tighter, they are more peaked, and at least one of them has a little bit of a whitehead.

to4nkr,"Newly Diagnosed HSV-1 Questions (M25) Hello,

I hope everyone on here is doing well! I am a 25 year old male who was recently diagnosed with HSV-1 and had a few questions that I am hoping could be answered. Ever since my diagnosis, I have been reading so many posts on here and just wanted to give a sincere shoutout to the community and how supportive they are for diagnosed people.

This diagnosis has come as a complete surprise (although I guess I shouldn't be - more on that below) as I have been asymptomatic for the most part.

I received unprotected oral sex (no other contact or kissing) from someone who had no visible sores. After 11 weeks since this one-time exposure, I got a full STD panel test and tested negative for everything except HSV-1 at an igG value index of 47.6. I was wondering if this is likely from a previous exposure or likely the most recent one 11 weeks ago? I know that igG values don't represent location or when it was contracted, but I was wondering what the likely scenario is given that the value is so high.

The exposure before this was also a one-time exposure in the beginning of July 2021 (approximately 8 months ago). I received protected oral sex and intercourse (no kissing). However, the female did suck on my testicles and spit on my penis a couple times and proceeded to masturbate me. I was wondering if this was a high risk exposure? There were no visible sores either but I know this does not mean the virus is not contractable. I did have some weird symptoms on my genitals. Urge to urinate, incomplete emptying of bladder right after urinating - I actually still have these lingering symptoms until today. I was tested for UTI but was negative so not sure what it was. It might be important to note I was extremely stressed with work during this period so I'm wondering if that's the cause even though those symptoms still come and go when I'm not stressed anymore.

Lastly and the most probable scenario: I dated someone for two years who did have cold sores time to time. I wasn't really aware of how contagious cold sores are and did not even know they were herpes. We shared utensils, lip balm, and engaged in all sorts of unprotected acts. I remember possibly having a primary OB on my lip (right on top of it). Although, I can't tell for sure because I assumed it was a pimple although it seemed a bit different than my usual acne. Even my dad commented on how it looked a bit strange. That was a little more than 2.5 years ago and haven't had any known outbreaks since then (knock on wood).

Basically, I was wondering what the community thought of each of these exposures and how high risk each exposure was. Obviously, I am thinking I contracted it from my long-time ex but wanted to see what the community thought of the most recent two exposures. Lastly, given that I am asymptomatic, other than disclosure to future partners, is there anything I should do differently? Is it still recommended to take the anti-viral drugs?

It's been a hard couple weeks since diagnosis but I have come to accept the fact and trying to grow from it. Thank you in advance for taking the time to read this lengthy post and I hope everyone stays healthy and safe! Will make sure to reply to everyone who replies.

tnovyg,"My achy breaky ... body? So, I'm a first timer, just had my first cold sore outbreak on Tuesday.

I'm not mad or upset, in fact, if it hadn't happened when it did, it'd probably happen a couple of years from now. We're taking it in stride.

tndi5n,"Unique walk down H Lane....years later still not completely sure? Hi, I am a 24yo gay male and I'm definitely a herpes ally (may be silly to say but it's true!), definitely an oHSV carrier, and quite possibly a gHSV carrier. I'll start with some background as then get into my most recent SYMPTOMS. Yes I read the rules on symptoms. I'm going to explain the confusing occurances that have me posting here this evening.

**BACKGROUND**

Child. Cold sores. Like half of the population. We get it.

* Now as an adult, I may get a cold sore every couple of years or so.

19 years old, I have bumps on my junk. Shitty Urgent Care doctor says herpes. No pain, did not even look like herpes. Calls for a blood test. Came back as HSV+....duh, cold sore history.

* Gets call at 8am while still in bed before work. Nurse tells me I have herpes for the rest of my life, have a nice day.
* 19yo me spent WEEKS going down the rabbit hole, thinking my sex life was over, all the terrible things that unfortunatley I know many on this forum are familiar with.
* Thru this however, I became educated realizing the truth, and having had cold sores occasionally in my life made me more familiar/I guess you could say I was slightly more ""comfortable..."" than others would be accepting this.
* Basically came to terms with having herpes...told my parents and even told a potential partner and he was accepting...
* Go on Valtrex, NO CLEARANCE OF SYMPTOMS.

About 4 weeks after the initial diagnosis I see a real doctor, a dermatologist.

* Views my bumps, immediately says it is not herpes, but rather Moluscom Contagioso (sp?), a random ass skin infection that is common in kids, although can be passed thru the genitals in adults too.
* Tells me that the blood test should be considered INCONCLUSIVE, all about how the CDC doesn't recommend the blood tests, that the only way to be sure is to test the fluids from an active infection.
* He burns those bumps off and I'm good as new. Definitely NOT herpes, lol. That would fucking kill.

\~ Past 5 years I've openly been a herpes ally. Any time the topic comes off in a negative light, I'm quick to defend. I've been there, and I know that a huge portion of the population is there, even if they don't know it yet. Should not be stigmatized the way it's been. We all know that. \~

To this date, my total body count is probably 40 people, maybe 50. I am the one to initiate the STI talk before sex every.single.time. I am on PrEP for HIV, and used to use condoms almost always, although I've had unprotected sex with probably 15-20 of those partners after we both disclose that we were both recently tested and I feel decently comfortable. In my life I've had chlamydia twice and ghonnorea once. So, kinda promiscuous but I literally make a point to be responsible more than most people I know...(damn, maybe that's my problem).

**2 Weeks Ago. 24yo (FIRST TRUE OUTBREAK?) These are how my symptoms went:**

* Trims pubes. Cuts my penis where the shaft meets scrotum. Has rough sex a few hours later. Being circumcised, sometimes when I penetrate a partner my penis gets considerably irritated on the sides from the friction with the anus, hair, etc.
* Later that night and the next day, I could feel the residual pain, sort of like brush-burn from the friction on my penis. (TMI but this is why I should just bottom, lol). This is honestly COMMON when I top. (thanks for circumcising me, mom & dad ‚Äì not). Since this is common I didn't think anything of it...
* Approx 3 days later, however, I notice 3 tiny scabs on the area where my I cut, had the brushburn. Never had scabs like that down there before....The scabs remain for a few days, don't really change, and it does NOT HURT at this point. Since the scabs were 3 tiny little circles, however, I got suspicious ‚Äì Didn't look like how you'd expect a brush-burn scab to look like when you scraped your knee at the park.
* Go to sexual health doctor where I get my normal STI screenings and PrEP. This place is legit and they offer Primary Care too. The doctor says it does NOT look like herpes and so she runs tests for everything else.... Everything Negative.
* OK. Life as usual. Couple days later, the scabs come off. Looks like some lowkey scar tissue, as expected under any scab. STILL NO PAIN.
* Now, I get suspicious though because like, the circles are just so circular....(lmfao) I'm like, this has to be some sort of infection; cuts don't look like that. So, thinking it was an infection, I made an effort to like thoroughly clean it in the shower, since I was more delicate before because I didn't want to rip the scabs off prematurely.
* THIS IS WHERE THE PAIN STARTS. Idk if my charcoal body wash irritated the wounds, but from here on, it HURTS. This is like an entire week after the first onset of the tiny scabs before it even begins to hurt. Upon cleaning the area, it went from what looked like a healthy, healing scar to a pissed-off open sore. Fuck. 
* The original 3 pissed-off open sores open up a Satellite Sore near the head of my penis now. Much smaller, and the new one actually doesn't hurt. This is where I figure this has to be herpes. That is not normal of a brush-burn to spread like that. The sores hurt at this point, kind of firey/tingly like a cold sore. I figure, yep, it's herpes...
* so I go BACK to the doctor to be sure and get the proper test done while the sores are there. He digs the cotton swab in my sores and it fucking HURTS like he's poking a hot needle in my dick. He's like ""Yeah this is a special type of cotton that is really good at picking up viral material. If you have H, it'll show"".
* Waiting my results, I kept the sores under vaseline because IDK what to do. However, EVERY TIME I CLEAN THEM, THE SORES OPEN UP AND SOME YELLOWISH FLUID COMES OUT for like 15 min or so until I'm completely air dried. At this point I'm like completely certain I have herpes, and although it's tricky/stressful to think about disclosure and everything, I'm honestly just accepting that I have it. Life goes on, my past has literally GEARED ME UP for this.
* **MY SWAB RESULTS COME BACK NEGATIVE** !?!?!?!
* I am literally just confused. I know herpes sucks, I know HSV and all its variants suck, and some people's cases are more serious. But, we also know that soo many people have it and pass it on having no idea. I'm just sitting here like...SO DO I HAVE IT OR NOT? But more importantly, since I don't have a super straight answer, do I disclose this entire novel to potential partners?!? LMFAO ‚Äì This roller coaster of a skin rash y'all. 

Please do not take my 'lmao's as anything but my own self-coping mechanism after having thought/known/idk that I have herpes for the past 5 years. And after all this recent stuff I felt so sure, But then a negative result from the open sores.

What do you guys think about the sequence of my symptoms?

I had no pain/signs/inklings before the first small scabs showed up. Normally before getting a cold sore, I feel it coming on the day before. Didn't get that sensation this time. But ever since I broke them open cleaning in the shower, it has this familiarly firey tingly feeling which is what made me assume it must be herpes. And the fact that the one little guy showed up later...

&#x200B;

Leave this all behind me and live life as normal until I have 100% confirmation? Or what do y'all think?

&#x200B;

TLDR: 5 years on the herpes psychological coaster includes a misdiagnosis, and now very confusing symptoms. Debating if I should just save this post as a draft in my emails and send it to potential partners as my disclosure?

tnl11l,"How to tell if cold sore, pimple or angular cheilitis? I‚Äôm prone to angular cheilitis/cracked corners of my lips, and last night made a comment about one of the corners of my mouth feeling sore/cracked after drinking less water than usual and wearing a mask all week. I slathered some lip balm on it and went on with my life. About an hour later I felt a bump on the border of my lip right beside the corner (but not in the exact corner, on bottom lip right beside the corner) that had developed a small white head and felt painful, with red around it. 

Last time something like this happened was 3-4 years ago and I just assumed it was a pimple. I popped it/picked at it and it turned into a scab on the edge of my mouth and I remember complaining that it looked like I had a cold sore. From what I remember, the scab mostly affected the skin outside my lip and honestly didn‚Äôt look any different than a pimples I‚Äôve picked at on other parts of my body. But I know now that HSV-1 is way more common than I realized and that for a lot of people, cold sores really do look just like pimples. 

It currently just looks like a big pimple, it‚Äôs a bit sore but pimples also hurt! There was no numbness/tingling/itching/symptoms in the days leading up, but once I started thinking it could be a cold sore I started to feel those things, but I have anxiety and have given myself fake symptoms before when I‚Äôve been paranoid about specific conditions. 

Any advice would be appreciated, since it could be 3 things and only one of them is highly contagious. I‚Äôm also nervous because if this is a cold sore, then the pimple from 3 years ago was probably also a cold sore. I‚Äôve had a few different sexual partners since then (never during the period there was anything on my mouth) that I never disclosed HSV status to, because I didn‚Äôt know that what it (possibly) was.

tnire3,"My new boyfriend gave me HSV 2 I started feeling symptoms a few days ago I thought it was a vaginal tear at first. The blister were from just recently shaving and ingrown hair. Which I normally do get a bit off. 

My boyfriend 22M And Me 19F 
We just started dating about a weak or so. We did moves pretty quickly to having sex. I knew I was clean before this cause I recently got tested also in late February and haven‚Äôt had unprotected sex since. Until it was with him. So when I started to feel the symptoms I told him to get tested again but specifically for Hsv 1 & 2. Cause I noticed on his tested paper before that those were the exact ones missing. Which I found very odd. But he said he didn‚Äôt know cause he told his doctor for everything and he thought they did and the lab apparently made a mistake. 
We‚Äôll come to find out yesterday he tested positive. I was shocked but I didn‚Äôt know what to do. He was worried I was going to hate him and leave him because of it. But I mostly just brushed it off and said we now just stuck with each other. Besides me finding out he gave me hsv. He‚Äôs a really sweet loving and caring guy and has been the best since the relationship started. We both have met each other‚Äôs parents and hang out almost everyday before or after work.

Well I still don‚Äôt know how to feel about finding out I have this. And I live in a really small city. Where everyone talks about everyone business and we don‚Äôt want it spreading that we have something like this. Because we will both just be viewed badly. We agreed to hide it from everyone. And just stick to ourselves.

I also told him. How I have no healthcare insurance. He will have to pay for my medication expenses for a while.And take me to get treated because my symptoms are becoming very annoying and painful.

I have done some research to understand more about this. But I still need all the information I can get. 

So for anyone that is a carrier for HSV 2 can you let me know as much information I need to know for someone who just got it and is pretty new to it.

Hi
I‚Äôm a male 23
So just a brief history about 5 years ago I got circumcised and a few days during my recovery I started developing some small itchy clustered rash on the tip of my penis and i was told it‚Äôs herpes. The doctor didn‚Äôt conduct any tests. She just looked at and said it‚Äôs herpes. She gave me some meds for the itching and sent me on my merry way. I wasn‚Äôt even counciled on how to live with it. Anyway long story short after that it cleared and I‚Äôve been fine 

But starting last year I developed a lump in my groin area on the upper right area between my testicles and thigh which was painful and not going away. I saw a series of doctors starting from a general doctor who was no help at all then moved to a dermatologist and now 
I‚Äôve been having issues with lump like boils appearing all over my groin area I saw a dermatologist and he treated me with antibiotics for a month and some cream 
But it didn‚Äôt help. And he seems to be clueless on what it could be. He then told me we have to collect puss from the boils but the problem is the boils aren‚Äôt releasing any puss. So he literally told me there‚Äôs nothing he can do until the puss starts coming out. And I observed that it seems to get disturbed if I masterbate. Idk if there‚Äôs any relation between the two or not.

I agreed that I would see her again to see where things go. I requested she start taking medication which she had no problem with. 

I‚Äôm a little nervous about potentially catching HSV2. I already have HSV1. (I disclosed this to her) It just seems so nonchalant to have oral herpes but if you have genital herpes people act like it‚Äôs the end of the world.

tmuvar,"How to talk about false positives? Hey all.

I wanted to ask about something that I haven‚Äôt really seen discussed, both on this subreddit and on the internet, generally.

Some personal history: last year, I underwent STD testing for the first time and received a surprise low positive of 1.47. A follow-up test came back with a second low positive of 1.51. I followed up with a Western Blot‚Ä¶which came back indeterminate (yay). I‚Äôve never had an outbreak and have had an exclusive partner for 7 years (who has consistently tested negative).

Recently, I decided I wanted answers and got in touch with Westover, who offered to help me redo the Western Blot. As I suspected and as available resources have led me to believe, Terri‚Äôs opinion was that protein(s) in my blood have triggered false positives. With that said, she also told me that people who receive false positives (and/or indeterminate WB results) will typically *continue* to receive false positives simply due to their body chemistry.

tmtcr4,"Equivocal Hi all, 

I've been dating my boyfriend for around 5 months. He disclosed himself as positive to me before we ever were sexual and when I pressed for more information, said that he was given an igH test after seeing a very small red bump that did not blister on his shaft prior. I forgot the value of this test but it was borderline, essentially equivocal. Two doctors other than the one who administered the IgH said that they didn't think it was herpes. He still went on antivirals, I don't go down on him, and we always use a condom. None of his former partners tested positive for herpes. We waited a while to have sex because I was so anxious. I feel horrible for putting that stigma on him but I couldn't really help it. Honestly, I wish he did not tell me. He recently got a iGG test 8 months after his suspected infection. It was equivocal at 1.06. He had mono at the time his blood was drawn which is a form of herpes virus. The AHA says that this should be considered negative (under 1.1) and his doctor said to use protection like normal but that we're basically in the clear. The anxiety over this has been the number one negative in our relationship. Can we let it go now? The stress is killing me and someone who I love very much. Should he get the western blot?

tm48wt,"Anxiety a year later. Hello everyone, a year ago I had sex for the first time and my then partner didn't disclose to me that he had oral HSV. I had a first outbreak and it has been the most painful thing in my life so far. So I'm quite traumatized still.

It's been a year and said partner and I are no longer together, but I am so anxious about guys showing interest in me. I am okay with the information that I've gotten about how to take care of myself to prevent outbreaks and I really don't think it should be as stigmatized as it is. But no matter what I think, it is, and I am so scared of trying something with someone, disclosing it, having sex and then them having to go through the same pain I went through.

I have so much fear around seeing anyone new because I know I will have to explain myself AND not only that, I am now scared shitless of any other STD. I feel like I don't want anyone coming close to me ever again.

I am so sad that I am young and I have not really enjoyed a normal and fun dating life because my first time, which I was so excited about and thought was safe, had this as a consequence.

If you've gone through this for a longer time than I have, please share any useful advice or experiences.

tmabkt,"First time swingers who caught herpes My husband (37m)and I (36f)are both happily married and have been together for 18 years. 
We've been monogamous to one another besides the consensual 3 some on 1 occasion, several several years prior to this event.

We just recently joined the swingers lifestyle; having been acquainted with only female hookups,  we ventured into swapping with other couples.  
We did go into this lifestyle again with a preconceived understanding that we could ""vet"" our couples on how trustworthy their word was when we asked how ""clean"" they've been. Very naive of us. 

We had our first full swap, again without hard evidence of ""clear"" STI panel on Feb 6th.  We met up with them again on Feb 25th again for another full swap. ( all unprotected )

We met another couple and had a full swap, unprotected, on March 6th, 1 week after our last encounter.  Fast forward 5 days later my husband has his first initial GHSV OB. The female half of our last encounter then has a visible OHSV outbreak a couple days later, and after questioning she's had ""cold sores"" for awhile.

My question to you guys, through the countless hours of reading testimonials on here.  How likely is it that my husband picked this up from couple 2 than couple 1.  The time frame from last potential exposure to initial outbreak was 5 days. Can someone with OHSV be contagious a week prior to their own OB and not on daily anti virals?

 I'm not here for anyone's judgment to be casted on us on our lifestyle and we should've known better, I'm here to get opinions and insights from people who have lived through this and are living through this.

I do know the stereotypical statement of it can lay dormant, but it's too coincidental, from us having unprotected sex to the female having cold sores to have come from a dormant virus.

Someone give us some insight please. 

FYI we have proceeded to stop our swinger profile completely and step away from the lifestyle.  This is not something we wish to give by means to anyone else and now a decision we both will live with together.",13,4,2022-03-24 09:32:38-04:00,first time swinger caught herp husband mand fare happili marri togeth year weve monogam one anoth besid consensu occas sever sever year prior event recent join swinger lifestyl acquaint femal hookup ventur swap coupl go lifestyl preconceiv understand could vet coupl trustworthi word ask clean theyv naiv us first full swap without hard evid clear sti panel feb th met feb th anoth full swap unprotect met anoth coupl full swap unprotect march th week last encount fast forward day late husband first initi ghsv ob femal half last encount visibl ohsv outbreak coupl day late question she cold sore awhil question guy countless hour read testimoni like husband pick coupl coupl time frame last potenti exposur initi outbreak day someon ohsv contagi week prior ob daili anti viral im anyon judgment cast us lifestyl shouldv known good im get opinion insight peopl live live know stereotyp statement lay dormant coincident us unprotect sex femal cold sore come dormant viru someon give us insight pleas fyi proceed stop swinger profil complet step away lifestyl someth wish give mean anyon els decis live togeth,"Sentiment(polarity=0.03721941638608303, subjectivity=0.44367283950617276)",0.03721941638608303,nuetral
tn7029,"IGG Questions after exposure Hi All, hope some of you can help me.  I had protected oral and vaginal sex with a prostitute 2/27.  I also of course like a dummy was kissing this person just so you know the background.  I think I saw something on her lip as well.  I believe a couple days after I got the same looking thing on my lip.  Nothing aggressive looking but a spot on the lip nonetheless.

Just FYI I have had HSV1 since I was very young (so im assuming its Oral).  I was never diagnosed with a swab or anything though.  A couple days after the incident above I was just not feeling myself (extreme fatigue, kind of fog like thinking, blurry vision etc, and I think I also got sick).  The tip of my dick has also been sore on and off since as well.  Also I got a shot of Rocephin on 3/2 and my doc gave me Azithromycin 2000 mg one dose on 3/4 just to be safe.

I was tested for all STDs on 3/2, 3 days after exposure (just positive with HSV1 IGG at 30.80).  Tested 3/16 (tested positive with HSV1 IGG at 30.80 again).  Tested 3/23 and now positive with HSV1 but my HSV1 went up to 32.80.   I just got the results.

I guess my question for all you experts here, are 

1, is 24 days post exposure truly too early to have a decently accurate result for HSV2.

2, The fact that I got the same looking thing on my lip, my worry is she had OHSV2 and transferred it to me thru kissing.  I know its rare, but if she went down on a guy before me with GHSV2, transferred it to her mouth and then kissed me, its possible right?  

3, is the fact my results were 30.80, 30.80, and now 32.80 for HSV1 have any indication on a new HSV2 infection or are they completely unrelated?

tn49kb,"Trip Advice Please - 25M, OHSV1, GHSV2 Hello All, I‚Äôm a 25yo male that was diagnosed with Oral1 and Gen2 in Sept.2021 from and interaction during vacation in Miami July.2021.

I‚Äôve just been so down since, to say the least, that I‚Äôve cancelled or avoided all trips big or small and even local night outs. 

This upcoming trip however the flights are non refundable so I‚Äôm using that as an excuse to try to get out and live a little again.

I‚Äôve kept my diagnosis to myself except for a long distance friend and have worked from home majority of the past few months. Only times I go out consistently are to the office or gym. 

But because I‚Äôve had little experience with the virus outside my own bubble, I‚Äôve never had to disclose or prepare for possible intimate interactions. Meaning idk how to disclose or what transmission rates are depending on different acts. 

Im fairly worried for this upcoming trip this weekend will present possible opportunities to be physically intimate again. 

I‚Äôve tried to educate myself but a single google is already extremely convoluted, contradictory and not to mention discouraging and fear generating. 

This group has been my best resource so I‚Äôd greatly appreciate just any general advice about preparing for such a trip or for these things in general regardless of location or vacation. 

For example, what if I receive oral sex, what are the transmission rate or implications of the person performing on me? Like is the performer guaranteed to contract? Also, If they perform oral on GHSV2 and then we kiss, will my OHSV1 turn into OHSV2? What‚Äôs the transmission rate of me performing oral to a females genitals? Will performing oral flare my OHSV1 and cause a breakout as well? I‚Äôm unaware of transmission during inter course as well. 

Apologies if these are dumb questions I‚Äôm really not well educated enough on this and that‚Äôs probably why I contracted in the first place. 

Huge thanks in advance for any tips big or small about anything. Or even resources.

tmg2q9,"HSV-1 Confirmed: Only Ever get One Blister, Is this Normal? Hello!

&#x200B;

So I am HSV-1 confirmed. I contracted it about 6 months ago for the first time. When I got it, I got ONE blister on the inside of my lip. But, it was a major blister, and super painful. It also affected the right half of my tongue, and the right half of my upper gums. My tongue would burn and get inflamed taste buds, and my gums were extremely swollen and burned.  It took a couple weeks to go away and man, the pain.

&#x200B;

Anyway, I'm curious if anyone else experiences HSV-1 this way? From what I've seen, they're usually clustered blisters on the outer edge of the lips. Mine expresses itself as a single blister in the same spot on the inside of my lip.

One more thing, I don't feel like I've gotten a break since my original infection. Over the past 6 months it feels like it's only a week and then it tries its best to reappear. I take Valaciclovir whenever I feel a new blister pop up to combat it and it usually prevents it from getting any worse. But dang, any relief? And how can I best help my immune system to build up protection? I'm not sure if how I take the antiviral is effective or could be negatively impacting my ability to build resistance.

Reddit:
If you are uncomfortable reaching me on TikTok or my instagram I can be reached on reddit I have a page dedicated to herpes (it was the first place I posted my story) Mylovelyladylumps6

r/herpes: subreddit is a useful tool to ask questions and connect with others who also have herpes. There are many positive outlooks as well as tips and tricks to dealing with herpes. HOWEVER do tread with caution the subreddit occasionally gets depressing and people do end up wallowing in self pity on there a lot. There are also occasionally posts about how it is unnecessary to disclose to partners which I DO NOT agree with. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/HSVpositive/ is a supportive non judgmental community for people living with herpes (hsv-1 or hsv-2).

https://www.reddit.com/r/HSV_r4r/ this subreddit is for social and dating purposes. It's brand new and worth a shot for people who are fed up with positive singles or not ready to disclose to a non herpes person. It is literally brand spanking new so I have no opinion on it yet but I am hopeful that it will be great. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/HSV_r4r/:  seems to be a place for people with hsv to form connections. Basically a bunch of singles looking. 

r/HerpesCureResearch: this subreddit is dedicated to information about the cure and other herpes research progress. It is extremely interesting however do not fall down the rabbit hole and hyper focus on the cure. There is no telling if the cure will be successful or will work for both types, or even be available to the public right away. It is definitely interesting to look at but sometimes people will sit around and wait to start dating until the cure comes out that that is not the best tactic. 

r/HerpesPersonals & r/Herpes Dating: these subreddits are more for herpes meetups and people looking to date or friends in a similar herpes situation. 

r/HerpesPics: this subreddit is NSFW and is basically a place to post a questionable sore. Whether it's to figure out a diagnosis or if something is a razor bump or an outbreak. WARNING THERE ARE PICTURES OF HERPES HERE. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimsWithHSV/ : A community for Muslims diagnosed with HSV (herpes simplex virus) to be able to connect and find support from fellow Muslims who are also facing the struggle of having this condition. Herpes is not a topic that you can talk to your friends and family about, especially as Muslims. So, it can be incredibly lonely at times. However, this subreddit, proves that you are not alone and is a place where you can find advice and support that you need as well as where you can offer it to others.

Dating Websites:
Positive Singles: this dating APP is catered to people with STIs (mainly herpes, hpv, HIV & AIDS). You can make it as private as you like by not posting anything but a bio until you decide to reveal photos of yourself to another person or you can set it up like a regular dating app. The cool thing about the app is that everyone on there has something so disclosing isn‚Äôt nearly as stressful. 
Things I personally did not like:
A lot of the features required you to pay for the app
Anyone from anywhere and any age can message you so it is hard to weed out who you want to talk to 
It seems easy to trauma bond on there if you and the other person were both recently diagnosed (so be careful and don‚Äôt settle for anything less than you deserve!)

2. HSV Dating on Facebook: this Facebook group has over 4 thousand members and is not a support group but a way to romantically meet people with hsv. Mission Statement:NOT A SUPPORT GROUP This group is a safe place for those 18+ years old navigating the HSV+ dating world by allowing us to get to know one another in a group setting. This group is all inclusive for all types of dating.May you find what you are looking for in a partner! https://www.facebook.com/groups/358851731762247/?ref=share

3. LGBTQIA üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà Herpes Support & Dating Group: This is a private group for members of the HSV/HPV community who identify as LGBTQ. This Group will not appear anywhere on your profile, and only those within the group can see who the members are and what is posted. No new profiles will be accepted. Over 600 members here! https://www.facebook.com/groups/386952082056743/?ref=share

Lil Diky: Gave an interview attacking the herpes stigma. I personally thought it was great that a celebrity was using their platform. Other people did not like the fact that he reiterated that he did not have it multiple times. But baby steps (in my opinion) are better than nothing.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKKdo8FXsA

tmr7xf,"Inoculating myself Hi! Have had GSV2 for a year. I know you build up antibodies that makes it unlikely that you will have it both orally and genitally. I have a tendency to bite my lips a lot (until they bleed) and also love giving my boyfriend oral. Am I way more likely to give it to myself orally if I have an open cut on my lips? Or does the antibody thing still apply?


UPDATE FROM TERRI WARREN:

‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you asked. The cut doesn‚Äôt make it more likely that you would acquire HSV 2 orally, no. If you were diagnosed last year, and he is also infected with HSV 2, your infection is well established and if I were you, I would take this off my worry list. If by some rare circumstance, you did acquire this orally, it would look just like a cold sore and likely not recur. Enjoy your sexual relationship and try not to be concerned about this.

However, a few days ago the depression started to creep up and I‚Äôm feeling pretty down about this and how it will affect my life in the future and my future love life.

It really doesn‚Äôt help that my giver isn‚Äôt giving me the best support throughout this and I know I shouldn‚Äôt expect anything from anybody‚Ä¶ but maybe a little compassion for giving me something that‚Äôs for life would be nice‚Ä¶. We were just starting to get to know each other and I made the mistake of getting too drunk one night and allowing myself to have unprotected sex without asking his sexual history. I have several friends with STIs so I am very adamant about practicing safe sex. 

This whole situation has been really awkward and I‚Äôm trying to navigate through it day by day, but he is truly pissing me off with the way he is handling this. If anything I‚Äôve been more supportive of him being devastated that he did this to me. He ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt know‚Äù his status, so this wasn‚Äôt anything intentional. I just feel like I‚Äôm comforting him more for his feelings than I‚Äôm being comforted for mine and it‚Äôs a little annoying. 

I maybe could see a future with us, because he seemed like a great person before all of this, but a part of me also feels like maybe I should hate him for the way he is handling this. Not for doing this to me, but for his lack of effort and compassion. 

We‚Äôve rarely spoken since he came back and confirmed he was positive, which means he was indeed the one who gifted this to me. The few words we‚Äôve exchanged was him saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt blame you if you hate me forever. I don‚Äôt deserve how nice you are. I hate myself for this.‚Äù And I‚Äôm just over here coddling his a**. It‚Äôs actually kind of embarrassing for me to go back and read, because it‚Äôs been over a week now and not once has he tried to check in and make sure I‚Äôm okay. 

It‚Äôs not that I ever need that from him, because regardless I‚Äôm going to be okay and fight through this‚Ä¶. But damn I think common sense would be to be here for me. A part of me just wants to block him and not worry about if I ever hear from him again. I just don‚Äôt even know.

I‚Äôve done so much research and saw that there‚Äôs like a 2% chance lip filler can cause herpes reactivation and usually it‚Äôs HSV-1 but I think my issues have been traced back to the filler because I never even noticed I had it until then.

I‚Äôm so nervous about sending a message. I really like him. I‚Äôm 99.9% sure it had to be him that gave me HSV-2, I was screened for STI‚Äôs before I slept with him, and I have only had sex with him since (unprotectedüò∂). 

FYI - I have only ever slept with him unprotected, I haven‚Äôt had sex with anyone else for months. He was having unprotected sex with another person the same time he was sleeping with me, and didn‚Äôt tell me. Over a week after I slept with him I started experiencing all the symptoms, sores, fevers, body aches etc. 

Is this a good msg to send to him? 

‚ÄúSo I went to have an STI check and it came back positive for HSV-2 (herpes). I‚Äôve only slept with you since I was last screened, so maybe you should get checked too. I have mild symptoms, you could be asymptomatic, which is maybe why you didn‚Äôt know. I‚Äôve done a lot of research and from what I‚Äôve read, it‚Äôs actually just more like a rash that comes and goes, shouldn‚Äôt impact sex or anything, but the stigma around the STI is the worst part. This isn‚Äôt ideal, and It does suck, especially because I‚Äôve never had an STI before. Lowkey freaking out, but I‚Äôm hoping we can talk through this, and work it out together. Feel free to take some time, do some research, and let me know how you feel, and what you‚Äôre thinking when you‚Äôre ready.

Around 40 days after contact I noticed  2/3 bumps in pubic area after shaving, didn‚Äôt think anything of it because I just shaved. 

Shaved again 2 weeks after that and noticed the hard bumps turned into red blisters. These ‚Äúblisters‚Äù were not grouped together and scattered throughout pubic region. After like 2 weeks I popped one and only blood came out. Eventually scabbed over and went away. Now I still have 2 of the red bumps after like 35 days that look like they might be starting to scab over. I went to doctor and he said it looks like folliculitis to him. I am unsure tho because he seemed uneducated about herpes. 

To be safe I also got a IGG blood test at 11 weeks (I know 12 weeks is best) and was negative. 

I really feel like I probably have it because these symptoms are probably not just a coincidence after I was exposed to somebody with HSV2. Although, I feel like I‚Äôm stuck in limbo.

tlkhjs,"Support for Friend/My Anxiety About Herpes I have a close friend who has recently disclosed to me that their partner for about a year has herpes. I didn‚Äôt ask any details about strain etc as I just wanted to just be supportive of their decision to stay with this person since they knew it was serious and was willing to take the risk. This person is notorious for not using protection and I have made comments about this with other partners but ultimately it‚Äôs not up to me to change their behavior. However I do think there‚Äôs a self esteem issue at work here. 

A few months have gone by and I have felt a growing anxiety about my exposure to the virus as this friend continually asks to share drinks, vapes and chapstick. We are very close and I feel like putting up this boundary with them will alienate them further and I‚Äôm not even sure if they have it! But I‚Äôve been wiping off my vape after I share and making more excuses for sharing drinks etc because I really don‚Äôt want to expose myself and not sure if this friend will share the info with me if they find out they too have herpes. 

I‚Äôm married and I shared this information with my partner to get some insight and they are very adamant that I stop sharing saliva with this friend no matter how difficult the conversation.

I want to be supportive and caring because I love this friend but I historically am not great at putting up boundaries and am struggling to even imagine the words coming out of my mouth without sounding judgmental. This friend is sensitive and has since ended their relationship with this person and has had another sexual partner since then and hasn‚Äôt been tested as far as I know. So I know I can‚Äôt really trust her decision-making on this matter. 

While I have so much to say about their choices I know I can only control what I do and say and for me that is telling a friend that for my own comfort I would prefer not to share vapes etc in order to limit the risk for myself and my partner. 

I‚Äôve done a good amount of research and I‚Äôd like to avoid flat out asking if this friend has contracted the virus as that is up to them to find out and share with me if they wish. I also know that the likelihood of getting it from them is minimal but still possible when we‚Äôre both slobbering over the same vape pen and chapstick.

tkx32j,"update 34 yo female HSV2+ Valtrex anyone? Last week I wrote about my diagnosis from a bitter and angry mental place. I've since done a lot of reading in this forum, spoken with a friend who has had HSV-2 for 12 years, my friend and ex boyfriend who is a molecular biologist analyzed STD panels for his job and my sister. I'm very lucky to have such a knowledgeable and supportive group of people around me! My friend talked to me about her outbreaks and what it's been like dating with it. She told me to always be upfront with men before any sexual contact and to give them a day to think on it and do their own research before moving forward. She is also a mother of a healthy beautiful girl, which gives me hope for the future.

My ex very patiently listed the statistics around HSV and told me I shouldn't dwell on who gave it to me. He recently contracted HSV1 from his current girlfriend and we laughed a little about the irony. This is a bit controversial and something I need to do more research on, but he told me he didn't want me to take the antiviral every day and only to take it when I felt the tingly of an outbreak. He said it's less effective later in life and I could experience bad side effects from taking it every day. Some context: we broke up years ago, but are still close friends and share a love of hiking, backpacking and caving.

My sister said, what's the big deal? I got HSV1 from the kindergartens kids I work with! More reason to make men respect you and wear protection! 

Lucky me for my support group! ‚ô•Ô∏è Not a word about the fact that I used to be a sex worker. Nothing about how I haven't been married or in a relationship longer than six years. They all told me they loved me at the end of our conversation. I'm happy crying! I know I won't get this positive of a reaction from everyone. That's fine and the people who will look down on me aren't the kind of people I want in my life. I can use this as a filter for people who want to be with me for the person I am and keep people out of my life who look for excuses to judge and look down on others.

tljpqi,"Just a little rant So, a week and a half ago I started getting painful sores, a fever, and many other awful symptoms. Anyways, I decided to go get tested. After the most painful pelvic exam because I was so inflammed and had so many open sores, all the doctor said was it looks like herpes and sent me to go get blood tested for other stds.

Later that day I got a notification from my pharmacy that I had medication to pick up and so I went and got it, it was Valacyclovir so I started taking that based on the pharmasists instructions.

A few days later, I get my results back. Turns out they put my swab in an expired container so they could not perform the test. I got a bunch of negatives on my blood test though. The clinic said I could come back and get a new test with no charge. However, they were out of swabs so I'd have to wait but I couldn't because I was home on spring break from uni.

Anyways, today I went to another clinic to get tested again. I called yesterday and they said they'd just perform a blood test since I'm on medication and my sores are almost all healed. I get in and talk to the doctor. She says that they don't do blood tests for hsv and exained why. She said I'll just have to wait until my next ob and then I'd come in to get a swab done.

I'm so upset because I just want an answer! Right now I'm just assuming I have herpes based on what the first doctor said. And I'm mad at her because all she said to me was ""looks like herpes but we'll see with this swab for sure"" and then sent me to get blood drawn!

tlif3c,"Besides shortenings outbreaks, what is the benefit to taking Valcyclovir or other antivirals? Hello all,

Recently diagnosed with gHSV-1 via swab. Had my first outbreak about 3ish weeks ago.  Because I was diagnosed about a week into the outbreak, I was prescribed Valcryclovir but didn‚Äôt end up taking it because the doctor said it wouldn‚Äôt help at that point.  I also read that some people say it‚Äôs good to not take antivirals for the first outbreak.

My question is:
Besides helping outbreaks clear faster, is there any benefit to taking antivirals? I understand that if you take it daily it can help eliminate outbreaks all together, but is there a benefit if you‚Äôre only taking them during an OB?  Does it help you not have another OB for a longer amount of time?  Just need a rundown on it I guess.

Can I get opinions on this timeline, is it likely he cheated or could it be the test he took when we first dated was too soon to when he slept with others (unsure of when he slept with others)? 

I do think it's odd that it's taken til now for me to have an outbreak if he didn't cheat.. 9 months in..

For some context, before the one time I had sex with another guy (1.5 months before dating this one) I did not have sex for three years and got screened multiple times during this period of no sex, to be safe and also because I do have a fear of stds. 

I understand the stigma behind stds but I have extremely low self confidence. It seems there's always something about me for someone not to like. 

I'm pretty scared and heartbroken.

I had some common sense and didn't kiss her for the next week . of course I got herpies one month after, I didn't kiss her, maybe we should have waited a bit longer, maybe I get them even earlier, maybe she gave me a cup that she used before dunno

she has naver told me before that she has herpies. When I became infected, she told me that she had cold sores once in primary/secondary school and she was young back then and had no idea what was that. Her mother has this shit regullary so I guess she knows :/

We are together for 5 months, and she has never mentioned and she has oral herpes

I don't know what to think, for me it just sounds ridiculous. She said it is not that is not a big deal and I don't have to worry about it. It seems for me so selfish or extreamly irresposible and stupid to spread fucking herpes on someone's face

I am worried as fuck. I cannot get rid of this virus and also cannot break up, I am not going to find another girl with this shit on my mouth and I don't want to spread this shit on someone else

tksc14,"Casual Contact Activities‚Ä¶ Am I Fine or At Risk? Good Morning Everyone!

I hope you‚Äôre all doing well. Thank you for the sheer amount of information, love and support that you all provide to strangers that you do not even know.

[updated w/ additional info: my friend left on Tuesday. On Wednesday morning, I woke up with a sore throat that persisted the entire day. On Thursday morning, I woke up with a slightly better sore throat and a slightly more prominent cough and mid/upper back aches. Besides rubbing her back twice and possibly touching the red spots that did not look like blisters, I am confident that I didn‚Äôt have any other exposure to her skin long-term that I would categorize as more than you‚Äôd get from a coworker.]

In January, my friend was diagnosed with GHSV. I‚Äôm not exactly sure if she has Type I or Type II down there, but I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs Type II. Anyway, she is here to visit and she is on her period, something that I know can trigger or cause OBs, or at least asymptomatic shedding, according to what I‚Äôve read here. She takes daily antivirals (not sure exactly which ones, her prescribed dosage or how consistently, but I believe she does take them daily). I just wanted to know how likely transmission is in the below three scenarios. I would never want to make her feel uncomfortable or like our friendship has changed, because honestly, it hasn‚Äôt, so I don‚Äôt want to ask her and possibly offend her but I would still like to be knowledgeable about things that have stuck out to me and hasn‚Äôt left my mind. Considering that it has been less than the 3-4 full months needed for her to form sufficient antibodies and auto-inoculation is higher before this time AND she was on her period so maybe she had increased symptomatic shedding?????):

1. [updated to include] we shared food, and that‚Äôs something we‚Äôve always done and I don‚Äôt want to say no just because‚Ä¶.., but not utensils, so same plate, different forks and spoons. Is this a risk? Could she have somehow passed OHSV2 to me (she‚Äôs never mentioned oral symptoms) through this way? She complained of allergies, so maybe her immune system was already low.

2. Earlier in the day, my back was facing her and so I couldn‚Äôt see what she was about to do but she adjusted my (low cut, to the point where I had to go without undies) bottom by pulling it up quickly and slightly. To do this, her hand had to go behind the hem of my bottoms and of course, only my skin was there. This area is best describe as the top of my buttcrack/butt. She had used the bathroom earlier/recently and while I trust her to wash her hands thoroughly with soap each time, it‚Äôs not like I physically saw it to assume that. How likely would transmission be to this area of my body/me at all from this encounter? I know that the virus can live on hands/fingers if not properly washed and transferred and to healthy skin, it can do no harm but the top of my buttcrack is a different area I‚Äôm assuming since it would be considered the start of one of my private areas.


3. I offered to rub cream on my friend‚Äôs upper back because she couldn‚Äôt reach. She had, in anybody else what I would consider maybe 1-2 small back pimples or non-herpetic red, small spots, but because she has not passed the 3-4 month mark after her initial OB and self (or auto?)- inoculation could happen during this time and I do not know if it did‚Ä¶.. How likely is it that those could‚Äôve been herpetic lesions and I could get herpetic whitlow from them? I have INTENSE peeling of my hands from over washing (pandemic + OCD caused). Additionally, how likely would it be for someone else to get it from any virus leftover on my hands if I was holding and caressing this other person‚Äôs hand for a good amount of time? This person has new, pink skin over recent cuts and scrapes, but the cuts and scrapes themselves are not new. The scabs have formed and in most, if not all cases, already fallen off and the skin underneath is pink (on it‚Äôs way to being fully healed).

I really hope not to offend anybody but like I said, these stuck out to me over the time that she was/is here. Especially now that I have a sore throat, couch and (what really is making me nervous, mid-back aches!!). Thank you for your responses!

TL;DR: Can I get OHSV2 from my friend if we shared food (same plate, different utensils)? She was sick (thought it was allergies but maybe not‚Ä¶.) and now my throat is sore and I have a slight cough. She didn‚Äôt have any blisters or sores orally.


TL;DR#2: How likely is it for genital herpes to spread from (leftover virus that may be on) one person‚Äôs hands to another person if the first person adjusted the waist of the second person‚Äôs pants? 

TL;DR #3: How likely is it for genital herpes to cause herpetic whitlow or any other type of infection if Person B rubs Person A‚Äôs (with genital herpes) back where there are (could be pimples) small, red spots and has dry, peeling skin from over washing hands in general? How likely is it to cause herpetic whitlow of any other type of infection if Person B holds hands with Person C who has new skin over cuts and scrapes on hand but it is not technically open or fresh?

tkeblf,"Just diagnosed: In shock and feeling guilty My fianc√© and i were having threesomes with this woman for about a month. When she left town, she called us and expressed that she was having the worst pain in her genitals, with blisters, along with a sore throat and fever (I later learned this would be considered her first OB). I immediately got a blood panel, and while waiting for results thought back to if I could potentially have it and not have known. For years I have had ""recurring UTIs"" After reading up on how an OB can be mistaken for UTI symptoms, I knew that the test would come back positive, as it did. 

&#x200B;

My fianc√© has accepted it, but I am having the hardest time, and can't get over the ""who, what, when and how's"". At the age of 25, I think I've had it since my sophomore or junior year of college. I will never know if I passed it along to anyone, or who passed it to me. I feel guilty for passing it to the young woman. I'm relieved that I know what is, but a bit envious of those who will probably never get blood work, and will never know they have it. ignorance is absolute bliss. The envy is only there, because I feel really alone right now. I want someone to feel what I am feeling.

&#x200B;

This is absolute ramblings of my initial shock, but I hope I can move forward soon. Wallowing in my sadness will probably elevate my symptoms. I guess the first stage is acceptance, and the next stage is figuring out what triggers an OB for me. If I thought it was recurring UTIs all this time, I'm sure my sores are in my Urethra. I also hope to find something that relaxes me, as I've heard that helps.

tkmrvj,"Is it important to disclose your status as an HSV1+ person? So I have oral herpes type 1. I have a question about when I should disclose and Ill give some background before asking.

I got it as a kid. I don‚Äôt even remember how. Probably shared a water cup with an adult who had it. I had some outbreaks back then but I haven‚Äôt had an outbreak since, in maybe 15 years, not even when I was extremely stressed or in very harsh and dry weather. Yet my blood test still and forever will come back positive.

Ever since I got diagnosed at age 18 or 19 (before I didn‚Äôt know cold sores were herpes), I‚Äôve disclosed it to every person I‚Äôve dated. They‚Äôve always been okay with it or even told me I didn‚Äôt have to tell them. And actually none of them have gotten it, and they‚Äôve been multiple year long relationships. So I think the chances I give it to someone are extremely low, I mean despite kissing these girls for years, they never contracted it.

Should I disclose my status to hookups (like one time things)? Should I even disclose it to potential long term partners before kissing for the first time? I think with the latter I should, but I don‚Äôt know if I should with the former. I feel like disclosing it would kill any chance of something happening. And oral herpes is SOOO normal and common that it almost feels stupid‚Ä¶ but I don‚Äôt want to be an ass, or even worst, infect them‚Ä¶

PD: I know I‚Äôm lucky. I got it as a kid, and orally, which means I‚Äôm very unlikely to get the genital one.

But anyways....I think the whole expectation on people who know they have herpes is very unfair and doesn't do much besides make us less fuckable. It's also the fact that no one else is doing it but we are expected to because we happen to be educated. I've had 10+ sex partners of both genders and I know for a fact at least one of them had herpes but I was never disclosed to and honestly I don't think I should've been. I never asked if they had herpes so they weren't being dishonest to me even if they knew. Also statistically speaking 80-90% of people with genital herpes have no idea they have it so they are definitey not disclosing that they have it. The CDC doesn't even think it should be disclosed to the vast majority of people with herpes because they do not recommend testing for it unless there is an outbreak. Also nobody asks me ""hey have you ever had any STDs?"" I am the one who has to make that conversation and freak someone out who was seconds ago blissfully unaware that they could get an STD. And then I have to spend time correcting their ignorance. Someone thought I exposed them because we were cuddling with pants on. It's exhausting sometimes.

tkezmt,"Contagious Period with Acyclovir Hi all,

I get cold sores on my mouth and take acyclovir pills to stop the cold sore from progressing. This usually stops the cold sore completely so the skin remains normal or significantly minimizes it so the skin heals in less than a week.

Im wondering what the scientific understanding is for the contagious period when medication is taken. Since my skin is normal after, let's say, 5 days and any tingling has gone away,  am I no longer contagious or is viral shedding still occurring?

I personally am not entirely sure if I have it or not. And it‚Äôs been definitely destroying my state of mind. I can either find out for sure. End up having it. And risk the chance of falling into a deeper depression and taking my life if it gets that dark. 

Or I can treat live life like it was 100 years ago. and not hyper focus on every little body ailment. We live in a time where we can get on our little internet devices and hyper focus to such an unhealthy degree on potential health issues. I‚Äôve probably spent 20+ hours in the last 2 months reading endlessly. The same damn posts over and over again. For what ?!!!   A virus that 80-90% of people are asymptomatic with. 

I barely have sex. But if I find my self really liking someone. And I end up giving it to them. Well then I guess we‚Äôre meant to be at that point. But fuck. I can‚Äôt live my life hyper focusing. I want to be more carefree. And not treat my life like I live in a fuckin plastic bubble. And share my every little health record with everyone I meet. 

A lot of you make no progress in feeling better because Reddit and the internet becomes a stupid echo chamber of self pity. Im so fucking done with it. Many of us live in a time and place where life is too fucking comfortable. And it gives us way too much opportunity to be emotionally weak. And obsessed with dumb shit like this.

tk8b1j,"Just wondering if this at all sounds like herpes (20M)‚Ä¶ I had protected sex with a new partner a little over 2 months ago and 19 days after I started having some symptoms. I had a pretty bad tingling for around a week and a half, I was incessantly checking the spot and noticed some white dots on my penis, no pain just noticed them. I was icing and putting warm packs over my penis area during this as well. Around 2 weeks later I went to the doctor and they said I have a yeast infection and gave me clotrimazole to treat it. 

I still had some doubt but I would treat it as such, the white dots are still there over a month later with no change, however I started to have another tingling in my groin a couple weeks ago (7 weeks after sex) and started to put the clotrimazole on this area, the tingling quickly turned into a burning but still no sores or any blisters. Went to another doctor and they said I had jock itch but the spot where it burned wasn‚Äôt super red but I still put the clotrimazole for another week and the burning was on and off. I was still worried so I got a full std panel and came up negative for everything (including igg and igm even though it was only 8 weeks since potential exposure).

I am now having another tingling feeling on my inner thigh but haven‚Äôt seen any blisters or anything to suggest an outbreak. Could this be a reaction to the clotrimazole? (the doctor recommended I stopped using it yesterday). Is it possible to have all these symptoms without any sores? My symptoms are on and off, could it also be anxiety related? I‚Äôve never really been super focused on the feelings down there before now so it may be nothing. Just any change in feeling or look down there and I get anxiety about it.

tk2zep,"First oral HSV outbreak treatment advice Further to my last post, thus far I have developed no sign of genital herpes, though I have contracted it orally.

I've been horribly ill the last few days with fever, muscle weakness, light-headedness, incredibly sore and swollen gums to the point eating and drinking is really hard, bleeding gums, a really sore throat, and a near constant headache. The doctor thought it was an infection in my wisdom teeth so I've been on metronidazole, but I now know all these symptoms align with an oral outbreak.

Now that I know I'm hsv positive I have some questions:

1. How can I treat my symptoms, other than with painkillers?
2. Is it worth getting the sores swabbed to find out if it's type 1 or 2?
3. Does the fact I contracted it orally mean that I'm unlikely to develop it on my genitals too from the same exposure?
4. Going forward, are there antivirals or any other meds I can take to prevent shedding, and can I get these free from the clinic? (UK based)

Though I give one of them points for being somewhat honest.  As she told me she was sorry.  That I was a great guy before she ghosted me. I read so many success stories.  I call BS.  My shrink told me to go out each day and say hello to someone new.  This was 17 years ago.  People will keep encouraging me.  Tell me don't give up.   I as would they go out with someone like me.  they often side step the question.  Or they might as well live on the moon.  statistics show we are many?  so where are we?  Not until we demand a cure and not the CDC marketing plan for big Pharma.  Will people like me ever have a chance for real connection.  where are our advocates?  At least they could sue on our behalf for all the mental and emotional pain The CDC and big Pharma have caused in their need for big profit.

tjnw23,"Another is it HSV thread? I read tons in this community! Lots of helpful people here! I'm going to go by the rules guidelines. In asking my questions

 

* **What part of the body is involved? Mouth area, genital area, or some other area?**

Lip Line

* Where are your symptoms located *within* the above area?

Yup! 

* **What do your symptoms** ***look like?*** **Eg blisters, bumps, pimples, cuts, ulcers/lesions, a rash, chafing, etc? If blisters/bumps, how many are there? How big are they? If a rash, how big an area does it cover?**

It was ..weird, I came home from work and talking with my roommates, and then proceeded to adjust my mustache as all beard people do! Then felt something kinda bumpy. I check the mirror and It was a MASSIVE White head it seemed, alongside another tiny white head next to it. I SHOULD have taken a picture , I'm annoyed I didn't, I panicked and popped them but got distracted by someone calling my name I didn't even see what came out, I know, I got NOTHING for you guys to work on.

* **Do bumps appear to be solid or have liquid inside? If any liquid has come out, what color is it and what consistency does it have?**

I actually didn't get to see what came out, but I barely touched it and they popped. They left 2 tiny holes and scabbed within hours.

* **Are any physical sensations associated with your symptoms? Do they hurt or itch? Do they have any sensation when you are not touching them? What about when they are touched or rubbed?**

No sensations , no itching, no burning, nada. If I touch them I feel something, but nothing you wouldn't already experience messing with a pimple.

* **How long have your symptoms been there?**

I guess I've been monitoring it for 3 days?

* **Have they changed at all since they first appeared? If so, how?**

Scab, then fell off in the shower, this was roughly 2-3 days total.

* **Are you experiencing any other symptoms in addition to the visible ones on your mouth/genitals? Eg headache, fever, body aches, tingling sensation on the skin, etc? Do** ***not*** **just say that you have ""flu symptoms"" or ""flu-like symptoms"". Tell us the** ***specific symptoms*** **you mean by that.**

Nah, had canker sores, but I know HSV and they aren't related .

Please include any other information you think might be relevant.

The day after where one head, (I hope is a pimple) scabbed, I went nuts and squeezed it hard, and had clear oil come out. Made the area sting for a bit , then scabbed and I left it alone. Came off in the shower last night. 

I've always been sexually active, especially orally both up and down stairs of all sexes. So the idea of having HSV1 isn't really mind blowing, but since I have a partner of 5 years , If HSV decided to show it's face in my 30's then I wanna be safe. I would have gone to the doctor to swab, but there really isn't anything to swab..which makes me think it isn't HSV. 

TLDR Giraffe!

Got 2 BIG heads, they looked white/yellow . Didn't see what came out, because I was panicked. They scabbed after a day, I squeezed and pissed off one, oil came out it seems. No Tingling burning etc. Been checking pretty much every couple hours to see if there is any changes. Just seems like it's two normal pimples healing, but again I COULD BE WRONG! HSV 1 or 2, pictures are so frustrating to google! 

Are there any CLEAR ""yeah this is HSV"" or ""Yeah thats a pimple""

I've had 2 different partners in the past few months, and that's after having been married for a decade and being monogamous that entire time. I was finally able to see a new OBGYN, and got some swab and blood testing done.

Everything came back negative, including the swab testing, with the exception of HSV IgM.

tjso6j,"I think I may have herpes aka my fianc√© is cheating on me I am extremely worried I have herpes. I have been in a committed, 4 year relationship with my fianc√©. In the 4 years I‚Äôve dated I have never had an issue like this. 

Last Thursday I was rushing and wanted to shave a little bit down there. I used an old electric shaver we have and quickly ran it over two specific areas. I know it was sloppy and I felt it catch a few times but I ignored it. That area is very high friction for me and because of that, I have multiple skin tags (which were tested by my gyno) down there. So I know I cut some of them. I stupidly then put on bike shorts and immediately worked out for about an hour.

A few hours later I noticed that the area where I shaved had big, fleshy, red lumps with what looked like a cut/opening in the middle. It looks like some of them are cut/irritated skin tags, and I know I accidentally shaved one off. Since then, they‚Äôve calmed down and gotten smaller but some have formed tiny blisters and others look like open but healing sores. Like flat and white in the center. They look very similar to a lot of herpes pictures I‚Äôve seen. 

I‚Äôm terrified that my fianc√© cheated.

tjk9nt,"Please help, I‚Äôm so confused‚Ä¶ Sorry, This is extremely long but please read to fully understand.. 

So, to start, I was with my partner for 2 years and we broke up. We didn‚Äôt have sex for 3 months at least prior to the break up..after breaking up with him, I went back to my child‚Äôs father and we slept together (roughly) - fast forward 8 days, I started noticing bumps. My vagina was obviously torn from the roughness of the sex, but these bumps were not blisters and were not located in the inner area where the tears were. Plus, They never burst, never caused me any pain other than when i wiped at them and kind of palpated them to see what they were. They were around my clitoral/outer labial area and nowhere near the inner labia or vulva. I went in to get ‚Äúswabbed‚Äù because I popped what looked an ingrown hair and thought maybe it could be swabbed anyway. 7 days later, I get a positive IGG for herpes 1 and 2, index 1.5 for hsv2 and 1.1 for hsv1. The swab was negative. Tell child‚Äôs dad about this because I thought he gave it to me. He tested negative for hsv1&2 a week later. So now, I‚Äôm thinking wtf?, my ex boyfriend gave it to me?? He has not been tested and won‚Äôt because he hasn‚Äôt had any symptoms, which pisses me off. 

Anyway, this ‚Äúoutbreak‚Äù lasted all of 5 days MAX. Like the symptoms were over before I tested positive. and never ONCE did I experience a popped blister or painful urination in the vaginal area other than the first couple days after the rough sex due to tearing. I was prescribed Valtrex and when I tell you I reacted BADLY. SEVERE Back spasms, nausea and vomiting, horrible vertigo, etc. as soon as I stopped taking them at the end of the script, I stopped reacting.

So, I go get tested again, this is about the 3 week mark since the ‚Äúoutbreak‚Äù. This time I asked for another swab, a second IGG, and my doctor threw in a blood PCR test which I hear is useless, but whatever. PCR and swab came back negative, but IGG came back positive for hsv2, index 1.2 and hsv1 was equivocal right at 0.9 - weird, right?? 

So NOW, fast forward to a couple days ago I was ending  my period and those bumps appeared again, with itching and yeasty discharge. So I do a telehealth visit and they prescribe me yeast infection pill and Valtrex for 6 days worth. The bumps disappeared after I started the yeast pill but I am still taking the Valtrex just to be safe. I am so sick from it, it makes me wonder wtf I am even taking it for. 

So sorry for the long post, but WHAT THE HELL is going on? My doctor is not giving me any answers except ‚Äúyou definitely have a herpesvirus, but not sure what type/location, and just disclose to people you might have it.‚Äù MIGHT? Is there not a damn YES OR NO? Like what do I do???

tjetb1,"Chin HSV2 with a little panic So I'm sitting here working and my chin starts to itch. I have a beard and sometimes that happens so whatever. I scratch it. It just gets worse so I go check it out... 

A bunch of little clear blisters. 

Wtf. I have had HSV2 genital only for a couple years and this is new... 

What worries me is I rested my chin on my toddlers head multiple times this past week and gave them kisses, 2 or so days ago they put my beard comb in their mouth, and i put eye drops in their eyes all day yesterday and I wasnt being mindful and washing my hands every 5 seconds as I typically do. 

I take daily suppressants but we were sick all weekend and now I'm reeling going through every moment to see if there is any possibility I spread this to them, weighing probability, determining odds if it was there but no blisters yet. 

Fuck this virus man 

Edit from my crosspost: 

I'll obviously know if they get it within a few days but to help ease my mind until then does anyone have any resources on lesion development time or transmissibility? 

I started getting a sore throat yesterday so I assume I at least had a small red patch there. 

Super sore throat and blisters today. 

They put my beard comb in their mouth for half a second before I snagged it on Friday although I don't think I had used it any time right before they did that. 

I did give them forhead kisses yesterday and we snuggled all day Saturday with some chin resting on their hair.

tjfyio,"2nd outbreak in 30 days? Hi all. I had unprotected sex feb 15 with someone I was intimate with in the past, also unprotected, and was seen in the hospital feb 19 for what I thought was only MRSA on my leg and really painful (lower abdomen abs back pain) BV. I did also develop flu like symptoms and extreme muscle stiffness and weakness around the 17th of the month. When I went to the hospital I did have two bumps (looked like possible ingrown or MRSA) on my vulva and requested an std panel. The panel came back positive for BV, mGen, and although the doctor said my bumps did not look like herpes I had a white kind of mucousy discharge and so she gave me valacyclovir to be safe. I‚Äôve finished all of the antibiotics and antiviral 5 days ago and now I have the white mucous type discharge and tingling on my vulva along with this time a few small bumps. I WANT TO ADD THAT I HAD A HERPES BLOOD TEST IN JANUARY AND IT WAS NEGATIVE. so that is why I am a little confused as to what to really think of these symptoms I‚Äôm having because I would think if he‚Äôs had it and I‚Äôve slept with him in the past wouldn‚Äôt my test have been positive? I wanted to wait until the first week of April to go back to the doctor for a follow up or TOC swab for the mgen and blood test for herpes but would it make more sense to get the herpes blood test done now while I might be having a possible outbreak?

After dating a new person for a bit I started to have them regularly. It was a toxic relationship and it messed up my sleep so I blamed that. Since then I've been having regular breakouts and was assuming it was HSV-2 for that reason. The igg blood test showed positive for HSV-1 (50 igg) and negative for HSV-2. So I can be assured that it is HSV-1 I think, but I'm surprised I'm having such regular breakouts every 3-4 months.

We have internalized the idea that carrying this very common and *for the most part* benign virus makes us unloveable contagious freaks and we withdraw into ourselves. I question the usefulness of these spaces for depressed newly diagnosed folk when almost everybody else is lamenting and catastrophizing their condition. Instead of supporting and educating each other alot of times we are validating each others shame and inadvertently justifying the extremely overblown stigma placed on us. Don't get me wrong, I have learned alot and have benefitted immensely from this subreddit and other herpes communities but I think we should be careful about if what we are saying is productive or if we're fetishizing our own stigma and status. We are the ones who have to live with this virus we should be cultivating a space based on supporting, educating each other, debunking the stigma, and living a fulfilling life full of love and happiness.

As we all know, HSV-1 is also referred to as cold sores when we have it in the mouth. Curious about this scenario:

If I have HSV-1 but asymptomatic  and I kiss someone, this means that I am still likely to pass it to them, correct?

From my understanding of herpes, both HSV-1 and HSV-2 generally prefer ONE area of the body. So for instance if first point of contact is this one particular area (either mouth or genitals), the virus reoccurs in that particular body part only. Correct?

So, let's say I've passed it to them via mouth to mouth - this means the virus has been exposed to that specific area, therefore meaning that the body has already started building antibodies for the virus. Which means that if first point of contact is the mouth, they are not or less likely to get it on the genitals...? am I correct to say this?

This is taking into account gap in time between kissing and performing oral sex on partner, about a week or two.

In summary, my question is basically this:

I have HSV-1 but asymptomatic. Kissing partner on one occasion will have exposed them to the virus in the mouth and given body time to create antibodies. Does that mean that my partner would have developed a resistance towards the virus in the genitals (meaning they don't have HSV-1 in the genitals, just the mouth).

I had a two week long OB, calling out of work sick because I couldn‚Äôt relieve myself without screaming and crying from the pain. 

It‚Äôs been a wild ride. 

I‚Äôve learned a few things. 

- it doesn‚Äôt affect your relationships much. I‚Äôve had two boyfriends since my diagnosis, and they‚Äôve accepted me. 

- it is crucial to work on your self love.

- it‚Äôs a blessing and a curse. If someone turns you away because of your diagnosis, good riddance. Know your worth. You are much more than the stigma. 

- take your valtrex - I pop it occasionally when I‚Äôm sexually active & it helps relieve some of the anxiety if I feel any prodromal symptoms.

- a lot of people have it. Like, a lot. I know the data says so, but it‚Äôs different when you disclose and they say ‚Äúoh! I have that too‚Äù or ‚Äúyeah! Someone else I know has it‚Äù it really helped put it into perspective for me.

I kept scouring the internet for every scientific fact I could find. It was so panicked and desperate. 

When they confirmed what I already knew to be true, I crumbled.

titf7c,"Unsure if I really do have HSV-2 Hi so I got a general test for all sexually transmitted related things when I was 16 (because my parents found out I was sexually active, at this point I had only been intimate with 2 people) my results came back as inconclusive. Honestly it‚Äôs so long ago that I do not remember the exact numbers but I do know the test that detects recent infections was non reactive and the other one was a high inconclusive result. My parents, myself and my bf just concluded that I do have it. We all moved on.

But‚Ä¶.

I‚Äôm almost 21 now and I still have never experienced a single OB or other related symptoms to HSV-2. Around 6 months ago I made an appointment to test whether or not I do have it because I am aware that there are a LOT of inaccuracies with blood tests. 

I did the EIA test and received another ‚Äúgrey zone‚Äù result (1.05). I still am with the same person I was back then, therefore my body count is still at 2. I‚Äôve only kissed other people prior to that because I was still very young. I just find it extremely hard to believe that I do have herpes type 2. If I tested positive for herpes type 1 I‚Äôd understand, I went to summer camp, everyone shared water bottles etc. it‚Äôs more realistic! 

My boyfriend went to the clinic and the doctor refused to test him because visibly he was fine and unless there‚Äôs symptoms the doctor didn‚Äôt want to test him. The doctor explained how inaccurate the blood tests are in our country which is why he didn‚Äôt want to give the test, he said the emotional repercussions are far worse than the physical.

It‚Äôs been 4 years, I should‚Äôve felt something, anything, by now. My boyfriend should‚Äôve had something happen to him too, but there‚Äôs zero symptoms. 5 years together and nothing has ever came up. Where I live the Western Blot test is unavailable so I will never know 100% if I do have it or not. If things don‚Äôt work out with my current partner do I need to disclose that I might have herpes? Any advice what to do going forward?

2. I feel a general uncomfort on my groin area, along with some random prickly feeling that comes before sores (but no sores for the last month but the feeling wont go away). Also general pain that comes randomly in the shaft area (but no pain when i pee)

tiqnej,"Stuck in a herpes limbo‚Ä¶ Hi guys, looking for some advice, apologies for long post but it is quite a difficult circumstance to explain.

I first thought I was having a herpes outbreak a year ago. I had burning pain round anus (sorry for TMI), shooting pains down thighs,  buttocks  and testicles, no blisters but what looked like some small red spots round anus. Went to get a test but due to the shitty state of sexual health clinics during lockdown (all walk-ins cancelled) and how hard it is to get an appointment, did not get swabbed until after symptoms had started dying down. Dr said swab would be way less accurate because of this. This came back negative.

 Doctor said it was not a clear cut herpes case and if swab was negative to carry on with life as normal, which I did. Everything seemed fine until around 4 months later, I had a flare up of these symptoms again. Again, I went to clinic and went as soon as possible, again came back negative, but again accuracy of this was reduced due to the time it took to get swabbed ( think I had to wait around 6 days to get in to a clinic).

I stopped having sex with anyone and told myself I would wait till I know for sure my status before carrying on. I bought self test kit for if an outbreak ever came. Since then, I‚Äôve never felt like I have had an outbreak, but I have very regular nerve pain, down my anus, buttocks, thighs - It can be really painful! So strange, as this didn‚Äôt happen at all in the four months between suspected outbreak 1 and 2.

Fast forward to now, I‚Äôve recently used my swab kit once when I felt some pain down there and that also came back negative. I have accepted that I probably have it and can handle getting on meds and disclosing to partners etc, but can‚Äôt do this until I know for sure that I have it! I‚Äôm at the point where I would actually like an outbreak so I can get tested and know for sure - till then not really comfortable sleeping with anyone.

Has anyone ever had anything like this? Is there anything I can do?

I just can‚Äôt shake the feeling that she doesn‚Äôt deserve this. I haven‚Äôt spoken with her since the date I don‚Äôt know how to go about this I really don‚Äôt want to lose her but I‚Äôm well aware that saying nothing isn‚Äôt an option. Like is it for sure that she now has it? How do I go about this?
