twecrg,"Sti from oral sex? So I havent got a title, some guys say im gay, some think I'm straight I don't really care in all honesty what my title is as I'm sure everyone's situation is different but hey ho.
Long story short I live a straight life, wife, family, getaways etc but anytime I have free time to myself I might download grindr and see who wants to suck me off (That's all they do btw). I aint worried about who they are, what they look like just as long as they can accom, now I've been doing this for about 3 years, never worn a condom it's alot better than having a cheeky shuffle at home alone but after speaking to my doctor who said I shouldn't be on prep as my activities are ""no risk at all"" and not to have a HIV test as, again, if what I'm saying is true there is no point whatsoever.

Currently I think i need to take a HIV test as I'm coming up in boils all over my torso, neck and shoulders, my throat has been killing me for about 3/4days now and a gland in my neck thats never swollen before (normally it's just under my chin that swells when im ill but this is slightly lower)  I've been in bed 3 days in a row and I just woke up soaking wet from sweat.

tsujzf,"A month of medication .. I've posted previously about my recent positive result, and while it was a shock I guess things since then have been okay.

> You might remember me, I'm the guy that claims he didn't have unprotected sex, but has had a string of random short-term partners.  Unprotected oral, very definitely, very often, but I can't remember going without a condom, nor can I remember having one break.    Either I'm completely forgetful, because it's been a few years since my last STD test, or I'm grossly unlucky.  Further debate on that is pointless, but I guess the suspicion is that my memory is faulty - that actually I did have unprotected sex, sometime, and I was fucking unlucky enough to do that with an infected woman.

My initial viral load test showed a figure of 82,000.  After a month of medication my load is now down to  ""less than 20"", that's with me taking three pills a day:

* Darunavir (/ ""Prezista"")
* Ritonavir  (/ ""Norvir"")
* Biktarvy

So that's great news, I've was initially given a two-month supply of those three pills, but now I've been given just ""biktarvy"" to take going forward, once the other two bottles run out.

Next checkup in 6 months to see how things are.  But I guess I'm feeling _positive_.   No side-effects to speak of, and with such a low load I'm essentially untransmittable.

She bought two one for herself and the other one for me, we walked out of the store, I opened one tried and she wanted too, i hesitated but then gave it to her she hardly even put her lips to it, I knew that using I after her isn't a good idea but at that moment idk why I wiped the end of the vape with my fingers even tho it was clean like I mean no blood, saliva or sum like that it was dry and clean,and then I gave the vape that she used to her and took the other one for myself ( I repeat I didn't vape after she vaped )
Like I said the vape was clean and dry and my fingers don't have any scars or cuts on then.

tpt50j,"Unprotected anal as a top 4 days ago Linked up with a transwoman on Grindr. Went to her place, did the deed unprotected as we both said we were tested and clean. During pillow talk I brought up my results on my phone to show her to ""set her mind at ease"" and she said she didn't have a digital copy of her results. 

Turns out she'd been misleading about when her last test was, it wasn't a ""couple of months ago"" it was about a year ago. Kick in freak out mode. I requested she get tested for peace of mind and she said she'd ""get with her doctor"". She did not mention being on PrEP or any HIV treatment regimen. I am not on PrEP and, stupidly, did not rush off to a clinic to get on PEP. So I'm a slave to time now. 

A couple of messages back and forth since then, but noncommittal responses about when this doctor visit would happen. I flat out asked her to get a test and told her I'd pay for it, but no commitment to do that either. 

So I'm sitting here 4 days in and freaking the fuck out. 

I did all the numbers of course. 

* 1 in 909 if she is positive. Worst case. 

For unknown status, use community average. For a white transwoman, that's anywhere from 17 to 25 positive rate. That works out to 

* 1 in 5347 at 17%
* 1 in 3636 for 25%

I'm assuming worst case (1 in 909) since she wasn't truthful about her testing status. Pretty good odds, as long as you're one of the 908.

I can order HIV RNA from STDCheck and get blood drawn on Monday May 4th, 12 days after potential exposure. My research indicates this result will be from 90 - 95% accurate depending on the source. Some sources say this test can be effective as early as 7 days, but most say 9-11.

I can then get another HIV RNA test after 28 days, which should be 99%.

Not really looking for advice, typing it out helps relieve some of the pressure. 

Please be smart. I should have asked to SEE test results first instead of taking her word. I've never been dishonest about my results, and would never play if I knew I had something or my status was unknown. Huge mistake to assume other people are the same. Don't make it like I did.

**Edit 4/4/22**

Gave blood for the HIV RNA test today, 12 days after potential exposure. In all the (way too much reading) I've been doing over the last 12 days, I've got numbers saying it's anywhere from 90% to 99% valid at 12 days. If it's negative, that's a very good sign.

toknpb,"How to interpret my results?? Hey guys. I[24M],  received oral sex on 9th Feb this year. Developed STI symptoms(not all symptoms) of Chlamydia and Gonnorhea. Took the cetrafiaxone and doxy for 2 weeks. 

Initially I had little pain in testicles, erection only while waking up(morning wood), peeing often and chills.

The Testicles pain was due to simple epididymis cyst which I tested for later.
I also had buzz/vibrating feeling around my private parts though it reduced and now has stopped(atleast I do not feel it while I'm conscious).

I was paranoid as I had throat pain and itchy eyes(just allergy as I found out). Got video endoscopy and it was just normal congestion in my throat. I do have regular not so serious issues with my throat.

I took a urine culture test which was sterile(negative) on 20th March(sample collection day, 39th day after day of act(day excluded), result on 41st day).

I took Chlamydia and Gonnorhea real time PCR(PCR Qualitative) test which were negative on 20th March(sample collection day, 39th day after day of act(day excluded), result on 42nd day).

I took Urine R and M test which had all parameters negative(on 17th March same day result within almost 3 hours? IDK if it is possible) on 36th day.

I took STD Panel test which had all parameters negative(on 17th March same day result within almost 3 hours? IDK if it is possible) on 36th day.

around a week after the encounter i got a white tongue that i could scrub off with mouth wash and a toothbrush but 3 months its still been lingering; in a panic as anyone would at around a month i took an at home test and it was negative; then at around 55-60 days i took a blood draw test to run for other std’s, and luckily was negative, so i wanna know what conclusion i can take?

never had a fever, occasional cough and one of my tonsils seems to be a tad swollen its my left side, my tongue gets sore occasionally but alot of people are telling me anxiety; GIVEN i do tend to hyperfocus on little things and apply it to me being sick, i did test positive for EBV and my count was 600+ so ive been extremely fatigued and exhausted, i also have a UTI that was seen in my urine; i was prescribed doxy, fluconazole and cefpo to rule out other things; what would you take from this? are my results conclusive?

ive been losing sleep over this and just wish more than anything to be okay 🥺

So last year I had to switch and I went with Complera. I noticed almost immediately that my ejaculate changed. Now it is very white in color and is blobby. Meaning it is not as watery looking but instead looks thick and snotish.

tg1isb,"TO EVERYBODY WHO IS A HYPOCHONDRIAC Let me start by saying, I understand the anxiety of being diagnosed with a potential STD. It's fucking terrifying, it can alter your life. It can be a financial strain because of the cost of medications, and also it's extremely stigmatized, however here are some key facts. So people can stop fucking asking dumb questions.

How is HIV contracted? It's contracted through sex (vaginal or anal sex) you can't get HIV through giving a handjob, and you can't get it through someone giving you oral. It's not spread through saliva, so quit trolling and get over with your irrational fears. It is also spread through blood, unless someone stabs you with a needle that they filled with their blood or blood got into your eyes. mouth, or another mucus membrane. THEN YOU CAN'T CONTRACT IT. Also breast feeding, in case you're a 6 month old child browsing this subreddit. 

Second, let's talk about the window period of HIV tests. 

For starters, HIV can be detectable, thanks to the advancement of technology up to early as 3 weeks. Go get tested with a 4th generation Ag/Ab test, otherwise known as an Antigen/Antibody Test. These tests can detect both HIV-1 and HIV-2 (a rarer form of HIV found pre-dominantly in African countries). The window period for this test is usually around 45 days according to the CDC guidelines, this test has a high specificity and sensitivity meaning it is both good at ruling out and detecting infections. The reason this test has a shorter window period is because of it's ability to detect antigens which are present in the blood before the body begins to develop antibodies to HIV infection. If you get tested after 6 weeks, chances are very slim you are infected. However, to account for some people who have slower production of antibodies, because of antigen may not be detectable. It is recommended to re-test after 90 days or 3 months and then again at 6 months to account for VERY RARE cases, where people did not develop antibodies within a normal time frame.

I'll say it again. Test at 45 days or 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. If you get tested and these are negative, then YOU DON'T HAVE HIV. It does not matter, if you have ""oral thrush"", which BTW YOU NEED A DOCTOR to diagnose you, a lot of people have some white on their tongue, you morons. it does not matter, if you have muscle aches, or if you have loss of appetite, or canker sores. Those things can literally be caused by you guys being huge hypochondriacs. Now quit asking if your HIV TEST is conclusive. Grow a pair of balls and get tested, that's literally all you can do. Quit playing the WHAT IF  I HAVE IT GAME. 

It's annoying to see how irrational people are,.",53,14,2022-03-17 00:06:18-04:00,everybodi hypochondriac let start say understand anxieti diagnos potenti std fuck terrifi alter life financi strain cost medic also extrem stigmat howev key fact peopl stop fuck ask dumb question hiv contract contract sex vagin anal sex cant get hiv give handjob cant get someon give oral spread saliva quit troll get irrat fear also spread blood unless someon stab needl fill blood blood got eye mouth anoth mucu membran cant contract also breast feed case your month old child brows subreddit second let talk window period hiv test starter hiv detect thank advanc technolog earli week go get test th gener agab test otherwis known antigenantibodi test test detect hiv hiv rare form hiv found predominantli african countri window period test usual around day accord cdc guidelin test high specif sensit mean good rule detect infect reason test short window period abil detect antigen present blood bodi begin develop antibodi hiv infect get test week chanc slim infect howev account peopl slow product antibodi antigen may detect recommend retest day month month account rare case peopl develop antibodi within normal time frame ill say test day week month month get test neg dont hiv matter oral thrush btw need doctor diagnos lot peopl white tongu moron matter muscl ach loss appetit canker sore thing liter caus guy huge hypochondriac quit ask hiv test conclus grow pair ball get test that liter quit play game annoy see irrat peopl,"Sentiment(polarity=-0.07397727272727272, subjectivity=0.5194318181818183)",-0.07397727272727272,negative

te0us4,"PEP after one exposure PEP after one exposure

Hello, I (24M) went to a sauna two weeks ago for curiosity. I broke up with my girlfriend a few months ago and experimenting with a man was something I wanted to try. Yes, I was extremely irresponsible, but I hooked up with only one guy there, he didn’t look shady but I mean, a bathhouse isn’t the best place for an ideal sexual health; when I went to his cabin he told me to do it bb. I knew it was a BIG red flag but in that moment I was not worried (big mistake). I topped him, and I came outside of him. Of course after leaving, I started panicking of what I did (also because I realized it wasn’t something I enjoyed as I thought). Immediately I used a teledoctor and I started PEP 5 hours after exposure. 

It’s been 16 days and so far I only had some itchiness at the first week and a mild sore throat two days ago (I guess it was anxiety). But I’m really scared and I need to wait a few weeks more to ease my mind… 

I would like to find some real stories of people who were on PEP, and if my risk is really that low, based on what the internet says (CDC shows a really low risk chance but another websites show a higher risk for uncut insertive). 

Also, I would like to know if an p24 antigen test would be accurate enough to calm my nerves if I decide to take one this week? I will do my other tests on the 29 of March(33 days) and the 14 of April (47 days), will these two tests be conclusive? Does PEP delay seroconversion?

tcz0t2,"HIV scare | waiting for results  27, Hispanic, 287lbs, gay male.

Hi,  I had been completely abstinent for the past 2 years or so due to  COVID. I experienced about a 35lbs loss recently after buying a Peloton  and that coupled with decreasing cases in my county led me to go out and  try to be sexually active again. Given that I don't really have sex  often in general, I'm not on prep. I ask them to use condoms. I met with  a 21 year old male off of a hookup app, but he did not have his status  listed. For this reason, I asked him to use a condom. We tried for about  4 minutes and he kept losing his erection. He said the condom bothered  him. It was foolish of me, but I told him to try without the condom and  we tried again for about 3 to 4 minutes. I noticed a bit of blood, so I  asked him to stop. He did not come close to ejaculating, but the whole  no condom thing really bothered me. It's been a little over 2 weeks. I  went to the clinic for STD screening. Around this time, I was also  receiving treatment for my hypertension. I was prescribed a new pill  prinzide. After two days on it, I experienced some pretty bad diarrhea.  It lasted about 3 days. It was really bad on the second day. I must have  gone to the restroom 12 times in a single day and felt like I was  getting dehydrated, so I drank Powerade. The sexual encounter happened  on 2/22 and I started the new pill on 2/27. The diarrhea occurred from  2/28-3/2. I thought maybe it was the new medication, but my doctor said  it was rather unlikely that the pill could have caused it. I was  previously just on 5mg of lisinopril and the prinzide was 22.5 mg I  believe. I did seem to test positive for 2 STDs, so I'm wondering if  that may have caused the diarrhea. I can't really make sense of the  results, but it seemed like my WBC was higher than the normal range. I  was also tested twice for liver function and my numbers were about  triple what it previously was, but then it went down, so again, I'm not  sure if the STDs had anything to do with that. I'm still waiting for my  HIV test to come back, but I am very anxious about it. It's only been a  little over 2 weeks, so I don't know if I would have experienced  symptoms by now. The diarrhea was the only major thing that I noticed.  But anyway, here are some of my test results if they make more sense and  if they might hint at me having contracted HIV.

tasdbp,"Risk in oral with bleeding gums Hi there. I've read up a lot on this and I'm still a bit unclear about what my  risk is in this scenario, and it's had me in a very anxious state across the past few months. I had a blood panel with my holistic health provider today and now have confirmation that my immune system has been ""haywire"" due to a virus which to me basically says I'm extremely likely to be HIV positive given the circumstances

&#x200B;

Back towards the end of september, I had my first and only sexual experience to this day. I met with a stranger from grindr and sucked his dick for like 20 seconds. He didn't ejaculate  in my mouth, he ejaculated in his lap afterwards, but I'm sure there was pre-cum involved while I had his penis in my mouth. My gums don't actively bleed, but they bleed if I brush my teeth with a brand new toothbrush (hard bristles). Within a week I noticed an itchy neck rash (which in hindsight I think was an eruption of hives, that lasted on my neck for a solid few weeks) and about a week after (so approx two weeks post-encounter) I had a flat torso rash that lasted for a few weeks. I didn't notice any sort of flu or sickness during this time, but I did have paresthesia  (weird tingly feeling) and diarreah for like 1 day. I had a leg pimple pop up a few weeks later and a pubic pimple (infected follicle I think?) pop up as well. Since then, so approx 3-4 months post-contact I've had random chronic hives in single spots on my neck/chest, skin feeling warmer than usual sometimes (despite no real fever), i had itchy toes for a few nights. I suspected syphilis but the timing of the rash was too early, and covid wouldn't transmit through a blowjob. Meaning HIV is really the only real option here if I was infected with something viral  during this act. I just don't understand though, I've always read that the risk was always low and even if other things rose the risk (eg sores, cuts,) it was still relatively small when it came to oral. Given the exposure, precum coming into contact with healthy gums, is the virus really that easy to transmit?  I feel like the unluckiest person in the world now. If the person is recently infected and has an extremely high viral load, then just the type of contact just not matter, you get the infection anyways??? It was barely even a blowjob, it was contact for less than half a minute, yet everyone says the virus is hard to transmit. The blood panel also picked up some heart/circulatory issues and If im reading right, HIV can cause this too, but none of this makes sense. I thought it was a slow progressing illness, yet I potentially caught it less than 4 months ago and my immune system is already fucked?",3,1,2022-03-10 01:23:09-05:00,risk oral bleed gum hi ive read lot im still bit unclear risk scenario anxiou state across past month blood panel holist health provid today confirm immun system haywir due viru basic say im extrem like hiv posit given circumst xb back toward end septemb first sexual experi day met strange grindr suck dick like second didnt ejacul mouth ejacul lap afterward im sure precum involv peni mouth gum dont activ bleed bleed brush teeth brand new toothbrush hard bristl within week notic itchi neck rash hindsight think erupt hive last neck solid week week approx two week postencount flat torso rash last week didnt notic sort flu sick time paresthesia weird tingli feel diarreah like day leg pimpl pop week late pubic pimpl infect follicl think pop well sinc approx month postcontact ive random chronic hive singl spot neckchest skin feel warm usual sometim despit real fever itchi toe night suspect syphili time rash earli covid wouldnt transmit blowjob mean hiv realli real option infect someth viral act dont understand though ive alway read risk alway low even thing rose risk eg sore cut still rel small came oral given exposur precum come contact healthi gum viru realli easi transmit feel like unluckiest person world person recent infect extrem high viral load type contact matter get infect anyway bare even blowjob contact less half minut yet everyon say viru hard transmit blood panel also pick heartcirculatori issu im read right hiv caus none make sens thought slow progress ill yet potenti caught less month ago immun system alreadi fuck,"Sentiment(polarity=-0.054685292777398045, subjectivity=0.40321381104275833)",-0.054685292777398045,negative

t5cxi8,"HIV scare Hi, I'm 27yo gay male. I had been practicing abstinence for the last 2 years due to COVID. Recently, I decided to meet up with a guy. His status was not listed on the hookup app, so I asked him to use a condom. We had sex for about 8 minutes total. After the first 4, he took the condom off because he said he couldn't maintain an erection. He tried again for a few minutes (maybe like 3?) and I started to feel a slight burning sensation. I noticed a bit of blood, so we stopped completely. My guess is that I likely cut myself shaving (it's happened before) or I was just really unprepared/out of practice. I don't think the guy was into me at all, so he did not really maintain an erection. He did not even come close to ejaculating (he finished from oral sex shortly afterwards), but I am still concerned given that I didn't know his status. It's been about a week and I have an upcoming doctor's appointment for an unrelated matter, so I was going to ask if I can get tested. Is it too early to do so? I haven't had any kind of symptoms, but I am still quite worried about the 3 or so minutes he was inside without a condom and the fact that I started to bleed.

t54sn6,"Could the hospital have made a mistake?  I had unprotected vaginal sex with a prostitude in 9 September 2021. It was a big mistake and I didnt knew it back then. I panicked thinking she would get pregnant or I will get and STD, but my friends calmed me down and said everything is alright. I kinda forgot about it.

In February 2022 my doctor did my annual check-up everything came in normal but it reminded me to get tested for HIV. Even thought I never had any symptoms, I decided to get tested without my parents knowing. I went to the hospital and booked an appointment with an urologist on 10 February 2022. He told me to get tested and sent me to the hospitals lab. They took a blood sample and did a ""Anti-HIV / p24 Antigen"" test. I was so nervous that day. After 2 hours the results were sent to me. And they came in all negative. I hugged my cat and thanked god they came back negative. Next day I had the second appointment to review the results. The doctor said there is nothing to worry and I didnt have HIV or Syphilis and the test cant be false negative.He told me to be careful and use a condom next time.

But Im still worried because was the test conclusive after 5 months of potential exposure? Maybe they mislabeled the blood samples and they tested someone else by mistake? I did some online research and learned that the latest HIV test are %99 conclusive after 3 months. And they use barcode labeling on the tubes at the hospital I went which is a private hospital not a government one. (private hospitals are generally better in Turkey because they can provide a high quality and fast service). Although Im a very chill dude generally, Im so worried and feeling very nervous about this subject. My parents don't know about any of this and I cant tell because Im a highschool student.

After hours of research about AIDS and HIV whats eating me up is the possibility of my blood specimen have been mislabeled and the negative result is not mine. I was not alone when the blood being taken and there was another man who was giving a blood sample at the same time in the room but our nurses were completely separate and it was my nurse who sticked the barcode label to my blood tube. So she didn't mixed the labels, or did she?

Should I be this worried or am I just being paranoid at this point? I cannot talk to anybody about this whole thing and I feel depressed and anxious. It's always on my mind and its tiring.

t4m643,"HIV scare but not rlly. I have had sexual experiences with two people in my life. I’m a 22 year old gay male who was not out until recently (I am still not fully out—just to my parents and friends). The first time I had an experience was when I was 18. It was a sketchy experience—not that I think the man has HIV or that I contracted anything from him—but the experience in and of itself (feeling pressured by him and myself to do something) kind of haunts me to this day. During that experience I gave head. The guy didn’t come in my mouth, nor do I think he pre-came in my mouth. I don’t think that I had any cuts, scrapes, bumps, etc. in my mouth at the time. So from what I’ve read, I don’t think that there’s much of a possibility I would have contracted HIV in that moment. The only other experience I’ve had was with a man on PREP and we used protection. I recently have started dating someone and I think I’m just worried I may have gotten something in the past because I don’t want anything to come between my boyfriend and I. We haven’t had sex and he and are both getting tested to be sure. I think I mainly needed to vent/get my feelings of hysteria out in some way.

I am a Male 18 year old, Ive been experimenting but only been getting receptive oral aside from the last two times. Im pretty much at the point where I’m done with the experimenting. Not really into it, but the last two times have made me nervous.

First time was with a man on PreP, I was receptive bottom. He had no condom on, never ejaculated. It scared me, and he was rough. Not a great experience, I felt bad afterwards and got sick a week after with a cold and got freaked out. I started thinking I had HIV even after reaserching. As I type this out I realize that that encounter was probably nothing to worry about. I ended up reaching out again to confirm he was on PreP and negative.

This second time was similar except I was the top. Not forced but not what I wanted, I was in the guy for very little. I did not ejaculate to my knowledge.The guy said he was clean. I assume most people will say the truth… But again.

I am told this boost the immune system. Those with Amphetamine. Have no idea if it is a long term solution though. Perhaps it should only be used now and then.

Looks like it is the adrenaline and noradrenaline that have this boosting effect. Immune cells have receptors for these hormones.

Some studies etc:

st2v3k,"So I tested positive I've seen a lot of posts here where people say:

* ""I did risky thing .. am I safe?""  

So I thought I'd post my own little story, here from icy Finland.

I generally test myself for STDs once every few years.  I've never been terribly risky so I just did it for my own peace of mind.  Unprotected oral?  Yes, quite often.  Unprotected sex?  No.  Sex with hookres? no.  Sex with men?  No.

So it was quite a surprise when I got a phone call from the private-clinic I'd booked to say I was positive for HIV.  I'd gone in-person to give blood samples to be used for testing for various things.  So there was no talk about false-positives, or retesting.  (Maybe they retest the samples if they get a positive result?  Maybe the blood-tests are just ""good"").

Phone call was a bit brutal, as I was a little shocked.  But the results-guy told me ""Expect a letter from the local hospital soon - they'll want to see you in the next week or two"".

Sure enough I got an SMS a week later informing me of two appointments in the next week:

* One appointment to give (21!) blood samples.
  * Apparently being used to detect a) viral load, and b) to see what drugs I'll be using.
* Another appointment 10 days later to talk to a doctor, once the results were ready.

I went and got an EKG (not sure why), gave the blood samples, and gave a urine sample.  Everybody was very friendly ""You might find you live even longer with HIV!!!  We'll be seeing you every six months or so and can detect cancer as part of our testing!!""

Everybody also kept saying ""Normal Life"" too many times.  Doctor gave me magical pills, and we check back in a couple of months.  The assumption is that I'm ""good"" as my levels were low - that kinda implies I've had it for a while, rather than acquired it very very recently.

In the future?  I guess I'll switch to the ""once every two month"" injections, rather than having to take pills.

Questions welcome.  All the treatment was free, as you'd expect from the Finnish government.  All the providers were friendly and mellow.  I'm a bit disappointed in myself for getting it in the first place, but I guess the way I've been dealt with has been better than I'd have expected.",16,6,2022-02-15 08:23:47-05:00,test posit ive seen lot post peopl say riski thing safe thought id post littl stori ici finland gener test std everi year ive never terribl riski peac mind unprotect oral ye quit often unprotect sex sex hookr sex men quit surpris got phone call privateclin id book say posit hiv id gone inperson give blood sampl use test variou thing talk falseposit retest mayb retest sampl get posit result mayb bloodtest good phone call bit brutal littl shock resultsguy told expect letter local hospit soon theyll want see next week two sure enough got sm week late inform two appoint next week one appoint give blood sampl appar use detect viral load b see drug ill use anoth appoint day late talk doctor result readi went got ekg sure gave blood sampl gave urin sampl everybodi friendli might find live even long hiv well see everi six month detect cancer part test everybodi also kept say normal life mani time doctor gave magic pill check back coupl month assumpt im good level low kinda impli ive rather acquir recent futur guess ill switch everi two month inject rather take pill question welcom treatment free youd expect finnish govern provid friendli mellow im bit disappoint get first place guess way ive dealt good id expect,"Sentiment(polarity=0.10464015151515149, subjectivity=0.5421296296296297)",0.10464015151515149,positive

ssv3v8,help pretty sure I have HIV. I am a 37 year old female and I was having sex unprotected with a male that has HIV. He is on the medicine to keep him from being infected and from showing up positive. (I'm sorry I don't know how to explain). His is a alcoholic and forgets to take it a lot. I didn't know he had ever tested positive until it was too late. Anyways I have dentures and they sometimes cause these sores in my mouth. He was kissing he felt something. Turned the lights on and he had a horrible nose bleed. So that blood was all in my mouth with these sores. Fast forward I found out and went to the doctor and told her I had unprotected sex but was scared about the HIV part. I figured they would test for HIV as part of the workup. That was maybe 11 months ago. No HIV results on the results I got back. HPV and the STDs only. Which was all negative. Here we are 8 months later and I have been having SEVERE pains all over my body. So bad my hands and feet can't be moved because of severe pain. Doctor called me today and said she thought it was rhuematiod arthritis but it wasn't and every month for the past few my inflammation markers keep going up. She wants me to see a rhuematologist.

ssgwpo,How accurate is the oraquick test? Does anyone have experience? I had somewhat of an exposure scare six weeks ago. A few people on here told me not to worry the risk is low but I still want to get tested to be safe. I bought the Oura quick testing today and I just took it waiting on results. But the package says you shouldn’t take the test until after three months of possible exposure. It’s been 6 weeks for me.

ssez7u,"Need an advice Hello, I have no idea how reddit works but here I am, idk what to do, I'm lost.

So I'm 14, becoming 15 next month, and I've been living with my sister for the past year because my mom is an Alcoholic.

When I was little my dad was an alcoholic and my mom kicked him out, he wasn't really helping around the house, and wasn't really working either, and my mom had to work 3 jobs just to take care of me and my siblings ( my two sisters and one brother) which by the time I was born were 13, 14 and 16 or sum like that, and also my grandfather who had lost his leg and he wasn't able to walk so my mother needed to take care of him too.
My father was kind of pervert , once, when I was sleeping in the same bed as my parents he touched my private parts. Ew I don't even wanna get into that. 
My mom kicked him out when I was 5.
Then when I was 7 or sum she started this job as a social worker and she got this paralyzed client who's Alcoholic, she started to become good friends with him and all and then she started to drink with him, and then my grandfather died, and the drinking got worse, with time she would start to get abusive towards me, she would yell at me when shes drunk, hit me ( not always tho) and other things.
The abuse got worse  when I was 12 or 13 i think and that's when she started to physically abuse me, its hard to remember cuz it's all blurred but yeah. 

I was depressed really depressed, cuz of that whole situation and abuse thing.
My mom often would be at that man's house for weeks, drinking with him while I was alone at home, sometimes i was low on food, but the fridge was never completely empty.
But for some times she would be drinking at home and if she drank up to like a week she would get hallucinations and become crazy n shit cuz like all shes been having in her organism for a week is a fucking vodka so its obvious that her brain is gonna get fucked up, soo she would do crazy things like, almost peeing in a shoe, thinking that her paralyzed friend is at our house while theres no one there, and if I don't get him to her she would get angry
But don't think that I'm a saint, I talk back a lot, I used to disrespect her and call her names when shes sober, and I just can't stand her when shes drunk so sometimes I talked back and my talking back sometimes led the whole situation into a physical fight in which I wasn't fighting back of course.
Sometimes I would play friendly and just try to calm her down......
Shes really bipolar when shes drunk, one moment shes crying, the second shes laughing and third shes throwing things and yelling.
Shes really nice when shes sober tho,that makes me forgive her and I could never hate her.

Okay let's move on, yall know the backstory 

Sooooooooooooooo last February we thought her drinking problem was slowly going away so my brother decided to help her on one condition- that she'll stop drinking and stop inviting my father over( yeah she sometimes would do that, just so she has a company, somebody to drink with, he got diagnosed with aids 2 or 3 years ago and we were afraid that they were fuckin***) 

So my brother bought our house  a new door, gave me money to buy food, things for myself and also help my mom and buy her something when she needs and etc..
But then this one time she called my father over cuz something had happened and she needed somebody to help, ok he helped us, but after he helped us she didn't tell him to go, she told him to fucking stay and go to the store and buy something to drink......
And that's when I told my brother and he gave up on her ( maybe I shouldn't have done that)

But in the morning I packed a couple of my things and went to my sisters house, after a week of my mom trying to get me home, she finally did, I walked home I didn't even undress I just lied in my bed( that's when she asked if I'm okay) until it was time to go to sleep then I brushed my teeth and just went to sleep and in the morning I had online classes so I did them and by the time I finished my mom was drifting to sleep by a tv  in her room, I asked if I could go visit my other sister, she said yes, so when she fell asleep I packed my things and went to my sisters house, but my mom didn't know that i wont come back..
I still remember how peacefully she was sleeping, I still fucking wish I didn't go that day.

And then after like 1 month with living with my sister I got my mom to get tested for hiv, and I fucking promised her that I wont leave her even if she had it... 
she tested positive....
So my sister that I live with at the moment she told me that I shouldn't go back home  cuz of the hygiene and shit and that anything could happen and that I can get it too, etc.

Its been almost a year and I still wanna go home but my mom is still drinking and the surrounding at my house have gotten worse, my mom had homeless guys over her there, they slept in my bed etc., theres also been a rumour that she has bed bugs which probably arent true but anyways.
And due to all that my sister and her bf doesn't like me going over there so I basically am not allowed to visit her.
Only outdoors.
My sister also yells at me and emotionally abuses me, idkkk its just a lot
My mom would never treat me like my sister does when shes sober so idk what to do.....
Ofc a lot of details are missing and plus my English sucks here, cuz I'm stressed but anyways
I need some kind of advice....
PS.
My sister has two kids so I often have to watch them and If I sometimes say no she yells at me
For an example if I'm doing my homework, I have to drop it and watch her kids, if I don't she yells at me.
She sometimes wont allow me go out. She gets jealous when I go out with my other sister...
She calls me dumb, lazy, she always judges my  style ,my music, she says that I won't go far in life, and other mean things. Even if my mom is an Alcoholic she never said something like that to me... 
She also invaded my personal space my reading my journal where I often write how i feel and what's on my mind. She read the suicidal notes and then she called me crazy.... etc ..
Ofc she supports me too but like it's the mean things that get to my head..

Do yall think I should go home?

sq10a2,"NAT test accuracy after 31 days? Hello everyone, 
I’ve been on this page for a while and I have so much anxiety about my possible exposure. A month ago, I was at a nightclub and got way too intoxicated and blacked out. I woke up in my truck by a women knocking on my window. She was asking for some money and I said I would give her $20 for some head. Biggest mistake of my life, because she agreed and since I was still super drunk I didn’t think of the red flags. Just received oral , didn’t cum, and I didn’t have any other kind of sex, just oral. I woke up the next day with a rash that didn’t itch nor blisters appear. I went to get an viral culture/std test and blood draw 3 days after and the std test came back negative and the only thing found in my blood was hsv1 and the culture test found a bacterial infection, Entercoccus faelis. Two weeks after, I made another appointment with a health department and they did the same routine. Viral culture and blood draw from the vein. Everything came back normal and they didn’t find anything, not even hsv1. However, I’ve been having symptoms of HIV after the 2 weeks. I got knee pain, mild night sweats, sore throat, some pimples appeared on my back, some muscle aches, and my temp was at 99 but nothing higher, and my lymph node under my right ear is a bit swollen but that’s it. I went to the doctor on 2/11  and he told me that my acne and lymph node was related to my bacterial infection and he told me he seriously doubted I had HIV. I requested an RNA test and I’m waiting on the results, and the Docter was confident it was my anxiety that was causing the symptoms.

I had unprotected sex with a guy 3 weeks ago, and found out today that he gave me chlamydia.

I asked him but haven’t heard back, but he is a stranger to me and I have no clue if he could have it or not. hooking up with him was a huge drunken mistake that I can’t believe I made and now I’m so scared that the rest of my life will be affected by it.

So the thing is that I am worried I might have HIV, on may of 2021 I had unprotected sex with a guy and he gave me chlamydia and ureaplasma, didnt do any oral sex wit him, but I got those two stds treated and then in september I had unprotected oral sex with another man.

Then, the 2nd of january of this year I had oral sex with other dude and a week later I started having a sore throat again. I still have it today but sometimes it goes away and then it cames back. This time when I did the oral sex I actually had a little sore in my mouth but he didnt ejaculate in my mouth. What are the chances that I might have HIV from this encounters? I am going to get tested but my doctor told me to wait until march and I need to ease my mind until then.

Took it off, & tried but still couldn’t & As far as I’m concerned no penetration occurred at all but their was intense rubbing and grinding of each other genitals unprotected. especially when she got on top which I think that’s whats considered frotting. 3/4 days after that exposure I woke up with a slight throat ache, a lot of fatigue & felt like I was on the verge of getting a fever, after further inspection my left tonsil was covered in white spots. Looked up tonsillitis & the appearance was identical. Went to the clinic. They tested for covid/strep throat both negative. Took blood drawn from vein for hiv & syphillis did urine & oral swab sample for chlamydia & gono that were sent to a lab. Dr said most likely just a bacterial infection. Gave me antibiotics & that seemed to have helped clear up my tonsils rightaway. Yesterday got my results everything negative.

What do I do? My life is over if I get it I cannot literally go on...

I am not being dramatic I cannot do it.


Help please


Edit: please I am crying and really don't know what to do. I know I can't do anything until I get tested but what happens if I am positive. How do I go on? How do I tell people?


Update: going to a HIV clinic to talk about next steps. Monday is when I will have the results for an RNA.

How can I tell someone? I don't really have anyone to trust or close to me.

Update 2: Went to a HIV center and was tested (the test that you normally take at 4 weeks) this was negative of course.

I don't feel any more chills, nausea, etc however under my arm is hurting which doesn't help.

I know I can't do anything until Monday until I get the RNA test, but I just feel so lost that I am supposed to just wait until I hear about my status.




UPDATE 3: I took an HIV RNA Test today 1/31/2022 - It was negative - what does this mean can it be a false negative? The person said it was 96% accurate. What do I do now I am still very worried I have it...

My question is, If I was sick from an exposure would this test be able to pick it up? How sure should I be I do not want to get my hopes up....



UPDATE 4: I took a second HIV RNA test. It was not detected.

I understand I have to wait until week 6 but it is really difficult to wait that long. Not sure if I should take another RNA at 21 days?

sbbn0p,"Unsafe encounter | Waited 5 years to get tested | Ruined my life with the stress & scare of HIV | Lived 5 years thinking I'm Positive | Got a Negative Result but Crazy Joint Pain + Cracking whenever I move joints (would appreciate if anyone could help figure out what is it) Hi everyone! So I'm 26 today and when I was 21 (back in 2016) I had an unsafe sexual encounter with a massage therapist. It was also my first time and I was stupid who didnt realise you don't do it without protection (unfortunately, sex ed isn't really a thing in this part of the world) but after 15-20 seconds I realised this and asked her to stop. Went into crazy depression mode from right away and its the same till today. 

Had a 3 year long relationship, without even getting tested told my gf of what I did. It was guilt and fear that I couldn't stop myself, finall lost her after 1 year when she cheated on me and later married that guy. It was the most beautiful thing I had and lost it.

Changed my career paths. Became an entrepreneur. Did well but could never really act like a youngster as I was always scared I have HIV.

Gained almost 30-35 kg's in these 5 years. Didnt go to gym thinking I've HIV and I possibly don't have the strength.

I've basically ruined my life over this fear. No relationships. Not fully focussed on work. Bad health. Always depressed. Always angry. Being bad to family members. 

I recently got the courage to get tested and it all came negative. But I had another unsafe encounter on the night of 31st Jan 2021 so now waiting for the window period to get final tests done and I hope its a negative so I can move on with my life.

Now one major issue has been joint pain. My anxiety has been crazy. I dont think Ive slept peacefully in last 5 years, that should explain the situation. The moment I got a negative HIV result 10 days back, my pain in knees kinda disappeared but the girl I had an unsafe encounter with on 31st blocked me when I asked her to share her reports (I asked her to get tested and she said she did) so post that the pain came back again.

Now I'm 26. My weight is about 90 kgs and height is 165 cm. Obese. BMI 32 something. No pain before this HIV scare but it has been conistent since that first unsafe encounter.

I got xrays done 2 years back but when the doctors said it could be or is arthritis, I stopped visiting them because I thought they might ask me to get tested for HIV. I also feel that they read the xrays incorrectly.

Worry 1)There was a blowjob, she sucking me, I didn't ejaculate and she was only there for maybe a minute; no condom. Worry 2) We also kissed, my gums sometimes bleed when I brush, but not profusely and I don't have disastrously bad oral health. Worry 3) We rubbed the heads and shafts of our penises together, precum present there too, no condoms, worried about his precum in my urethra, etc. Worry 4) I finished her off with a handjob, understandably ending up with his semen on my hand, my hand had a scabbed-over cut.

s6i6xq,"Early HIV infection and loss of immunity HI all, 

I know that having an undetectable viral load is equal to no damage to our immune system . 

However , does our immune system get affected when we first get HIV and the viral load is too high ?
 
I feel that sometimes ,we , people with HIV are really pampered by the healthcare system  ( which I find great) but it also makes me wonder about the reason why we get all that extra care   when we have   undetectable viral loads and good CD4 (cancer check ups , etc) . Why do we have loads of comorbidities ? Is this only down to our medication or is it that our immune  system is not as good as it used to be before getting HIV ? Is there anything else that got affected when we got HIV and isn't recoverable in despite of our ARV therapy?

Also , I remember  having to get some boosters for hep b immunity  ( I don't know if the immunity  got lost due to the early hiv infection or it was just a normal thing that happens to everyone regardless of their status) 


Please bear in mind that some of this questions might sound so stupid and they might have  easy answers... but I'm sure that loads of people will have similar questions  to mine.

s3mvrp,"Had a Cut and 2 hours later I was with a Sl... Excuse my rhyme but I thought it might increase my chances of getting a reply from most people. 

So basically I was on Holiday, had a fall and bust my hand in few spots. I cleaned the wounds, sanitized them  and covered them with plasters. I left a date straight after that. Date went really well and fast track 2 hours later we were having sex. I kept on telling myself not to finger her with my wounded hand but that went out of the window and started fingering her with one finger before I came to my senses a few minutes later. After getting home I realized that there was a small wound on the finger that I used that I didn't pick up when I was patching up because it was so small. However there was a tiny spot of dried blood on the area which means it was an open wound and could be a source of Vaginally fuilds to enter my system. But it was dried so what is the risk?

It also doesn't help that I heard that the girl in question has been engaging in reckless sex and the last time she got tested was in 2019. She is hesitant to get test now and I can't exactly put a gun to her head. 

I spiral into a slow state on panic thinking the worst. Fastrack 28 hours later I was on PEP. But after reading the side effects on that huge paper, my refuge became a source of further worry. The two main things that are troubling me are the potential damage to kidneys and the reduction  of bone mass by 12 percent. The bone thing is scaring me to pieces because I already have very weak bones and I pick up injuries very easily but I haven't been diagnosed with anything.

s1sd8r,"HIV About 4 days ago, I went to my friend's house and we tried having sex (vaginal sex). We're both virgins and he had a condom on. The tip of his penis touched my entrance and my anus, but it didn't do all the way inside because it didn't fit. He didn't ejaculate and we also never had oral sex. The next day, we saw each other at work and everything was fine. I was feeling okay but the following day my mom started to feel sick. She took a test and it came out positive for covid. On that day, I also started to feel sick. It started off with a sore throat. I immidiately thought it was covid because my mom and I live together. I started to drink warm water and to take care of myself but the next morning I was even more sick. My throat was hurting, I had a headache, I had a fever and felt weak... etc. and that's when it hit me. HIV. I didn't freak out or anything because at the same time, I tought it was covid but the symptoms were so similar to HIV that I started to get scared. My mom was 100% sure it's covid so later that day, I took the test and it came out negetive. I was a little disappointed because if it was covid then I wouldn't need to worry about HIV but since it's not covid then what is it? My mom said it's just the flu (she doesn't know about me and my friend) but the HIV symptoms are exactly like the flu when you catch a cold. I tried my best to convince myself that it's flu season right now and it's probably just a cold but my symtoms are constantly reminding me of HIV. At the same time, it doesn't make any sense because we didn't even have sex and even if it did go inside, he had a condom on. Some people out there have sex almost everyday with different people, protected or not they're fine. This was my first time and we made sure he had a condom on before trying. It didn't even go inside and nothing went inside because he didn't ejaculate yet I feel like something's wrong. I don't have anyone to ask for help and I want to get tested but I have strict parents so I can't. My parents don't know about this.

s1e8xb,"Hiv risky exposure I m 54 year male living with my wife and kids in Dubai. On 23 November 2021 I had risky Exposure with indonesian girl for 2 to 3 min, where the Condom slip while she was on top. After I cum then I notice there is no condom.
No pep is allowed in uae for expats. No hiv test for expat as someone found positive will be deported immediately as every two years medical are done for resident expat for hiv. Exactly after 14 days of Exposure, I got weakness in legs and mild elevated fever at night with night sweats. Until now, the symptoms are still ongoing since 34 days. Fever was only for first night, but most of time i feel feverish in Air con, in normal weather i m ok. I always check my temperature it doesnt go more than 36.5. mostly my body temperature is low up to 35.5. Since 34 days on and off I feel flu type of symptoms with mild body pain. I didn’t got any rash, sore throat or swollen lymph nodes.  I cannot suddenly go to india to test for hiv , as if positive I have to leave my job, my car, bank loans, remove kids from the school and my wife has to resign from work, as they all are under my sponsorship.  I didn’t thought of the repercussion that time of doing sex with that lady. Now everything is haunting me. I will be jobless in my country. I don’t know how I will survive with my family. My questions are if any one one have idea : 
1.	Regarding symptoms, Still now more than 34 days I am getting daily chills/shiver in my legs and back of shoulder on and off for 30 min in day or night. My body and feets feel like inflammatory response for few hours, then subside for few hours and get normal.  One day I am perfect energetic and other day again feeling like minor flu type in body with malaise, but without fever. Some day I get night sweat and some day I m normal no night sweats, but no fever, but only feverish feel in 34 days, except the first day. Does ARs symptoms are continue or on and off. Why I get night sweats without fever. How long the ars fever last. Does the fever goes on and off. What is the reason of my chills daily on and off. What about body pain on and off. 
2.	I read many seroconversion stories mostly getting high fever, sore throat, rash, swollen lhymp nodes. Does the chills and mild flu type symptoms on and off can be ars or something else. What the severity of fever and duration. What about the malaise or body ache severity and duration. 
3.	Most of the time I am low temperature 36 only. The maximum temperature goes 36.4 only. Morning time mostly my temperature is low, below 35.9 Does hiv ars causes low temperature.
4.	I had read that,  if art treatment started during seroconversion is better as the virus doesn’t permanently damage the immune system. If anyone gets positive and start medicine after 5 or 6 months of infection, is it ok. Whats your opinion. 
5.	What about the seroconversion illness, mostly doctors saying ars symptoms last 1 to 2 weeks, but my minor flu like symptoms is going on and off since 34 days. How the patient are treated for the ars symptoms without art medicines.  Today I visited the GP, he did the cbc, urine, esr, crp blood sugar etc, nothing came. He just gave painkillers.
6.	Sometimes I have nerve vibration in the morning affecting all joint and head making me feel weak like fatigue, what is that. I have mitral valve prolapse before I use to get like that, but since I start taking my hypertension medicine it stopped.
7.	If anyone has kidney cyst stage 2, does hiv virus can make problem for the cyst if the treatment start in acute phase like 3 to 6 months. 
8.	How long anyone will get Aids from Hiv acute infection without treatment in general population above 50 years of age and co morbidity.",7,3,2022-01-11 09:33:00-05:00,hiv riski exposur year male live wife kid dubai novemb riski exposur indonesian girl min condom slip top cum notic condom pep allow uae expat hiv test expat someon found posit deport immedi everi two year medic done resid expat hiv exactli day exposur got weak leg mild elev fever night night sweat symptom still ongo sinc day fever first night time feel feverish air con normal weather ok alway check temperatur doesnt go mostli bodi temperatur low sinc day feel flu type symptom mild bodi pain didn’t got rash sore throat swollen lymph node cannot suddenli go india test hiv posit leav job car bank loan remov kid school wife resign work sponsorship didn’t thought repercuss time sex ladi everyth haunt jobless countri don’t know surviv famili question one one idea regard symptom still day get daili chillsshiv leg back shoulder min day night bodi feet feel like inflammatori respons hour subsid hour get normal one day perfect energet day feel like minor flu type bodi malais without fever day get night sweat day normal night sweat fever feverish feel day except first day ar symptom continu get night sweat without fever long ar fever last fever goe reason chill daili bodi pain read mani seroconvers stori mostli get high fever sore throat rash swollen lhymp node chill mild flu type symptom ar someth els sever fever durat malais bodi ach sever durat time low temperatur maximum temperatur goe morn time mostli temperatur low hiv ar caus low temperatur read art treatment start seroconvers good viru doesn’t perman damag immun system anyon get posit start medicin month infect ok what opinion seroconvers ill mostli doctor say ar symptom last week minor flu like symptom go sinc day patient treat ar symptom without art medicin today visit gp cbc urin esr crp blood sugar etc noth came gave painkil sometim nerv vibrat morn affect joint head make feel weak like fatigu mitral valv prolaps use get like sinc start take hypertens medicin stop anyon kidney cyst stage hiv viru make problem cyst treatment start acut phase like month long anyon get aid hiv acut infect without treatment gener popul year age co morbid,"Sentiment(polarity=0.11863636363636365, subjectivity=0.43562500000000004)",0.11863636363636365,positive

rvxjwc,"M[U18] So on November 1st, I had vaginal sex with a female (I don't know her status) and the condom broke, I noticed it when I finished, and cleaned it with water straight away, also it was my first time having sex.

I couldn't go to the Hospital because I'm not 18 yet and I couldn't tell it to my parents because I didn't have enough courage and didn't want to make them worry.

In less than a week after this happend I noticed some changes in my body, like pain while urinating, white tongue, swollen lymph nodes, little redness on the glans.

I ignored those symptoms, I thought they would go away on their own.

After 45 days (6 weeks) I had a mild fever  (98.6f or 37.0c to 99.32f or 37.4c) and sore throat, other symptoms remained..(fever lasted for 7-10 days)

Because of this I got really anxious and decided to tell my parents about it.

I went to the Hospital and got checked for HIV and syphilis after 52 days (7 weeks). They took blood from my vein.

And also got tested for other stds with swab after 53 days.

Every test answer came back as negative.

Doc told me that I only had some kind of Fungal infection (Candida maybe, idk exact name).

And now after 2 months I got fever, sore throat, pain while swallowing.

My questions are:
1) what kind of HIV tests are done with blood drawn from vein and are they correct after 7 weeks of possible exposure.

2) Is it possible for HIV to progress to AIDS after this short period of time? if a person has a weak immune system?

rtzsnm,"Could I have gotten HIV? Possibility of HIV

For about 2 weeks now, I’ve had constant nausea and stomach issues (which never had before). First thought it nausea only after eating, but realized it’s 24/7 starting the moment I wake up. Was starting to think it is a stomach bug or other problem, but less confident in that now.

Saw a doctor who did some basic blood test and stool samples, that all came back normal. I know those aren’t std/hiv tests. Would they provide a hint that something like std/hiv or something else on the body is wrong?

Anyhow, last time I had intercourse was about 5 weeks prior to having the constant nausea. Searching online (which I hate but do anyway) has nausea as an early HIV sign. Is it possible to have gotten std or hiv that is causing nausea? If this happened any other time besides close to having sex would even think of this.

rpjlna,"Well it happened, how where do I turn? I'm a male (27). Masc gay. 

It's official, I have been Diagnosed with HIV-1. 
On the 23rd of this month I was given the results over the phone.
I was standing in a shopping mall. 
Time stopped for a minute when it happened. 
I snapped back into my mind long enough to robotically drive home. I passed through my front door and instantly lost all control of my legs and fell flat. I cried incessantly. 

Now it's a few days later and nothing has changed. I still can't focus. I still have outbursts of crying, especially when I'm alone. I still feel numb. 

I was told I cannot get to a doctor till mid January. I feel overdramatic, but isn't this HIV, is it not taken seriously with priority number 1? I guess not. Holiday vacations are number one. It doesn't help with the stigma in my mind. 

Now I feel alone more than ever. I don't know where to turn to. The clinic I got this diagnosis from has been unprofessional and passé about my feelings and condition. 
I can't afford counseling.
My partner left me.
My family can't know.
A couple friends know, but have nothing meaningful to say. 
At the very minimum, I need a hug.

rnyndg,"Hi :) I might have HIV and idk what to think. The backstory: I had sex and the condom broke, but he hid it from me and didn’t tell me… I know this sounds stupid but I didn’t realize at the time. He also admitted later to being positive and not - I don’t know the exact term - treated in a way where he‘d test negative again. 

So, I’ve heard the risk of getting HIV via sex (in this case: female (me) and male (him), vaginal) isn’t all that big. But I’m getting tested anyway. Better safe than sorry, right? My immune system isn’t perfect though, so I’m worried that my risk is higher, I guess.  I also have anxiety, which makes me dread the results. 

I wonder if someone here may clear up a few questions. :) 

- I read online that if you quickly find out, therapy is usually working quite well and will ideally get me to a viral load where I don’t test positive anymore. Right? So would I be any more likely to get sick or develop diseases? I didn’t quite understand the information there 
- One thing I’m kinda worried about is judgement. Even if I was not able to transmit it, I should still tell my partner I have HIV right?  Have you guys encountered anything bad? I suppose you’ll get declined every now and then, but have you also had people telling anyone etc? While I’d love to break the stigma, I‘d rather do it at my own pace. 
- Now this one might be a bit weird but bare with me. To those ones of you who have herpes - have you gotten more frequent outbreaks?

Thanks to anyone who took the time answering this. I am kind of in a bad place rn because I had to get tested and take a pregnancy test because someone I trusted didn’t want to „put up with me being annoying“ after the condom broke. Ugh!

My problem is that I don’t know her health status and I was really scared that I might get HIV or any other std.

Results came all negative as I did for other stds too.
I just worry that maybe I did this test too soon to have accurate results.

In general I get easily stressed and have anxiety about things.
I don’t think that I had any major symptoms. 
I remember I had bad throat for 1 or 2 days but I think I got cold as it was bad weather. And today I have a mouth ulcer (I usually have these). I think I brushed my teeth with a toothpaste that contains SLS.
I have been acting weird around my girlfriend as I am afraid to kiss her to not transmit her HIV now that I have an ulcer.

Many Elisa tests were negative during these 8 months.Got EBV test and it came back as positive. My EBV VCA IGG was very high. 
•Can you get EBV from unprotected sex?
•Am i 100% safe from HIV 
•Can EBV cause rashes on penis, hands and feet?
•Is it possible that tests show true results until lymph nodes burst.
Can my viral load be naturally suppressd?
Also i tested for HERPES and SYPHILLIS both tests came back negative.
My doc said your HIV test is conclusive and you dont need any tests.

I apologize for the long post. I lost my virginity 3 months ago now. Vaginal sex was protected but I gave him oral and he came in my mouth without my knowledge and I accidentally swallowed it.

I then when to urgent care because the pain persisted and got tested again for everything including hiv through the 4th generation ab/ag test at 63 days which is roughly 9 weeks after possible exposure and the test was negative. I’ve been freaking out because I read online that persistent yeast infections is a symptom of hiv in women and my vagina is still in pain after 3 months. I’ve been prescribed pills and creams for my yeast infection but nothing seems to be working.

After we got back to the station, I restocked our bags, and then had to go to the bathroom ASAP. After going #2, I wiped but noticed my palm was red.

rbab0g,"My story with hiv anxiety 19M. Alright here’s my story with HIV anxiety. My hope is that someone out there who has rly bad health anxiety is reading this and hopefully it’ll help calm your nerves (even if it’s a little). 

So 5 weeks ago I had drunken unprotected receptive anal sex with a guy I met at a bar. He told me he had been tested for everything 3 months prior and that he was on prep (he even showed me the pills). I don’t know why but afterwards I was terrified I had HIV. Not even any other stds, just hiv. I’ve always had bad health anxiety but this was just on a whole new level. It fucked me up. Every day for 5 weeks I was just plagued with thoughts of having hiv. I honestly couldn’t function anymore. I stopped hanging out with friends and just spent a majority of my time in my room. I became depressed. Every time I hung out with friends/family I would tell myself that this is the last time I could do it normally until I get that positive test back. Every waking moment, I was just thinking about having hiv. No matter how much I told myself all the facts, the chances of getting hiv from a random partner are under 1% in my case (ignoring the fact he was on prep). I convinced myself I had all the symptoms for it too. I would check my lymph nodes at least 6 times a day every day. No wonder they felt swollen. I got a little cough too and figured, oh well it’s hiv. My joints would feel weird, not even hurt, and I thought it was hiv. Well I just got my neg test back at the 5 week mark (4th gen test). So I know I definitely don’t have it. 

Moral of the story: if you get bad health anxiety like I do, just try and remember that the odds are stacked against you for getting this disease. Only 4K males in my entire state of Texas get hiv every year. Compared to the millions who get tested. The chances of getting hiv from an anonymous partner through the most riskiest type of sex (unprotected receptive anal) is still under 1%. (It’s like 1.8% if the partner is confirmed to have hiv). This is not an excuse to have as much unprotected sex as you want. Hiv is still very high in gay men for a reason. No babies = more unprotected sex. Just play it safe, wear a condom, know your partner, and get tested. AND DONT LOOK UP SYMPTOMS. Literally acute hiv Is the most basic disease ever. None of its symptoms are unique in any way to the virus. Just play it safe and if you think you were exposed get on pep it reduces your chances of getting hiv by like 95% or something in the high 90s. Good luck.

qxzuny,"Precarious Situation and need advice Wanted to get this groups opinion since you all seem very insightful. Male, Hetero, 28. I had a relatively risky exposure in a foreign country. Unfortunately, due to being under the influence, I was not wearing protection for a less than 5 minute encounter. 

Fast forward to 16 days later I started to experience chills, redness, and folliculitis on my genitals (follicultis confirmed by Dermatologist). I stupidly took an Oraquick to test and it came up negative (what a waste of money on my part). 

On day 22, I took a full std panel that included a 4th generation blood test. While waiting for my results, on day 24, I got a fever, stomach pain, and loss of appetite which lasted 24 hours. I assumed the test would then be positive, but on day 25 I found out my entire std panel was negative. 

Since then (now week 6), I’ve had a very mild soar throat and I’ve also been diagnosed with Seborrheic dermatitis (by dermatologist), and follicultis on my butt (by dermatologist). The Seborrheic dermatitis is primarily on the scalp (medium discomfort) and chest (mild). I got  Seborrheic dermatitis on week 4.5. I plan on getting retested this week. 

For what it’s worth I also had a completely normal CBC this week (5.5-6 ish) with my lymphocytes smack dab in the middle of the range and a in range WBC. 

My questions are:
1. Does my test at day 22 hold any water?
2. Is Seborrheic dermatitis extremely alarming? I don’t know much about it?
3. What do you think my chances are of a positive diagnosis?


Obviously I’m filled with anxiety , but will answer any questions you have logically.

qxm7s0,"M28, potentially high risk. Hey guys! I just want to post these here, since I'm having extreme anxiety over this. Had an exposure, vaginal and oral. Vaginal mostly in condom, when I was without condom, I quickly realized(2-3 mins) what I was doing pulled out and just walked away. when I got home I inspected closely, noticed a small cut on my foreskin, most likely from the condom. 

I was calm for a few days, but I noticed slight tingling in my penis on day 3. Went and got checked, no gonorrhea or UTIs, but the doc said they found some fungus in my swab test, (potentially yeast?). Gave me a fluconazole 150 mg course for 7 days. After a visit, I had a funny feeling in my bladder and prostate for like 2 days. No discharge, no itching, no swelling, no white patches or anything really, no pain during urination, no raised temperature. It is weird, can yeast cause such symptoms in such a short timeframe? 2 weeks on and I feel like normal, except for a slight discomfort in my lower back, which can be ultimately caused by anxiety and worry.  

Has anyone had something similar? Should I go for additional chek-ups? What are the chances of contracting HIV in my case? Honestly, it is all I think about for the past few weeks...

qusrxc,"Need to calm myself I'm a 22 gay guy and I was actively engaged in some unprotected sex with multiple different partners from hookup apps until about a year ago but I also got tested for HIV at my local clinic every 3-6 months depending on how active I was sexually. My last negative test was in December of 2020.

It had been almost a year since my last test and I had stopped hooking up with such random people. The only encounters I have had in 2021 was with a handful of men (5 or 6) and the only sex we had was oral with me being the giving party.

Now I went to get tested last week as I was running errands and thought why not and the test came back positive for antibodies but not antigens, we went through all the motions of getting me started on medicine and setting an appointment with the clinics doctor and all that good stuff so I've been on Biktarvy for almost a week now. The clinic workers mentioned that this test is considered a preliminary test as it could be a false positive (although they said false positives are rare) and they sent me to get more blood drawn and sent away for more in depth lab work which I went and did same day. 

I've known about HIV since I was a teen and have been even more active in my own education surrounding it for a while so I know it's not a death sentence and it's possible to live a normal life with proper treatment and care given. 

In the end my question is really just how concerned should I be for my results?

qtfe30,"Health care provider that recently came in contact with blood and accidental needle stick. Hello forgive me but I’ve been recently freaking myself out over these exposures. 

I’m a early 20s male with only one sexual partner for the last 4 years.

Exactly 16 days ago I was starting an IV in a patient and when I went to occlude the vein and place the saline lock her blood squirted and ran down my arm into my glove. It was a decent amount of blood as she had very high blood pressure. I instantly wiped my hand with an alcohol based disinfecting wipe. She stated that she did not have anything but the next day noticed I had some small scabs on hand so I’ve been very stressed about it. 

Two days ago I had a diabetic patient who just got out of prison after 13 years. When I went to pick up his blood glucose machine I got a small prick from one of his needles he uses to test himself. No blood was drawn from my hand and he also denied having anything and denied being sexually active in prison. 

Since last night I’ve been very warm and sweating from my palms and soles of my feet. I just noticed that I’ve had a a very mild headache for the last few days and have not been able to eat more then a few bites a day. Ive been researching the early signs of the disease ever since and it has caused a serious amount of stress for me. 

I’m sorry for posting here but I’m currently part time and am not covered by insurance. I’m struggling hard financially and when looking into places to get tested for hiv and hepatitis they want me to at least bring in 50 dollars which is going to put me at risk of not paying rent this month. Since my current employer is privatized I’m worried if I go to them they will blame me for not using proper practices which my put me farther into my financial situation. 

More about myself I drink at least 6 days a week at anywhere from 3-8 drinks a day. Smoke marijuana multiple times a day (over the last few days I have not smoked at all due to anxiety.) And am fairly healthy otherwise.

qs17uh,"Hi So in the last six months i’ve been seeing this girl who i met on Bumble. We would have safe sex and sometimes unprotected sex. But recently around August, she had a strange incident where she got blacked out at a party and someone took advantage of her. But she didn’t know this because she was blacked out of course. probably a week and half after this incident we met up and had unprotected sex. We don’t talk for about 3 weeks. she calls me out of the blue and tells me she pregnant and we’re both freaking the hell out becuz we are not dating and do not want children. So a couple days later she has me drive her to PlannedParenthood where they told her she was almost 6 weeks due. Me being stressed the fuck out, didn’t even line the dates up correctly from the last time we’ve hooked up. Weeks go by and she gets an abortion (pill). maybe a few days after she called me in confusion told me how odd it was that the dates don’t match up with when we last hooked up to how far along she was when we first went to PP. She pretty much connected the dots and told me the dates line up exactly to when she got blacked out at her friends house. i can’t tell you how bewildered we both were and the expression in her voice nearly had me tearing up. she said she was most likely r****. we both aren’t talking much now but i try to check in on her and listen to whatever is going thru her mind. she’s severely depressed and is not ready to go get tested for std’s. But my anxiety is so bad and all i can think about is the possibility that i contracted HIV and the thought of telling my strict christian parents that i’ve been seeing a girl and got an STD. i have no symptoms of HIV but i know that doesn’t necessarily rule it out. i just have the worst anxiety ever and feel so alone. where should i get tested? and what are some things i should be asking when i see a MD? sorry for the long winded post, i have very few people i talk to and none of them know about my situation.

One of them was based in another city in my state (same city that the health department’s zip was from) so I’m thinking it was him, but very easily it could not be. If it is him, he didn’t cum inside me. In the end it doesn’t matter, I don’t blame whoever gave it to me and I don’t resent them. I made the decision to not use condoms just as much as they. Also it could be a partner from any time of my life, doesn’t have to be a recent partner. But 2 years ago I moved states and the health department called from my current state which makes me think it’s more recent, which is relieving. I called my primary care doctor and told them of the exposure, rapid test and how I’m waiting on the blood work. I asked if I should take any medication currently even tho I could’ve been exposed a long time ago. Waiting for a call back. 



If I’m being honest, I am REALLY freaking out. I keep imagining how this will impact my future relationships and life and expenses. I’m trying to accept that this might just be my life so that I’m more prepared for the positive, but I’m so afraid. I’m scared I’ll never find a relationship. I’m scared doctors will treat me different. Im scared of the financial impact. I’m scared to disclose to close people in my life. I have paper thin skin and bleed easily and I’m scared for the people around me. 

I know I don’t know the results yet, I don’t feel comfortable telling anyone else in my life yet, and I just needed to let it out in a safe place. I hope I have not offended anyone, I know this is manageable. I just need a safe place to share my fears and feelings.",8,1,2021-11-05 14:15:01-04:00,anonym call say f expos got call last night health depart say anonym partner put sexual partner someon expos hiv use teach sex ed know hiv isn’t death sentenc know it’ complet manag know undetect untransmit social stigma terrifi thought would impact life scari immedi call friend support found rapid home test kit took result said neg morn went blood taken bc know rapid test can’t accur it’ friday it’ll mid next week get result i’v two sexual partner year unfortun didn’t wear condom either one base anoth citi state citi health department’ zip i’m think easili could didn’t cum insid end doesn’t matter don’t blame whoever gave don’t resent made decis use condom much also could partner time life doesn’t recent partner year ago move state health depart call current state make think it’ recent reliev call primari care doctor told exposur rapid test i’m wait blood work ask take medic current even tho could’v expos long time ago wait call back i’m honest realli freak keep imagin impact futur relationship life expens i’m tri accept might life i’m prepar posit i’m afraid i’m scare i’ll never find relationship i’m scare doctor treat differ im scare financi impact i’m scare disclos close peopl life paper thin skin bleed easili i’m scare peopl around know don’t know result yet don’t feel comfort tell anyon els life yet need let safe place hope offend anyon know manag need safe place share fear feel,"Sentiment(polarity=0.051754385964912275, subjectivity=0.4394736842105264)",0.051754385964912275,positive

First of all, i want to implie that this post is not intended to offend anyone, just telling my story of anxiety. I was all ready been told that my risk for hiv is really low. I’m fully aware my symptoms most probably are not hiv, but anyway, i will test tomorrow, as the 90th day mark will reach, in order to clear my mind from uncertainty.

My situation is i had vaginal and oral sex (receptive oral) with a girl who i fear has HIV, i have my reasons for my fear, it’s not worth retelling. I used a condom for vaginal, but i didn’t used the condom 100% correctly. 

26 days (3.5 weeks) after the sex i took an only antibody blood from a vein 3rd generation test at a lab. It was negative.

12 weeks after this sex, i had a fever, headache, night sweats, that lasted for 24 hours. Went away after taking analgesics. Common sense told me that it might be another thing, i know that’s the most likely thing. But i just want to test at day 90 to clear my mind and chill after this stress.

I'm a male aged 21 

I had unprotected sex with a man and a woman at the beginning of September( first week). I did not engage in any anal sex but oral and vaginal sex did happen, I gave oral to both the man and the woman and I did have a sore in my mouth. Fast forward to the end of November. I started having pain on my urethra and I checked with a doctor. My blood test and urine tests were conducted and nothing came in it but I was diagnosed with non-gonococcal Urethritis. I have noticed white tounge way before my urethritis started. And now I have lymph node swollen on my left neck just down my ear lobes. I know it was a dumb thing to do and I was pretty drunk then. I'm just losing my mind, so I would want to know if I should test now for hiv and would it show any result if I do it now. Or if I should wait. Also I get fatigued pretty easily. Even if I walk a little bit on a steep slope.

Also since I'm really uneducated about this, I would like to know if I'm at a high risk to get something like HIV.

I’ve had pretty much all acute HIV Symptoms still testing negative after exposure.

I had insertive anal sex where condom may have broke with a trans lady.

I have tested at 4 weeks, 7 weeks and 10 weeks all negative and with home sampling. Which I believe would be 3rd gen using a finger prick. And then another at 80 days 3rd gen which was blood drawn from vein.

I have even had an antigen and antibody test at 65 days also negative.


I have had a fever for 2 months, I had very painful neck lymph nodes. Have a burning sensation in forearms. I have persistent diarrhea and oral thrush. Tinnitus. bruising easily and way more. Fatigue. Muscle Aches. Just general discomfort and feeling of burning on my arms. Droopy eyes. Headaches

90 days on I am still feeling extremely unwell. Nothing psychosomatic. Whole body has felt like it’s burning.

I’ve never physically felt like this before and I know the odds are low given the tests I’ve done but it seems highly unlikely I pick up a rare condition off the back of my exposure that mirrors HIV for the first time.

I have now went to my GP which I was avoiding as I can be diagnosed without him. This is the worst setting that I could find out personally and he drew lots of blood for different tests. He seemed fairly concerned with my symptoms.

I have read so many accounts where people have said they feel symptoms and never test positive but I will find out this week.

qeqvo1,"Did a home STD test, got a call from the clinic saying the flags for HIV & Hep B are higher than the cut off - HIV is ""Low reactive"" Just over 4 weeks ago I let another guy give me a hand job, but as he did it he licked his thumb and rubbed some of his saliva onto my penis head to lube it before I could stop him (I'm paranoid about catching an STD, wont even allow oral) We also snogged for a bit.

So as per the title, I got a home test kit from [sh.co.uk](https://sh.co.uk/) and sent it back Monday. I got a call today from a nurse saying my urine/anal/mouth samples came back ok, but that with my blood sample ""the flags for HIV and Hep B are slightly higher than the cut off"" and when logging into my account my HIV test shows as ""Low reactive""

I'm absolutely petrified.

She says its quite normal, and that 99% of the time after a retest its all clear and that i'm the 6th person she had called that morning to say the same thing too. I have to go into a clinic tomorrow for a proper blood sample.

After some googling, my understanding of a ""low reactive"" result is that I've basically tested positive for HIV, but that they want another sample to confirm before they tell me :-(

I feel like my world is crashing down around me and Im shaking just trying to type this.

I keep telling my self how I would have got HIV??

I had another experience a week or so prior to that which was just a normal handjob.

I did have anal in June. I wore a condom, and there was 0 touching before hand, I inserted myself into the other guy and was in there for maybe a minute before stopping. The condom did not break, and I took it off without letting it touch me before washing my hands and then my penis. The guy also said he only does things with condoms, and he had a large supply so believe him.

But I got a test just over 4 weeks after that which was all negative.

Just on here to see if anyones been through anything similar or can reassure me?

Thank you :-(

qc0uas,"Does this sound like HIV?  

Already waiting results on a test but I’ve been an anxious mess for a few days now. To the point where I’m thinking every little thing that could be associated with the anxiety I’m thinking is associated with HIV...which is making everything worse...

32/m - This past weekend I randomly saw a small amount of discharge down there. Now this was weird because I haven’t been sexually active in months (last time was the first week of September). And all of my partners have been known HIV negative for years (people I very much trust and have known for years, not just randoms). I did an oraquick test but it was a defective test. Since I needed to be seen for the discharge anyways, I figured I’d just get a work up done while I was there.

Combine this with the fact that I just got over a bout of potential COVID in August, followed by an a cold the past week/week and a half, and now I’m freaking out thinking I’ve had this for years and never known. And I mean YEARS. Potentially up to 6+ years.

I never got tested because I rarely put myself in “risky” situations. I’m not saying I was perfect, and I know I SHOULD have been tested much sooner, but I’ve only engaged in sex with another male twice, both times fully protected, and every other time has been with a female, mostly women I knew were not HIV-positive

I did engage in unprotected sex with random females during my college years, but they assured me they were STD free, and it wasn’t often (I can only think of maybe 4 encounters total?). Statistically speaking, I realize it would have been very, very difficult to even encounter a woman with HIV to begin with, much less contract it from her.

I did have some kind of NGU back then as well, which was treated by antibiotics and cleared within a couple days. The doc I saw back then wasn’t super concerned about many STD’s given the information I gave, but obviously gave me some information on gon and chlamydia, did a culture that turned up positive for an infection, gave me some antibiotics and sent me on my way. 

However, I’m not seeing much progress this time around from the antibiotics I was given. It’s only been a couple days, and I see that it could sometimes take up to a week or more, but it’s still unsettling to me. 

None of the trusted partners I had in the past 6+ years have contacted me about contracting any STD at all, much less HIV, so I believe that also might be a point in my favor but, also, just never know.

The clinic I went to this time recommended a full std work up, which from what he told and I understand is common practice, he did a physical examination of my hands and feet, no abnormalities, once again gave me antibiotics, and then sent me on my way. Said they’d call me within 4-6 days with results.

Since my last sexual encounter, I’ve had covid and a cold, both of which have subsided. Some other symptoms I’m experiencing now:

\-loose stools (could be from anxiety)

\-dry cough/coughing up phlegm (also just getting over a cold, also I have allergies)

\-occasional shortness of breath (also probably from anxiety)

\-“rash” on my face (I have dry skin on/around my nose, have had it for years, and I didn’t keep up with lotion/washing my face over the weekend so it’s noticeable at the moment)

\-loss of appetite, but I’m still eating normal proportions (also could be anxiety related, and because I’m still eating without the appetitie, could be contributing to loose stools)

I have not been feverish, have not had much fatigue (other than maybe from lack of sleep with all this keeping me awake), no swollen nodes, not losing weight, no random sores, just in general not “sick” at the moment from what I can tell.

The only other cause for the discharge I can think of is I happen to have a resistant strain of an NGU bacteria like MG, and so it just now decided to present itself over the weekend. Would also explain the lack of progress on treatment.

I’m also thinking that if this was some kind of late stage HIV, that I wouldn’t be getting over two completely separate sicknesses in relatively normal timeframes.

I guess another question I have (if you’ve made it this far lol) is if anyone has had experience with recurring NGU, and what that experience was like.

If you made it down here to the end, thank you.

q601li,"Possible exposure to HIV? So I did bad things this weekend.

I was totally drunk when I got a hooker (in germany, not a street hooker tho) and had sex with her. The bad thing is, I noticed that she wouldnt show me her vagina (she layed on her side), so I assume I might had anal sex with her. Now I think she might have been a transgender woman and I just didnt notice because I was so drunk. After like 15 to 20 minutes I stopped and didnt cum, because I thought she was hiding something. I don't really know if we used a condom tho, we probably did, dont know for sure! 

After that she asked if i'd like to have a line of  cocaine  and I said yes. sniffed the line right after she did, with the same Euro note. After that I wen't home and slept all day.

Now my mind drives me crazy and I was hoping someone could cheer me up. 

I learned about PEP just today, so its too late to go to the doctor.

Got a HIV PCR test at 15 weeks but still negative(my underarms were very swollen at that time) Did HIV Elisa at 6months still negative. Still have rashes on my penis and some spots on hand and feet which comes and go. Tried every antibiotic and OTC meds but nothing worked. Also have swollen lymph nodes, fatigue. Its been more than 6 month now nothing is showing up in tests.
Is it possible that tests show true results until lymph nodes burst.
Can my viral load be naturally suppressd?
Also i tested for herpes and syphillis both tests came back negative.
My doc said your HIV test is conclusive and you dont need any tests.

q26pla,Parents asking too many questions So my bf is HIV positive and he is undetectable. We have been together for 4yrs. My parents moved in with me in January and since then my bf has been worried because he gets his medication shipped to the house and he doesn’t want my parents finding out he has HIV because he feels like my parents will judge him. Knowing my parents they most definitely will because my mom made a comment about how if he has anything I better not stay with him. Then a couple of months ago my dad got licensed to sign people up for life insurance and wanted my bf to be his first customer and my bf agreed. A guy called my bf telling him he got denied because of his hiv which he understood. Then today my mom asked me what medical condition does he have that got him denied because she knew for awhile and didn’t know how to ask. Like that is just so rude to me to ask that because it’s none of her business. I just told her I have no idea (because it’s not my place to put my bf business out there).

pnt83q,"Question to other Pos peeps. Okay so I tend to have a policy where I'm pretty open to talking about my status especially with sexual partners. But I've been told that since I'm undetectable, it isn't something I NEED to tell every sexual partner. I've been with my partner for two years, he's HIV neg, and I'm HIV pos & Undetectable. He's the one assuring this to me.

Which tbh I understand because it can definitely cause anxiety in both me and the other person, even though scientifically we know it cannot be transmitted. It's just something that is already being controlled the best it can be. But I also feel it does need to be disclosed at some point if I want to continue having relations with someone. At the end of the day it doesn't affect the other partner.

Anyway the main point of this post is to ask y'all who are HIV pos, where you stand on this? As well as those who are HIV neg, what your input is?

pdfz65,"Cum on hands with tiny cuts, mutual masturbation with HIV+ person. Risk of contamination? Hello everyone,

A partner unfortunately came out as positive on their latest test, a few days after we had a few sessions of unprotected foreplay/sex. The only acts involved were mutual masturbation, facesitting (no oral contact) and there was no penetration whatsoever.

&#x200B;

However, it should be noted that:

&#x200B;

1. He came on my hand on a few occasions, and this worries me as I have a few small cuts on my fingers (I tend to bite them). None of these openings were bleeding during the act, that said.
2. I remember masturbating soon after he came on my hands, a few times.
3. We kissed a few times, but no saliva contact or transfer was involved.
4. A friend gave protected anal sex and unprotected oral to that person, and swallowed his cum. He does not appear to have any cuts or irritated areas inside his mouth, or on his gum.

&#x200B;

My question is, given what we've done, is the HIV+ risk real, or minimal? That friend and I will get tested in a few weeks from now, either way. Just looking for some more opinions... I've asked a few friends and a medical worker (not doctor), they all think we should be alright, but I'm still worried.

I confronted him on why he gave me a used one. My dumbass believed him and just proceeded with it. This happened Friday around 10am and because of the weekend I wasn't able to visit the clinic and get on PeP therapy until Monday at 5pm. Studies show its only effective when taken within 72hrs but I am on the 79hr mark. I feel a little comfortable but I'm so mad at myself for doing this. I graduate in 2 months in the medical field and I've been clean for so long with no intentions to go back until this past incident I got weak. Not only that but freaking used his syringe. Any advice?

p9w3vj,"I’m so scared It’s now been 12 days since possible exposure and the anxiety has been non stop constant crying and I can’t eat or sleep. I met this guy on a dating app and I thought he cared about me and I trusted him, after talking on and off for a few months I went to his house for sex. I asked multiple times if he has any std or hiv and he said no. I even inspected his dick and mouth before I touched him. He did have some small bumps around the under part of his dick head but it didn’t look gross or anything, it looked kind of normal like something I’ve seen before. I googled it and it came up as something called Pearly Penile Papules, god I hope that’s what it was. He also had a white tongue, and he had a rash on his neck that he kept trying to hide. Starting the first day afterwards I’ve felt tingling/ burning in my vagina where he rubbed his dick head on my hole, like right above my urethra and below my clit. After he rubbed it on me he said “now you have what I have”. I thought he was joking and told him to put a condom on. After he was done fucking me he said “Jokes on you I took the condom off halfway through” again, I thought it was a joke. It was dark in the room but I looked and I think I seen the condom still on when he pulled out. Oh and the next morning he texted me to say he felt no connection with me and he wished we just stayed friends and I haven’t spoken to him since. I’m so fucking scared that he knew he had something and gave it to me on purpose. I got tested on day 6 for all stds and everything came back negative. I’ve been swabbed for herpes and it came back negative and I have no bumps. The doctor gave me antivirals while I was there just in case but it’s been 6 days now and I feel like my symptoms have gotten worse. The inside of my vagina burns and it looks irritated and a little swollen at the opening. I’m going today to get a blood test. Starting on the second or third day I started getting a burning/ tingling/ numbness in my feet and hands. Mostly in the bridge of my feet, heels and toes but also in my hands and wrists. I know it’s a weird symptom but I googled it and it said it might be a symptom of a viral infection. I hope he didn’t infect me with hiv or something else. I have no flu symptoms, just the weird burning in feet and pain in my vagina where he touched me. Maybe some tingling on my lip where he kissed me but that comes and goes. Everyday all day I look at my vagina checking it for new bumps or any changes, it’s all I think about, I can’t imagine having to live with this anxiety everyday for three months so I can get tested again. I feel like my world is falling apart. I don’t usually use Reddit but I’ve been reading this thread everyday for a few days and it’s been helping with the emotional support knowing there’s other people going through the same thing. Sometimes I just feel so alone. And I feel ashamed and embarrassed my face turns red just thinking about it, I’m really convinced he infected me with something but I guess I won’t know for sure until I’m tested again. The uncertainty and what he said to me is what bothers me the most.. I keep replaying this night over in my memory, and I can’t get those words he said to me out of my head. I talked to my therapist a couple days ago and that did help ease the anxiety for a little bit but it always comes right back. I guess I didn’t realize just how fucked up this situation was until I started taking to people about it. I just keep thinking about it all day everyday. And if he did purposefully infect me I know I’m going to have a hard time proving it, I get tested regularly and always came back negative, I never even had an std before, but I don’t think he’s been tested.

p999t2,"Anxiety about HIV- One-night stand help Hi

I'm from India and I recently had a sexual encounter with a sex worker (girl). 

We'd multiple sex acts during that night: 3 vaginal intercourse and 1 oral sex(receiver).

First two intercourse happened during the night, and I was completely drunk so during the second time I didn't had ejaculation. She loosened the condom a bit to reduce the friction (what is the possible exposure?) . We left as it is and went to sleep. 

PS: All the vaginal intercourse were protected expect that intentional condom loose and the oral sex was unprotected. 

I got worried and visited a sexologist. He recommended taking PEP. I started PEP on the third day (50th hour).

Since the encounter I'm experiencing some DISCOMFORT/SORE (not visible) IN MY PENIS and TESTICLES continuing throughout the day.

p2bbmy,"Freaking out about hiv, actually unable to hold my nerves together. I'm genuinely scared. So I had sex with someone in a bout of depression after repeated mental pressure put onto me by my family. I got threatened with getting killed by my father at least 4 times and he almost did it and I ended up pretty much with a ptsd. I thought I was losing my mind, had bouts of depersonalization and derealization.

After a month of dealing with these issues I was with a friend and we had sex with a third person (he suggested we do it so I can have 'fun' and forget about my issues, haven't really had sex for a long time). I wore a condom the entire time, except took it off briefly after the first oral (before any penetration) and stupidly used the same condom again after. As far is I could see the condom did not burst and my cum was still in it after I removed it after sex. It all feels like a blurry dream since I was in such a bad mental state.

I got freaked out because we met the third person for the first time, so I did not know their background. When I asked if they had HIV through messages later they said no, but I also know they have a lot of unprotected sex.

I was put on pep a day later, but after 3 days when I went to the HIV centrum they told me the risk was so low that I should stop taking pep. About 5 days later I developed a rash on my inner thighs which looked like infected hair follicles. I was given an ointment by the doctor which helped it go away for the most part. I was also feeling itchiness all over my body which went away after 2 more days.

About 7 days later I started getting a small sore in my mouth that healed after 3 days followed by another sore. I also developed diarrhea. At the same time I also started noticing small rashes here and there that come and go within like 30 minutes up to 2 hours. They are very mild and disappear after a little while. I also experienced burning on my chest at night and acid reflux.

I've not had a fever or swollen lymph nodes, no tonsilitis, a little weakness but I had it prior to this as well (chronic).

I'm really not in a good state of mind. It doesn't help my mother noticed I've been going to the doctor more often and to hurt me she said ""I hope you come down with an illness so bad that all you can do is be fully dependant on me like a dog and you cry about it until you die"".

I had a test the first day after sex and I was HIV negative, I'm waiting for the 6 week mark. I went to 2 different doctors who didn't think much of the rashes and both said if it was serious it would be body wide and not go away so fast. As for the diarrhea they think it is something else causing it. I told them I was scared of HIV but they said my symptoms were unusual and they didn't really suspect that. I am awaiting a stool and urine sample result right now and waiting about 3 more weeks so I can get tested for HIV again.

The reason I'm typing all this is to see if anybody knows what might be going on and if maybe my suspicion of HIV is correct after all.

p0yfwg,"Am I at risk? Hello everyone, I hope you are well 
I'll tell you my story to put it in context (I'm 21M). Three weeks ago I stayed to see a friend (19F) with whom I had a relationship a few years ago and we ended up as good friends (We were both virgins) and after that she was with some people in another relationship and all that. We met at my house and I had my first time. The problem came because I had a hard time keeping an erection, by this time I had already touched her clit a little with my fingertips for less than 2 minutes (no penetration). We started and lacked a lot of lubrication, moments later I lost my erection again and I took off the condom and then I touched my penis to stimulate myself without having washed my hands before, I put on another condom and we continued for a few minutes (maybe seconds). We decided not to continue and she was going to help me finish with her hand, but it hurt a little and I thought I was missing lub, so I touched the outside of the condom again, I removed it a little to see if there was lub and touched my glans with my finger to check if there was enough, everything was fine so I put it back on but it did not continue. Two days later I started with symptoms of a cystitis and after a self examination I found three small ulcers in a vertical row on the shaft but these are almost not visible because they are not deep, it looks like it was from friction as it looks (yes, I still have it) as if a layer of skin has been lifted, I went to the doctor and he did not tell me anything bad about the ulcers and gave me medication but the cystitis did not go away, the following week I went again and now it was injections, everything was fine for a few days, I felt perfect but from Wednesday to today I have had intermittent fever, I feel very tired and weak (I have not been able to sleep very well) a little runny nose but without being congested, pain behind the eyes, poop a little watery but not runny, my arm bones ache and it hurts a little to move them, chills, scabs inside my nose, red rash around my nose but it goes away a little with normal cream, a lot of sweating in the mustache area, a little blister on the tip of my nose, chills, no desire to eat (maybe because of being stressed thinking about the possible disease), general malaise, swollen groin glands, a little sore throat and all the symptoms of cystitis or urethritis (burning during urination, a little clear discharge, testicular pain, lower back pain. Do you think the symptoms could be from the urinary tract infection or is it a probable case of HIV? I have been very stressed these days, my anxiety is at 1000% and my head is a mess with all the possible diseases. I hope you can support me. Thank you very much!

Note: I forgot to say that this woman has not presented any symptoms.

Last Friday I got a blowjob from a street hooker (a cheap one, she offered, I said sure why not). She seemed nice enough, we got chatting and she mentioned she was addicted to heroin and had started using needles in the past 6 months but her friend did it for her since she couldn't hit the vein. I have no idea whether she is HIV or not.

It didn't click with me until the next night, and I've been totally freaking out since.
I came in her mouth, she spat it out quickly.
I know the chances are miniscule, she would have to be hiv+ and have sores in her mouth or something and the virus would have to travel from the sores, through the cum and up my urethra for me to get a chance of being infected, but none the less I am freaking out bigtime.

I feel totally fine, but every little pimple on my arm I'm considering it could be a rash, my dick has been getting little tingles like I need a piss or have just cum but fuck knows, that isn't a symptom, it could just be placebo for all I know.

I noticed this evening there is a tiny tiny tiny red dot (not even a bump) on my dick that wasn't there before, but that could be any std I suppose. As long as it isn't HIV+ or AIDS I don't care what it is, as long as it's curable.

1psjc8,"I know this question is so damn stupid - but is it safe to get tested? Had sex with my girlfriend who had an ex with multiple partners, she have never tested for HIV and had unprotected sex for only once with her ex (vaginal, no ejaculation). 

I fully understand that considering what I've had with her (protected vaginal, unprotected insertive oral) even if she had been positive my chance of getting HIV would still have been next to nil, but I nevertheless want to get tested mainly due to the totally unwarranted fear that I might have been infected before and could have hurt her - nevermind my only remotely possible exposure to HIV other than having sex with her was a dental filling at an private clinic with substandard decontamination standards, and test results from a blood donation one year later reported negative (I assume so, as they didn't contact me later for anything).

So after some googling for test centers close to me and (yes I know I'm fucking retarded doing this but I just can't stop) possibility of infections in blood sample collection I'm now scared of actually getting HIV during testing. I'm planning to go to the local CDC for testing but since it's a lab exclusively for HIV/STD testing I fear that those who go there would have a higher-than-average chance of having these. I went through some forum threads and all of them have nothing but reassurances - equipments are strictly single use only, staff are highly trained, HIV is suspectible to pretty much everything and can't survive long out of body - but I'm still scared. The testing requires getting skin punctured and I fear there could be spillages on surfaces around me that still have active viruses in them.

I have to mention that I'm doing this in China (I'm native Chinese) and while I feel mostly confident of the professionalism of the medical staff, all these things that have happened over there weren't very inspiring. So from a purely theoretical standpoint, is there risk in getting tested? The medical equipments used are certainly sterile and safe, but I'm worried about blood spillages in the surroundings and in air.

I had a slightly risky encounter 7 years ago with an HIV-positive male and I had been avoiding testing for years out of fear of facing the reality that I had HIV. Depression, hypochondria and mental issues have arisen in those years and it got so bad that I finally had a whole blood HIV-1 rapid test done this summer, which came back negative. I was still feeling off (swollen lymph nodes all over for months, white tongue, fatigue, visual disturbances) so I went to a different clinic and got another 4th generation test for HIV-1 Ab/Ag which came back negative again. my symptoms are still strong though and I'm worried.

My question is should I get another type of test done? The ID doctor said HIV-2 testing was unnecessary and that ELISA/WB/PCR testing would have the same results as the rapids if I were testing after 7 years. But I can't help shake the feeling that I need a different test. I just wonder if I've seroreverted, or somehow contracted a rare strain or HIV-2.

1op96e,"World Aids Day (looking for feedback) The LGBT club at my school has proposed an interesting idea and would like to know what some other people think of it. Mostly if it's horribly inappropriate and offensive or if you think it's a good idea.

.

We were thinking of placing a table in a highly trafficked area of our campus and have 2-3 people at the table. One of whom is HIV+ (We already have a person who is comfortable doing this, me.) A sign on the table would read something like End the stigma, hiv+ people are just the same as you and I, or something to that effect.

.

The idea is that people could come up and talk to the people at the table, and wouldn't know the difference between the hiv+ person and the other people there. We would collectively educate people about hiv stigma, what it means to be undetectable and on treatment (with regard to transmissibility), and generally promoting safe practices and informed decision making to help reduce the stigma.

.

Both before and after we are done talking to the people, we would ask them which person they think is HIV+ (the idea being that they won't know because there's nothing different about that person). Just to show them that there really is no difference, and to not discredit someone just because of it.

We got a hotel and pretty pissed and I bottomed (which is a first) he pulled out and came on my chest, it was then I noticed he didn't use a condom, but he said that ""bfs don't use condoms because we're failthful"" So I just went to sleep. Anyway next day we started fooling around again and things got really hot. Before I knew it we was fucking again and because he never used a condom the night before, I didn't think about it the morning after, again he came on my chest (I know, username relevant)

He's had unprotected sex with 2 other ex bfs, he's never been tested.

Question is: Chances through bareback? If I get tested now, will it be pointless because I should get tested 3 months later? Anyone from the Uk now a confidential way of getting tested?

I have already beaten myself up about it, I know I'm stupid. Only looking for advice now thanks.

It doesn't really bother me but I don't usually get sore throat. Few people around me do have the common cold, maybe its that? Another thing maybe it's related, I had a small ulcer few days ago but it seems to have disappeared (also I did use difflam throat/mouth wash couple times this week). I'm hoping its a common cold but other than sore throat i feel perfectly fine.. so getting just a sore throat of the blue isn't a good sign right?

I know most symptoms start normally after two weeks but is it possible to get a sore throat in less than a week after exposure?

I will be on the look out for other symptoms next 2-4 weeks.

I guess there isn't any point of doing a hiv test right now too right?

I will be getting tested of other sti's asap.

I opted for adult massage and handjob. She used baby oil and gave me a quick had job, and then second time, she brought a latex glove and penetrated my anus by an inch or so while she was giving me hand job.
There was no french kiss, not even a covered blow job. Just a naked hand job and anus fingering with glove.
What I don't know is that whether she has any open cuts or lesions on hands.
What are the chances here to contract HIV.

1mt9ip,"Thought I had HIV and also infected my wife. I just wanted to share my story. I'm 30 years old, straight and recently got married in June 2013. 

2 weeks before I had my wedding I wanted to cross off a fantasy I had for years. I met with a bi sexual married escort couple that provided 3some services to bi and straight guys. They even provided bareback (unprotected) service. I decided to do this high and drunk and made a stupid decision and agreed to have an unprotected straight 3some with them. We engaged in all sorts of penetration and oral acts you can think of: DP, DVP, anal sex, giving/receiving oral. At some point during our session the guy even asked if I wanted to do DAP (double anal penetration). I nicely decline because I knew there was a high risk of exchanging blood with that act. After it was over, I honestly have to say it was the most erotic thing I have ever done.

Fast forward to 1 week after my wedding, I found sores or pimple like symptoms growing on my tonsils. I freaked out and went to the doctor. The doctor diagnosed me with strep throat and prescribed me some antibiotics. The strep went away and came back after a week, I went back to my doctor and he prescribed me with some stronger antibiotics. The strep throat went away and I never felt anything weird or suspected of being infected with anything.

Fast forward again to today 9-20-13. My wife calls me and said she had to leave work due to a really bad fever, body aches, headaches.. etc. She went to the doctor and the doctor said she had a 101 degree fever and has some sort of infection because the back of her throat was bright red. The doctor gave her antibiotics and sent her home. I then started to think.. maybe I got infected with HIV from that escort couple and gave it to my wife??!!. I started to freak the F out at work because about 5 days ago my wife and I had sex while she was on her period, I thought maybe I passed something through her blood. So I decided to pick up the OraQuick HIV test, locked myself in my office and took the test. I waited for the longest 20mins of my life. When I check the test results, it came out negative. I have never been so relieved in my life.

I just wanted to share my story with y'all here because this is something I can't tell anyone I personally know and I just really need to let it out. Its my dark secret and I am planning to take it to the grave with me. 

If you have any doubts about your HIV status please pick up the OraQuick HIV test kit from a CVS or Walgreens. It only takes 20 mins to find out. Better to know then to not know.

I feel like I should treat him the same as I would anybody with a chronic condition that is being managed with medication. And that means treating him the same as I do everyone else in the world. It's like he acts as though HIV is who he is. Not a virus that he has, that is actually being treated very well with his medication.

1i8g9x,"Hiv+ ? Don't go to Canada. Check it out. Let me start by saying i am a 50 year hold hiv+ gay male. I recently tried to go to Toronto to meet another hiv+ gay male in the hopes of starting a relationship. We had chatted on-line and seemed to hit it off.
Upon arriving at Pierson, I was questioned by Customs at the airport. I told them I was here on vacation and where my hotel reservation was. They asked who I knew in Toronto and I said, "" No one"" which I thought was the best answer because I didn't think my on-line buddy qualified as a friend yet.
I was directed to go to a secondary inspection station. I noticed that many men traveling alone were also being interrogated.
This cunt of a Sarah Palin look-alike went through my bags, asked for passwords to my phone and lap-top, social security number and continued to question me about my criminal background.
I did not mention an arrest 14 YEARS AGO, of which the charges were dismissed for lack of evidence. She accused me of lying and said that she could send me back to the states for either my lying or the underlying criminality- in other words, there was no right answer. They kept me seated in Customs for 2 hours while they stared at my laptop. When the other travelers were all gone and they brought out evidence bags, I knew I was going to be arrested.
They cuffed me and said that I was being arrested for smuggling material ""Offensive to the Crown"" and took me to a cell where I was strip searched.
I asked for a lawyer. When the agent began speaking to the lawyer, he said I was being arrested for ""Attempting to smuggle child Porn""!
Now let me explain- there were some salty pictures on that computer. I don't remember what they were, because I have had a new computer for a couple years, but there was nothing of people that could be considered under age. Hell!, I don't even like to be around children!
So I spoke to the lawyer on the phone and she gave me the standard advice, but I could sense the loathing in her voice.
Next part is surreal. I had been in custody for hours. It was time to take my HIV pill. The Customs agent said he couldn't let me just take a pill. He called for a Paramedic. The Paramedic arrived and said that he couldn't give me the pill either. I was transported in an ambulance to a nearby hospital! While on the gurney, a dead body was pushed by next to me. Children with broken bones were screaming everywhere. Citizens fed up with the shitty Canadian health care system were screaming at the staff. I sat and contemplated my future. Charged with trying to smuggle child port was the final insult to my dignity. First I became an older gay man, which is devastating in itself. Second, I acquired HIV in my 50th year, which was also devastating, causing my two close sexual companions, who I had known for almost a decade, to abandon me. The HIV drug was also making my life miserable with the side effects. So being charged with this awful crime was all that I could bear. I decided then and there that I was going to make bail, go to my hotel and jump from the balcony. I took comfort in this thought, given my current circumstances.
I waited in a small room surrounded by pandemonium and two oafish Customs agents for two hours before a nurse (my hero) came in and said the following, ""So he has to take his meds and instead of handing him the pill, you admitted him to the hospital? Are you kidding me?!!! She then left because only a doctor could give me the pill and discharge me. The doctor came in and asked what I was being arrested for. I said, ""I have no idea. I am a businessman from California on vacation and the next thing I know I am being arrested for smuggling something they think is offensive"". ( Why was this question appropriate for a doctor to ask? Did this have something to do with my health?) The doctor gave me my pill and back to the airport we went. Oh, by the way, I had to pay $700 for the ambulance and the ""Treatment""
I asked the agent if the bail system on Canada was similar to the states. He said at that point, "" I don't think it will come to that, they will probably send you home"".
Well thanks for telling me that 6 hours into this ordeal! Fucking asshole! I had just decided to end my life! He then added, "" There were definitely pictures of underage males engaged in sex acts on my computer. I explained I have no interest in that. He said, "" Well that's good to hear"". (Keep in mind, they did not show me their ""evidence"" so I have no idea what the pictures were. And how did they know the subjects in the pics were not of age? I like Asian guys, and they look boyish into their 30's!)
Back at the airport I went from Customs to Immigration. The Immigration agent summarized my situation. I was not getting into Canada. My passport had been flagged and I could pretty much expect the same treatment should I try to enter Canada again. Then she said the strangest thing of all. She said that when I told the first customs agent that I was traveling on vacation and that I didn't have names and addresses of friends in Toronto, my fate was sealed. She said that I couldn't just come to Toronto to ""hang out"" in the village. I said, "" Yes I can"" I have done it before, and I often go to cities just to hang out. She countered: ""No you can't"". I was blown away.
I was asked to sign a voluntary exit statement. I had reservations. Isn't this what third world dictatorships do? Isn't this like signing a guilty plea under duress? I was told that I be on the first flight out in the morning, due to my desire to involve the US consulate in my detainment (good advice for any traveler). I think this may have helped in the long run. Next I was told that I would be held in a detainment center till the morning. I was cuffed and perp walked out of the airport.
The detainment center was basically a jail. The guards and drivers were civilians. This was a corporate jail. The employees of the detention center were very civil and polite. They treated me well and I will always be thankful for that. The facility, however, was a converted motel and the beds were scary. I thought I would get lice by laying on it. I lay there in the dark for 3 hours without catching a wink of sleep. My bunk mates were Sikh Muslims that were obviously having their own problems with the authorities. One was crying in his sleep. I was able to observe the detainment center employees while I was waiting for the ride back to the airport. They were all either Black, Middle eastern or Hispanic. Their main chore in their jobs was keeping from falling asleep. This was all they talked about. One employee said he wanted to paint eyeballs on his eyelids so the looked awake at all times! When they dropped me off at the airport, I thanked them for their kindness and told them that I was not guilty of what I was being accused of. They said that did not matter to them. I explained I had some dirty pictures on my laptop, that was my crime. They then smiled and said, "" Oh my God! They do that to travelers all the time!""
An extremely cute Immigration agent told me that he would try to get me on the 8:20 flight back the US. I waited then he told me that flight was full and I would have to wait for the 11:30 flight. So I sat for hours. They then perp walked me to the ticket counter, through security and to the gate. They even walked me on to the plane. Dignity is non-existent at this point. The final insult is that the plane sat on the ground for an hour due to mechanical problems.
So now I am back home. I have a record of a hideous arrest on my record. If it could happen to me, it could happen to anyone.
Here is the takeaway: Since 9-11, we have over-funded all these agencies that have to justify their existence. Most of the facilities that I saw were largely empty and over-staffed. If they don't produce arrests, how can they say they are relevant and deserve funding? I can only imagine what my arrest cost Canada in the way of labor hours. And for what?

1hp0mt,"I'm the neg partner in a serodiscordant relationship and my SO seems to be slowly dying Hi. I'm fucking scared.

My SO[36M] learned he had HIV while with me. He doesn't know how long he's had it or how he got it - I have my own suspicions, but overall, that doesn't concern me. 

He got on medication in October of last year. He's about 90% with his meds, missing about a day a month, I think. 

He also works as a teacher, easily hitting over 60 hours a week. His job is stressful because the people he works for are not very organized for running a school. 

It is these two things that have had me growing increasingly concerned, and lately, terrified for his health. When we first met/got together, he was just kind of old - joint aches were his main issue, and it wasn't so bad. But after almost a year on the medication, he's become much worse - generally, there is a lot more blood exiting from his body than before (from vomiting and sinuses), he says he is developing ulcers, and he is extremely tired all the time. He rarely sees a day off to rest from his ridiculous hours. And, to be honest, he doesn't really take all that great care of himself either - he regularly smokes and drinks, though he drinks significantly less than he used to.

I'm coming here because I'm scared he's dying - he seems to be getting worse every day that I see him. He's proud - so he tries to hide what it is that he's going to, and I still have trouble helping him bear that burden. So I can't directly help him...I also don't really have anyone to talk to - I don't want to go around telling people, ""Hey, my SO is HIV positive!"", because for the most part, they also know him.

And...we don't really have the money to go to a doctor. -I- have health insurance, but it doesn't extend to him...

If any of you have seen your partner go from strong to weak while on HIV meds, how did you handle it? What did you do? I'm scared I'm going to lose him.

tl;dr: My SO is old, overstressed, and on HIV meds. His condition has gone from okay to bad in the past year. I'm scared that he's dying and I don't know what to do.

Well I say sex, it was just oral both ways, but I did let her cum in my mouth and I swallowed some of it, there wasn't a huge amount.

I've been looking up statistics for the HIV risk with oral. Obviously I have no idea if she was clean or not (I know I know, bareback oral was stupid), but I can't get any clarity on the risks. Some sites seem to think there is potentially no risk of HIV from oral, or maybe some small risk.

For example, the CDC site [CDC](http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/law/transmission.htm) lists various estimates if risks but I don't quite follow what they are saying.

For example, they say receptive anal intercourse is a risk of 50 out of 10,000 exposures. So, do they mean all exposures are unprotected with a HIV+ person, so if you do that 10000 times you expect to catch the infection 50. Or is it out of 10000 times using protection. Or is it just out of 10000 whether the partner is + or -, out of 10000 you'd expect to catch it 50 times statistically? It doesn't really mention if its with protection or not.

LIke I said, it was oral only, and after 3 months I'll pop along to a GUM clinic here (UK sexual health clinics) as I assume thats how long I have to wait.

18ywmb,"Are you posting here because you think you may have contracted HIV? A large majority of the questions on this subreddit are people wanting to know if they could have contracted HIV in an extremely low-risk sexual encounter.  Let me be clear:  HIV is not easy to catch.  Very rarely does someone contract HIV from one sexual encounter with an HIV positive person (although it can happen).  Bottoming for condom-less anal sex where someone cums in your ass would be a fairly risky sexual act.  Bottoming for condom-less vaginal sex where someone cums in your vagina can also be fairly risky.  Men are much less likely to contract HIV from a woman.  Oral sex is considered low risk.  Any kind of sex with a condom is considered low risk.  Decreasing your exposure to semen or vaginal secretions decreases your risk of contracting HIV.  If you one time performed oral sex on a woman and you think you contracted HIV because you may have had a small canker sore in your mouth, or you topped someone with a condom and later heard he might have HIV, or you gave someone a  blow job and they didn't cum in your mouth, but WHAT IF!!??!!??, then you probably need to do two things more than you need an HIV test: 1) Stop putting yourself in any kind of ""what if"" situation and always use condoms and lube during all sexual encounters; and 2) **Go to a counselor and get treatment for your anxiety.** 

Your anxiety is presenting itself in the package of HIV, but you are probably anxious about a lot of things.  You probably worry about things all the time.  You probably need to get some counseling or start medication to treat your anxiety.  These things can help you deal with your anxiety so you're not constantly worried.

18xcvr,"I'm scared... Hello people.

I have something I worry about quite dearly. 3 years ago I had sex with a prostitute(I was young and foolish)in a sex club where I know they get regularly tested for STD's. Anyway, during the act the condom broke and we pretty much noticed it right away, I was exposed for maybe 10 seconds.

Few days after that I coincidentally got a sore throat for a day or two and since then I haven't gotten any other symptoms beside feeling tired once in a while. So I wen't for a blood test to the doctor to find out what could be causing this tiredness and it turned out it's vitamin deficiency. Now I'm not sure if he also tested me on STD's or if the possibility of me being HIV positive would've been obvious from a blood test regardless of the lab workers looking for it directly.

I never even thought of the possibility that I could be hiv positive until my long term gf suddenly has migraines (we've been sleeping together without protection for at least one and a half years.) and when googling what could be causing those migraines HIV came up and so I wen't on to read about the other symptoms of HIV and found out that the sore throat is one of them and as a result now I'm terrified.

I have not shown any symptoms until this week when I noticed a patch of red skin on my forehead and its been there for a week.

I read online these types of patches of redness can indicate a weakened immune system.  Thoughts?

18klkm,"Needing support  Hey guys,
 
HIV/AIDS was not even on my radar until the past couple of months when my friend kept stressing for me to get tested. As a 20 year-old gay male, the thought of HIV settled in my head and has caused nothing but stress and anxiety since. I have had unprotected sex with two men the past year, both who have claimed to be HIV negative; however, with my boyfriend of 5 months who was a virgin before we met, I can no longer carry the burden of possibly endangering his life. Especially as us both being in the closet in regards to family life.
 
The past year I have been healthy with no ARS symptoms whatsoever. There have been a couple strange things though.
 
Dry, patchy, itchy skin along my neck and face. These patches came and went for a period of 3 or so months. They only existed when I was at school and would disappear after only a couple days of being at home with my family. I concluded that it was perhaps something to do with the water or another allergen within my apartment. My skin is perfectly normal now.
Tonsil stones. Disgusting little things. I recently started having at least one a day or more for a while now... Throat feels fine and looks okay. I had tonsillitis in the last year and went to the doctor to get diagnosed. Everything was in order and the doctor had no other suspicions. Tonsil stones are still a disgusting part of my everyday life even today.
Ear infection. Never had one until last year. Came and went in a week or so. No other symptoms besides feeling deaf in one ear, haha.
 
I have already discussed the matter with my boyfriend. He comforted me saying that there have been poz/neg couples and it can work and that how if he was also positive, it didn't even matter then. He promised he'd love me either way and that he could not be angry at me. I just hope that if I am positive, this be the case.
 
I went to get tested a few days ago through my school's free testing program. Guess how long I have to wait for results? 2-3 weeks. 2-3 weeks of agony and worrying. What a broken system this is. Anywho, I decided to bite the bullet and get tested because it is the responsible thing to do.
 
Another person who I had unprotected sex with (I both topped and bottomed) a handful of times got tested about 1 month ago. I told him to keep in touch and he called to let me know he was negative. Although comforting, his results are not entirely conclusive to my own case. My boyfriend and I have had unprotected sex... many times. He has exhibited no signs of an infection and has been perfectly healthy the entirety of our relationship thus far with no ARS.
 
If it's relevant, I took Accutane last year as well where there was routine blood work. This blood work (to my understanding) does not test for STDs or HIV; however, it does monitor other irregularities in blood work. Each doctors visit went smoothly and I was healthy in that respect.
 
I'm not sure how worried I should be. I came here to get things off my chest and make myself feel a little better. I think the worst part of it all is wondering what consequences I may face by endangering my boyfriend's life as well as mine. There's just so much to dwell on! I'm not sure how to make time go any faster. I just want to hear my results and move on. I want to feel safe but it's hard when you know you've made unwise decisions in the past.
 
Can anyone give me their thoughts/opinions? Should I be worried? Is it likely I have HIV?

17zp6v,"Questions about my HIV Test. Please help! (xpost /STD) So some back story so you guys know where I am coming from. On January 16th I had a sexual encounter with a female escort. I arrived at her house and we started to have sexual intercourse. She performed oral sex on me unprotected and then had protected sex with me. We also kissed for about 10 seconds. Stupid thing is I decided to go down on her after and perform oral sex on this female. The room was barely lit but from what I could see I could not see anything wrong with her genital region. There were no warts or cuts and I could not feel anything out of the ordinary. This went on for about 2 mins and then I decided to perform the 69 position with her. During this position I performed oral sex on her and by accident swallowed some of her vaginal fluid. She was also spitting into a cup as she was giving me oral sex, which I found very odd. After we had protected sex and I left. The next day after when I went to go brush my teeth I noticed a blemish on the top and bottoms of my lip. They seem to be several maybe 20-30 white little spots clustered together under the skin. I was very concerned and told a friend about it. He said that it probably was a cold sore and recommended using Lipactin from a local drug store. I used this for about 2 days and found no results. During that 2nd day of the use I started to feel flu like symptoms. I had a sore throat and had trouble sleeping. I would get the chills in the middle of the night. So on January 20th I decided to go in to the walk-in clinic (as I did not have a family doctor) and the doctor diagnosed me for strep throat. She took 3 different swabs, checking for throat gonorrhea, throat chlamydia and strep. As she finished this she prescribed me antibiotics (Penicillin) to take 2 tablets twice daily and just to apply alcohol to my blemishes on my lip. She always advised me to call Public Health Services to get tested. The next day after I went to another doctor for my lip just to see what they had to say. This doctor prescribed me Zovirax Ointment. I used the ointment until it was finished like the doctor said but found no results. During this week I finished my antibiotics and felt as good as new but still had my blemish the same size as I had it the first day. On January 29th I went to go get tested for Herpes Simplex Virus, Hep B, HIV, Gonorrhea and Chlamydia through blood and urine samples. The doctors there said it would take about two weeks for the results to come in. So where I stand now is on February 2nd. Today I went into the doctors as I felt my throat acting up again feeling like it was sore or swollen again. The walk in clinic doctor said I should be fine and probably isn't Herpes, since I've had it for more than 2 weeks and it hasn't opened up yet. His guess was it could of just been a skin reaction to her vagina. I highly doubt that it would be since the blemish looks so different from everything else I've ever seen. I also asked him if it was ok if I kissed anyone while I had these blemishes and he said it was ok as long as I took care of it. [Stopped smoking, stopped eating spicy foods and no alcohol] He also said to apply vaseline on my lips. So the doctor checked my throat and found nothing wrong but I know for a fact that it is hard to swallow food or drink water as of right now. It feels like the first time I had started feeling symptoms of strep.

So basically I just want to know: What these blemishes on my lip could be, and how could I treat them. What are the chances of me contracting an STD orally. And what are the chances of contracting HIV through oral sex with this partner.

I feel very scared and vulnerable at this point. Every night since I had these symptoms its been hard to keep this off my mind. I am constantly thinking about it and searching on the net for more information. Every night it is hard for me to sleep thinking about this. I usually wake up around 3 or 4 am and just can't sleep. I've been to 4 doctors and still don't have solid information. I hope you Redditors can help me out. Thanks in advance.

**I copy pasted most of the information from my post on /r/STD . But now my main concern is really the HIV test that I got back. How accurate is my HIV test. I took a 4th generation HIV combo test (HIV1/2Ag/Ab) and no HIV p24 antigen and no HIV1/2 antibodies were detected.**

*My results came back negative.*

 I got tested exactly 2 weeks after I was suspicious of catching an STD or HIV. Does anyone know when I should go in for testing again just to make sure? I researched the internet that the 4th gen test detects the antibodies as early as 1-4 weeks after infection and for the safe side I should go in at 6 week mark. So what I am basically asking is, should I feel at ease now that the test came back negative after 2 weeks or should I still have a little concern until I take that 6 week test. As I am writing this I have severe stomach pains and I am having the feeling of vomiting. If someone could please respond with a little information I would be very happy and appreciative.** It is really hard to cope with this. My doctor said a 3 month test or even a 6 month test will be way more accurate. But as I said I don't know if I could deal with all this anxiety, stress and symptoms until then. I don't know anymore. I thought I was a strong person. I broke down today and cried over this whole ordeal. For christ sake I am only 20 years old and this is happening over the span of my birthday which is on the 18th of February. If anyone could please tell me anything, I would greatly appreciate it.

vhzhl,"Partner Said He's Positive - Now I'm Freaking Out. Essentially, yesterday at around 6pm, someone I had sex with before (I'm gay, and was the bottom, and we used a condom) called and said he's tested positive for HIV. He has a boyfriend now, and he tested negative. We had sex around the end of March, and he tested negative in April. He also says that me and his boyfriend are the only two people he's slept with in about 9 months, except for a blowjob he says he used a condom for. We used a condom as well.
I was dealing with this fine, as I thought I would be able to go to Planned Parenthood this morning and get tested, but they don't do testing on the weekends. The only place that I can find that might is the Hospital, and they won't release your results for two days so they can get a confirmatory diagnosis. On top of that, they charge a bunch for emergency care fees.
I haven't been tested in about a year, but I keep freaking out that somehow I was the one who gave it to him. If he's being truthful about not sleeping with anyone else, the timeline just makes sense (it takes about 3 months from the point of infection to tell). I know the chances of transmission are low from bottom to top, especially with a condom, but I can't find anything definitive online. One of my friends got drunk with my last night in an attempt to calm me down until this morning, but now I don't think I'll be able to get tested until monday/tuesday, and I have no idea how to wait that long. I live in SWVA if anyone knows of any testing centers on weekends.
Can anyone tell me what to do, or help me out here. Any statistics that might give me more information? I'm terrified right now.",2,2,2012-06-23 18:07:16-04:00,partner said he posit im freak essenti yesterday around pm someon sex im gay bottom use condom call said he test posit hiv boyfriend test neg sex around end march test neg april also say boyfriend two peopl he slept month except blowjob say use condom use condom well deal fine thought would abl go plan parenthood morn get test dont test weekend place find might hospit wont releas result two day get confirmatori diagnosi top charg bunch emerg care fee havent test year keep freak somehow one gave he truth sleep anyon els timelin make sens take month point infect tell know chanc transmiss low bottom top especi condom cant find anyth definit onlin one friend got drunk last night attempt calm morn dont think ill abl get test mondaytuesday idea wait long live swva anyon know test center weekend anyon tell help statist might give inform im terrifi right,"Sentiment(polarity=0.1081085581085581, subjectivity=0.5181318681318682)",0.1081085581085581,positive

To begin I appreciate any answers...

A couple weeks ago I went to a rave, ended up doing MDMA. And chewing my lips. No bleeding wounds but ended up with swollen lips and the skin coming off on the inside. I shared a bottle of water with quite a few people. I don't think there is a chance and am probably working my self up into a panic. But I was recently tested and it came back negative, (this was before the rave). However, I've come down with some cold like symptoms such as a plugged nose and itchy throat. And I had unprotected sex with my wife and she has the same cold maybe a little worse. Chance of exposure?

1qtbyt,"HIV Scare. Please help... So, i've been talking to this guy on Grindr (im gay) for about a week or so now, he's talked about working in an emergency room and how his hours are kind of wack.

Eventually we meet, and I top him bareback. He reassured me that he doesn't have hiv I didnt come in him, but when I asked about a condom he said he had one and i could wear it if i wanted.

1ok9eb,"POZ partner for 9 months and ORAQUICK HIV test. Hi I have a question for any experts out there. I'm a 20 year old male, I was with a 38 year old poz male for 9 months and we had sex regularly (but usually with a condom) over that period of time. I did in fact have unprotected anal sex (he did not ejaculate inside of me any time) with him ~3 times (drunk every time. nice job me!) and swallowed his semen probably about 10-15 times. The only reason I did this other than being drunk was that he's had HIV for 11 years and has been completely undetectable for 6. I have read that the risk involved with someone who has been undetectable for a long time is close to nothing even with unprotected sex.

So we broke up about a month and a half ago and I bought an ORAQUICK test off of Amazon. The packet said that there is an increased chance of inaccuracy unless you wait 3 months. I thought screw it I need some kind of peace of mind and took the test.

Negative. Whew. Relief. Still though, should I still be concerned over my status? Am I being overly paranoid or should I go get a legitimate blood test? I don't want to be irresponsible but I feel like the chances are soooo low that it may be over kill.

Talk some sense in me guys/girls.

wq030,"Reddit, my brother and his wife are trying to adopt an HIV+ child would you be willing to help?
 If this is the wrong subreddit for this, kindly redirect me.

Dear Reddit,
My brother and his wife are currently in the process of adopting a little boy from Uganda. They've been going through this process for a few years.
Here's a little back story.
A year ago, my brother and his wife realized how ridiculously comfortable their lives were. They felt convicted about this and decided to try to share their comfort with children who have literally nothing. They raised money and went to see orphans, both abandoned and parent less, in Uganda. Whilst in Uganda they met a little boy named Paul, who was HIV positive between 6 and 8 years old, who weighed around 30 lbs if I remember correctly. He stole their hearts.
They worked with people there to get him moved to a better orphanage, and started the process of adopting him. 
Sadly, the laws there prevented them from being the right family for them. Their hearts were broken, but they weren't ready to stop trying.
Some friends of theirs new of another little boy in need of a family, also HIV positive, in Uganda, available for adoption. They enthusiastically pursued this. 
Back to present day. The type of adoption is different, initially they were doing a private adoption, but for Levi, it had to be through the agencies. Meaning more expensive and much more fast paced, due to his condition and age.
Basically, what I'm asking is if you feel so called, help them out with 1$ and maybe if we get enough 1$ donations, they can meet their goal.
They need I $14,000 by September to be able to go and get their new son.
Also, wanted to include that HIV+ babies have a much harder time getting adopted even though the condition is completely manageable. 
here is a [link](http://www.projecthopeful.org/waiting-kids/matched-children-and-families#Levi) to donate tax deductible. The link provides more details.
My husband and I are both posting this for more exposure.


TLDR: My brother is trying to adopt from Uganda, Adoption is expensive. Looking to reddit to help out.

Thanks Reddit for being Awesome

1m4eey,"Exposure to hiv has me freaking out Two days ago I was at outside a store smoking a cig, when a bummy looking guy walked by and asked to borrow my lighter. I said sure, let him borrow it and we started talking. In the middle of the conversation my friend walks up and shakes the guys hand. The guy says ""ouch, careful; I have a cut"" and showed us a nasty looking cut across his finger.

We keep chatting and after 5 or so minutes, the guy says he is HIV positive.

We left quickly after that and drove to a Waffle House and washed our hands. 

Starting the morning after, I have a stuffy nose.

I am very paranoid. How likely is it that I rubbed my eye after shaking this mans hand and contracted this disease? I can't remember if I touched my face or not before learning of his HIV..
