q4zeo1,"Please read this before posting about feeling suicidal. There has been an increase in the number of posts of individuals who are feeling suicidal. And to be perfectly honest, it‚Äôs the beginning of a new school year, most of us have been isolated, scared, lonely, and there‚Äôs a lot of uncertainty in the world due to COVID.

Unfortunately, most of us in this community are not trained to handle mental health crises. While I and a handful of others are licensed professionals, an anonymous internet forum is not the best place to really provide the correct amount of help and support you need.

That being said, I‚Äôm not surprised that many of us in this community are struggling. For those who are struggling, you are not alone. I may be doing well now, but I have two attempts and OCD was a huge factor.

I have never regretted being stopped.

Since you are thinking of posting for help, you won't regret stopping yourself.

So, right now everything seems dark and you don‚Äôt see a way out. That‚Äôs ok. However, I guarantee you there is a light. Your eyes just have not adjusted yet.

So what can you do in this moment when everything just seems awful.

First off, if you have a plan and you intend on carrying out that plan, I very strongly suggest going to your nearest ER. If you do not feel like you can keep yourself safe, you need to be somewhere where others can keep you safe. Psych hospitals are not wonderful places, they can be scary and frustrating. but you will be around to leave the hospital and get yourself moving in a better direction.

If you are not actively planning to suicide but the thought is very loud and prominent in your head, let's start with some basics. When‚Äôs the last time you had food or water? Actual food; something with vegetables, grains, and protein. If you can‚Äôt remember or it‚Äôs been more than 4 to 5 hours, eat something and drink some water. Your brain cannot work if it does not have fuel.

Next, are you supposed to be sleeping right now? If the answer is yes go to bed. Turn on some soothing music or ambient sounds so that you can focus on the noise and the sounds rather than ruminating about how bad you feel.

If you can‚Äôt sleep, try progressive muscle relaxation or some breathing exercises. Have your brain focus on a scene that you find relaxing such as sitting on a beach and watching the waves rolling in or sitting by a brook and listening to the water. Go through each of your five senses and visualize as well as imagine what your senses would be feeling if you were in that space.

If you‚Äôre hydrated, fed, and properly rested, ask yourself these questions when is the last time you talked to an actual human being? And I do mean talking as in heard their actual voice. Phone calls count for this one. If it‚Äôs been a while. Call someone. It doesn‚Äôt matter who, just talk to an actual human being.

Go outside. Get in nature. This actually has research behind it. There is a bacteria or chemical in soil that also happens to be in the air that has mood boosting properties. There are literally countries where doctors will prescribe going for a walk in the woods to their patients.

When is the last time you did something creative? If depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder have gotten in the way of doing creative things that you love, pull out that sketchbook or that camera and just start doing things.

When‚Äôs the last time you did something kind for another human being? This may just be me as a social worker, but doing things for others, helps me feel better. So figure out a place you can volunteer and go do it.

When is the last time that you did something pleasurable just for pleasure's sake? Read a book take a bath. You will have to force yourself to do something but that‚Äôs OK.

You have worth and you can get through this. Like I said I have had two attempts and now I am a licensed social worker. Things do get better, you just have to get through the dark stuff first.

You will be ok and you can make it through this.

We are all rooting for you.",67,1009,2021-10-09 22:33:00-04:00,pleas read post feel suicid increas number post individu feel suicid perfectli honest it‚Äô begin new school year us isol scare lone there‚Äô lot uncertainti world due covid unfortun us commun train handl mental health crise hand other licens profession anonym internet forum best place realli provid correct amount help support need said i‚Äôm surpris mani us commun struggl struggl alon may well two attempt ocd huge factor never regret stop sinc think post help wont regret stop right everyth seem dark don‚Äôt see way that‚Äô ok howev guarante light eye adjust yet moment everyth seem aw first plan intend carri plan strongli suggest go near er feel like keep safe need somewher other keep safe psych hospit wonder place scari frustrat around leav hospit get move good direct activ plan suicid thought loud promin head let start basic when‚Äô last time food water actual food someth veget grain protein can‚Äôt rememb it‚Äô hour eat someth drink water brain cannot work fuel next suppos sleep right answer ye go bed turn sooth music ambient sound focu nois sound rather rumin bad feel can‚Äôt sleep tri progress muscl relax breath exercis brain focu scene find relax sit beach watch wave roll sit brook listen water go five sens visual well imagin sens would feel space you‚Äôr hydrat fed properli rest ask question last time talk actual human mean talk heard actual voic phone call count one it‚Äô call someon doesn‚Äôt matter talk actual human go outsid get natur actual research behind bacteria chemic soil also happen air mood boost properti liter countri doctor prescrib go walk wood patient last time someth creativ depress obsessivecompuls disord gotten way creativ thing love pull sketchbook camera start thing when‚Äô last time someth kind anoth human may social worker thing other help feel good figur place volunt go last time someth pleasur pleasur sake read book take bath forc someth that‚Äô ok worth get like said two attempt licens social worker thing get good get dark stuff first ok make root,"Sentiment(polarity=0.1554683742183742, subjectivity=0.35688532146865476)",0.1554683742183742,positive

txh7q9,"so fucking tired of this shit (TW) I have just realised after almost 7 years that it is not a good idea to talk about this shit to anyone IRL not even other sufferers lest they think you're a true monster. If you suffer from it severely enough there is absolutely no chance of coming out of it without suffering some serious social consequences. OCD of a content about some sort of harm either to yourself or others involving the most defenseless people in society is not something most will take lightly. Now add in being severly depersonalized and derealized and voila, we have a real tragedy here. 

Prior to this shit, I always saw myself as a good person and I assume that most of the people that knew me would aggree with me. Now if I was to ever call myself a good person, I would get laughed in my face (has happened before). Once this is over which it will be because I'm now having more insight and feel more grounded in reality, I will have to go elsewhere because there is no way in hell I will experience any happiness here it feels almost as bad as being accused of some horrendous crime, I can't imagine anyone feeling comfortable with my presence. 

I will probably end up being alone because how can I explain something like this to any person at all? I have tried in the past and the only people who have stayed are those who have felt like they could use me to some benefit either financial or some sexual thing like ""you're down for whatever"" which I am not. I won't commit suicide the moment for that is long gone but it will be a long time waiting to die being a fairly youngish woman. There may be some other things I can focus my life on if I ever managed to restore any self esteem of feeling like I am deserving to even breathe but for now I give up.

txj1ah,"struggling i‚Äôve been dealing with OCD since 2018 but between then and now i have suffered from 2 different themes. the first one, i was put on medication and eventually i got better and the intrusive thoughts barely bothered me. well at the end of 2020, beginning of 2021, it started back up and now i have a fear of going üë©‚Äçü¶Ø (i don‚Äôt even like to say it) and i recently started back up with my medication (fluoxetine) but i am just overwhelmed. at first it was hard for me to wash my hands and shower without goggles bc i was scared i was going to get soap in my eyes but eventually i overcame that. but i am still deathly afraid of using chemicals or having chemicals be used around the house. yesterday i tried to wash my bedding by myself again (my mom has been helping me recently) and i was panicking and freaking out for hours that i got detergent all over me and somehow got in my eyes and that it‚Äôs still on my blankets and sheets. i haven‚Äôt slept yet (it‚Äôs 6:15am) due to constantly washing my hands after touching my blanket. my mom and my brother had to constantly tell me that there‚Äôs nothing on me or my blanket (i know reassurance is not good for OCD) and i even asked them to touch it and then touch their eyes. (nothing happened) but it feels so extremely real and i can‚Äôt convince myself otherwise. it‚Äôs so hard for me to do anything without worrying if something is going to happen to my eyes. just to rub my eyes i have to make sure my hands are clean and that i haven‚Äôt touched anything. my hands are so wrinkled and have cuts on them and my skin is so dry. i put lotion on but i usually end up washing my hands again after. 

oh also, i often get sensations in my eyes after using or being around a substance that i fear going in my eyes. for example, after i did my laundry i had a weird feeling in my eye and that was one of the reasons i was convinced detergent was in it. however, the detergent was nowhere near my face. i know that it wasn‚Äôt but the physical sensation combined with the thoughts led me to believe something was wrong.

txirxc,"Question regarding relative Hey all,

so my brother has developed some behaviours which i strongly think are OCD (eg. showering & changing clothes every single time before entering his room) and after those behaviours weird physical issues started (extreme sensitivity & lung pains from miniscule amounts of smoke, headache & eye pain from monitors, neon tubes, etc and headaches from active WLAN or bluetooth devices). Those issues only got worse with time.

The problem is, all this comes with a quite narcissistic, egoistic personality, he is very closed off towards me & family, completely refuses any mention of him having a problem or that he needs professional help. And ""of course no doctor could ever help him because they are all shit and he knows better than everybody else anyway"".

So i wanted to ask 2 questions:

twzmbj,"need advice: honesty with my therapist ‚Ä¢Topic: sexual OCD

I'm about to visit a therapist but I feel distrust in telling them all I think and feel. I have a little of magic and contamination ocd but the most concerning topics to me are false memory and sexual OCD. I created with time a fear of being sexually attracted to people I actually don't even like and that sort of things. But I have another fear too, about crossing limits with people, making them sexually uncomfortable, harassing them unintentionally, all that stuff. It has bothered me for a long time. Now I'm really rigorous with people, sometimes when I'm close to them I wonder, "" I didn't hurt them right?"" ""Did I make something weird and I don't remember?"" This triggered me about three times, and I didn't have the tools to ignore those worries, so I created false memories through my imagination to prove if I have done bad things or not. Deep down I know I didn't do those things, and I never thought before about doing them, there's no desire or intrusive thoughts making me believe I would want that. But my brain can't distinguish between real memories and imagination anymore, I over exploited it without knowing that was the opposite I had to do. I found patterns between these three cases and most of my ocd worries, my false memory ocd operates always the same way and thank god I can recognize its ocd doing its job. But this is my question, can I just tell my therapist about this? What if they make me believe I actually did these things or if they misinterpret me? It seems like not all therapist are aware about sexual ocd and some of them made their patients believe their worries were real.

 That feeling that feels this confirms the thought is like a door in your brain opening and making all these thoughts attaching to you whilst thinking the thoughts you want to think your brain feels closed.

Ive heard of emotional contamination ocd and it is when you associate bad qualities in item or person to contaminate you.

txlai6,"Could this be ocd? So pretty much I do boxing and I was a bit slow with getting hang of the most basic punch. In fact I never really got the hang of it. It‚Äôs so simple but after some time I could do it but not that good. Anyways since it took me so long to get the get the hang of it I‚Äôd randomly get thoughts like ‚Äúwhat if you can‚Äôt do it?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat if you‚Äôve forgot‚Äù so I‚Äôd get worried and have to check, then I‚Äôd check, ok nothing wrong.

So I checked ok fine, then I kept checking but since I was so focused on how to throw it I was in a hesitant state I threw it wrong. Then I start worrying even more would constantly do it non stop. But I kept overanalysing the punch punch and kept throwing it wrong, I‚Äôd keep on doing it but wouldn‚Äôt get anywhere so I‚Äôd stop, then feel like shit for weeks until I figured out how to do it again, I‚Äôd keep analysing the technique in my head trying to figure out what was wrong since I felt so desperate and worried and could feel at ease. Then I‚Äôd do it right and think I did it a certain way. Then I‚Äôd keep getting those thoughts and feelings again making me constantly check to make sure I could still do it. Then I throw it wrong again, then this whole cycle happens again about 20-30 times over 7-8 months. Until I realised that it‚Äôs the most basic punch, so why am I over analysing it? I see other people do it so casually but me? I act as if it‚Äôs the most complicated thing in life. I figured this out after going to a session and just going out on the bag with a Fuck it mentality even though I had so much doubt that I wasn‚Äôt able to do it and I was actually killing it. I knew how to do it I was throwing combos. And that happened almost a month ago, this is the longest amount of time I‚Äôve been able to do it without being in that cycle.

And I‚Äôd check less and when I did everything fine. I get the feelings pretty much everyday as well. But when I check I act like there‚Äôs no right way to do it so I don‚Äôt think I just throw it however I throw it and it‚Äôs all fine. But today I kept getting those thoughts and feelings and kept checking, everything fine. Until I did it and thought so much I threw it wrong once.

I have lists usually of what needs to be done because it helps me feel organized.

I get terrified now walking home from work as crossing busy roads is actually unavoidable. I've been getting the bus home recently but I see this as just a form of avoidance. I just feel so terrified that the anxiety and urges actually seem so real, it's impossible to explain it. I actually feel very dizzy and breathless because it's like something in my brain is saying ""just do it, it's easy, just do it"" even though this is obviously something I don't want to do. I am not suicidal and I don't ""hear voices"". 

I've tried finding out more about this online but can't seem to find anything related to specifically this but i would imagine it's another form of Harm ocd. I just think it's unavoidable and hard to deal with as walking over busy roads is a genuinely perilous situation for everyone if people aren't paying attention etc. I just get this strange feeling as I'm walking like ""you could easily just walk in front of that oncoming car and get hit and die"" and what is so horrifying I actually feel like my body is somewhat swaying towards the road. Its like a battle even though as I said I am not suicidal and don't want to hurt myself. 

I suppose I'm just writing to see if anyone else has had something very similar and if so, how did you deal with it. I can't avoid walking along pavements or across roads forever. It feels like maybe a form of panic disorder or something but it's dreadful as i can't remember the last time i walked to and from work without anxiety.

txd248,"I Just Need A Place To Vent It seems like occasionally I write I am here because I get to a point where I can no longer handle it on my own anymore.

Sometimes I'm afraid that OCD will literally be the end of me. I'm **NOT** going to kill myself but I think about it a lot and I've become more jaded towards the idea. At one point I thought that meant that eventually I might. All I know is that I'm determined to live even if I'd rather not.

I don't know who I am anymore. I don't know if the person in my head is real? Am I doing, saying, and feeling things because that's what I want? How do I know what I want?

As always and still 7 years on: my guilt is destroying me. It hurts and at this point I don't know if I deserve to or even want to continue on. I know that I wish I was someone else, someone better, someone who hasn't made the mistakes I've made. All I can do at this point is make sure I only ever treat people kindly regardless of what's in my head.

I never wanted to be this person. There are no excuses, no redos, there is just now, and then there's tomorrow. I don't enjoy being me, as I am. I enjoy the idea is being a version of me free from my wrongdoings.

Every time I make a new friend, all I can think about is how I need to stop being their friend. They deserve better than me and I don't want them to look back on time spent with disgust and sadness because they spent it with, who should be considered, a pariah.

I'm on a waiting list for therapy and maybe that will help. Until then I want to do bad things to myself as a punishment. I just know that I won't because I'm not supposed to and I'm too tired to try.

txad49,"My Teeth Have Taken Over My Life I guess I'd like to start by saying that I'm really nervous to make this post, but at this point I think it's necessary. Please don't judge me for any of what I'm about to say because I'm already extremely self-conscious about it.

I constantly obsess over my dental health, and I often feel the need to spend an excessive amount of time brushing and flossing each day. On average, I'll spend 4 to 6 hours flossing each night, and around 30 minutes brushing twice a day. It really stresses me out having to stand for so long, and the outside of my mouth gets sore from having it open for such a long time.

It doesn't stop there either, it also influences the way I eat. Whenever I eat, I have to do it within a certain amount of time. If I'm eating something that I consider to be bad for my teeth, I simply won't chew it. In addition to this, I always vigorously rinse my mouth with water and chew a piece of sugar-free gum after every meal to make sure my mouth is clean. I also always drink water throughout the day, and I get very anxious if my mouth starts to get dry.

The main reason I think I do it is because I didn't take the best care of my teeth when I was younger, and I worry that if my teeth ever get bad, no one will love me or want to be friends with me. I know it's irrational, but that's just the way I think. My family tells me I'm a very good looking guy, and they think my teeth look fine, but I can't help but not believe it. I also have severe social anxiety, and I never leave the house unless I have an appointment.

I'm going to turn 18 a week from now, and I'm so worried that this will be the rest of my life. It kills me being so alone, and I just want to move forward with my life. At this point I feel like there's really something wrong with me and that I'm unlovable. I'm afraid of practically everything, and it all just feels so hopeless.

txdyel,"Developing an obsessive/compulsive relationship with my idol? In these past few weeks I quit weightlifting ‚Äî it was my passion for about a year, I never had to see a therapist or take antidepressants during this time. Before I started, my mental health was pretty shaky but nothing more than normal high strung young woman stuff. 

I started to listen to kpop to fuel my workouts and I would watch run bts on the treadmill to pass the time so kpop became a staple in my life. Since I quit weightlifting, I have developed a weird obsession with some of my idols (one in particular). 

I created a separate account to post about her. I constantly watch videos where people try her suspected idol diet. I get anxious when I close my computer and I‚Äôm not watching something about her. I have never exhibited obsessive behavior (especially about a person) regarding something like this before. I just made an Instagram account so I can have her notifications on and I‚Äôm feeling really ashamed and embarrassed because all of my friends know me as a person who hates Instagram and social media in general. I‚Äôm not even necessarily obsessed with who she is, just with how she looks. I feel like I constantly have to look at her or see her or study her visual. 

My mental health in general has been on a runaway train since I stopped weightlifting and this is by far the most embarrassing manifestation of it. I don‚Äôt have OCD but I don‚Äôt know where else to post this. Does anyone know how I can get myself out of this loop? I feel like I do nothing all day but let noise about her play in the background.

i refused to clear the chat, because i did not want to enable their compulsions or reinforce the idea that me doing this would be the only way to resolve their anxiety. i feel horrible because i knew this would increase their anxiety. i acknowledged this and told them the reason i said this is because i care for them and want to see them overcome this, and offered to listen. however, now i worry it wasn‚Äôt my place to say that, that they are upset with me now or what i said was selfish, or maybe they will feel like they can‚Äôt trust me?

I've been getting better about it lately, partly because scrubbing the heck out of my clothes is so taxing, and a growing pile is so daunting.

Now I've got to ask--is handwashing and scrubbing clothes really making that big of a difference compared to using the wash machine alone? Does anyone have any knowledge on the difference?

tx42oa,"Am I going crazy?!?!? I‚Äôll keep this as short as possible. I was hanging out with my best friend and one of his friends. His friend made fun of someone‚Äôs stutter and he was unaware I stuttered. After that I went home and cried because I felt like I would always be defined by my stutter and had to hide it. I felt like if I showed my stutter then I wouldn‚Äôt know who I could trust to be my real friends (I was also having a bad day with anxiety already)

I felt crazy thinking this way but a few days later I thought ‚Äúeverybody can be made fun of for things like disabilities, sexuality, religion, etc, so why worry about it?‚Äù And I began to let it go. But someone on a post I made about it said they became paranoid and went into psychosis cause they were worrying if others were talking behind their back. And in my post I mentioned ‚Äúhow do I know if someone talks behind my back about my stutter?‚Äù. So when I read this I almost had a panic attack and it took almost an hour to get off the edge of a panic attack. And my anxiety was rapid for 2-5 days 

I eventually realized most wont make fun it and I can tell what type of person someone is whine their around me. But my OCD got ahold of this thought and thinks about random people I work with and I get thoughts like ‚Äúis [blank] the type of person to make fun of me?‚Äù. I tell myself no but I keep repeating that thought to convince myself I don‚Äôt believe them. It‚Äôs more like now I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll believe people are making fun of me then people actually making fun of me

This happened almost 3 weeks ago and I‚Äôm still obsessed with my stutter, but now it‚Äôs mostly for a different reason. I realized most people won‚Äôt care if I stutter and some even enjoy it. I just have to change my perspective and mindset on it. I realize I‚Äôm SO CLOSE to no longer being insecure about my stutter, but I can‚Äôt seem to change my mindset. I sometimes even find my stutter funny, so I want to be ok with people making fun or laughing at it. And I wanna be ok if they make fun of it behind my back because I‚Äôll be way happier. But a part of me can‚Äôt be ok with it but if I could be I would no longer be insecure of my stutter. So I‚Äôm so close but can‚Äôt change my mindset. And that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve been so obsessed with it. The fact I‚Äôm so close to being free from my insecurity but I‚Äôm not moving closer to it. And the fact I‚Äôm so obsessed with it makes me feel like I‚Äôm going crazy and makes me anxious because I feel like I‚Äôm losing my mind

Folks, it is absolutely the gold standard treatment. It‚Äôs challenging as heck, but there is a 0% chance that your OCD clears up on its own without putting in the hard work. Your partner should be supporting you in any way they can be, even if some of it makes them uncomfy.

Remember that you deserve someone who will weather the storm with you and go through that discomfort to support you. If you don‚Äôt have that, find someone better.

i was panicking about like ‚Äúwhat if you were into this intrusive thought‚Äù and i cant remember anything at all but i think it made me feel like weirdly positive about it but vaguely, for a fraction of a second, i felt like i was into this vile thought or my mind made me feel this or WHATEVER it was but i have not been able to get over it. thinking about it makes me panic. i dont understand why this happened and i dont even wanna think about it because ill spiral but im so terrified. i keep trying to remember anything about it at all and when it happened or if anything even happened at all and i just CANT no matter how hard i try, and i cant even replicate the feeling in my mind of liking that awful thing. it literally doesnt feel real. i dont know why this happened because this thought utterly DISGUSTS me and i was legit in the middle of freaking out about if i liked it or something because it scared me

tx05qg,"Am I going crazy?!?!? I‚Äôll keep this as short as possible. I was hanging out with my best friend and one of his friends. His friend made fun of someone‚Äôs stutter and he was unaware I stuttered. After that I went home and cried because I felt like I would always be defined by my stutter and had to hide it. I felt like if I showed my stutter then I wouldn‚Äôt know who I could trust to be my real friends (I was also having a bad day with anxiety already)

I felt crazy thinking this way but a few days later I thought ‚Äúeverybody can be made fun of for things like disabilities, sexuality, religion, etc, so why worry about it?‚Äù And I began to let it go. But someone on a post I made about it said they became paranoid and went into psychosis cause they were worrying if others were talking behind their back. And in my post I mentioned ‚Äúhow do I know if someone talks behind my back about my stutter?‚Äù. So when I read this I almost had a panic attack and it took almost an hour to get off the edge of a panic attack. And my anxiety was rapid for 2-5 days 

I eventually realized most wont make fun it and I can tell what type of person someone is whine their around me. But my OCD got ahold of this thought and thinks about random people I work with and I get thoughts like ‚Äúis [blank] the type of person to make fun of me?‚Äù. I tell myself no but I keep repeating that thought to convince myself I don‚Äôt believe them. It‚Äôs more like now I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll believe people are making fun of me then people actually making fun of me

This happened almost 3 weeks ago and I‚Äôm still obsessed with my stutter, but now it‚Äôs mostly for a different reason. I realized most people won‚Äôt care if I stutter and some even enjoy it. I just have to change my perspective and mindset on it. I realize I‚Äôm SO CLOSE to no longer being insecure about my stutter, but I can‚Äôt seem to change my mindset. I sometimes even find my stutter funny, so I want to be ok with people making fun or laughing at it. And I wanna be ok if they make fun of it behind my back because I‚Äôll be way happier. But a part of me can‚Äôt be ok with it but if I could be I would no longer be insecure of my stutter. So I‚Äôm so close but can‚Äôt change my mindset. And that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve been so obsessed with it. The fact I‚Äôm so close to being free from my insecurity but I‚Äôm not moving closer to it. And the fact I‚Äôm so obsessed with it makes me feel like I‚Äôm going crazy and makes me anxious because I feel like I‚Äôm losing my mind

It‚Äôs now been 1 month on since trying Risperidone for my severe contamination OCD and whilst I‚Äôm happy I don‚Äôt have any side effects (yet), I also feel very little relief. I have been prescribed 0.5 in the mornings and 0.5 in the afternoons. 

I‚Äôve had around 3 days where I‚Äôve felt really down and my thoughts were more severe than ever before. My boobs seem to be bigger to which I‚Äôve read could be to do with prolactin levels?? 

I was hoping the way it works would make me less agitated when starting exposure work or with compulsions. 

The real exposure work should of started this week under a lead care professional who will visit me face to face on Friday, but I‚Äôm still too scared to even start the smallest of exposures. (Picking a hair band off the floor, and putting it in my hair and makeup draw, not wash my hands). To me, my home floor has dog poo on from work shoes that were worn 4 years ago, following a colleagues footsteps who actually stood in dog poo, then I brought the ‚Äúgerms‚Äù back home and trampled it everywhere in my own home. 

I have a review this week, but interested in your input, should I keep going on it for my exposure work or sack it off if it‚Äôs providing next to no relief? I still get relief from clonazepam on an as and when basis.

Any thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated! Thank you so much üíñ

twngms,"Help! Any tips for ocd? I am trying this **new mindset**:

""I should not try to control my OCD, I should always expect the worst. My goal should not be: to control it.""

**Problem:**

If I'm anxious, then I stop tolerating the new mindset and nothing impacts my OCD thought anymore. I only want to be impacted by convincing arguments, while I'm justifying my OCD.

**Result:**

So I start expecting a good outcome. Then if I fail, it will reinforce doubt and I feel bothered by it. I suddenly start to believe in my OCD thought, I want it, I need it, I make it easy. I start attaching excuses to my OCD thought to justify it. I often forget, so then the OCD thought and reassurance-seeking trigger my compulsion unconsciously. 

**Question:**

Any tips to detach doubt that is unreasonable? (other than breathing, meditation, medication or moving away my focus)

How can I reduce negative emotional responses?

How can I continue with my activity, even though I have doubt?

How can I stop seeing my thought as a warning sign to which I need to respond to?

How can I stop taking my thoughts seriously and stop engaging?

twkaqe,"Can someone please read through my experience and tell me if it even sounds at all like OCD? I'm struggling so much and don't know where to go for answers. So before I got into the hellacious state I am currently in, I just had bad anxiety, especially performance anxiety, with lots of concentration and short-term memory issues. Someone would tell me something at school, and 10 seconds later, I couldn't remember what they told me, and I had/have lots of issues recalling words and putting my thoughts into sentences. Lots of issues just zoning out throughout the day as well, then realizing I've been nodding along for the past 20 seconds as someone talked to me. After several full neurologic workups to make sure there wasn't anything like a brain tumor going on, I sought out therapy because numerous doctors told me that my cognitive issues were because you can't think straight when you have anxiety as bad as I do.

I tried a few therapists who told me things like do breathing exercises, focus on the positive, etc., and that never really got me anywhere in terms of reducing my symptoms.

Then I found mental health TikTok. I noticed a lot of the therapists on there emphasized the need to ""feel your feelings,"" and no emotions are ""bad,"" they're all just human emotions. There's lots of stuff on there about processing childhood trauma as well, which I began to wonder if I needed to do. One video in particular talked about how pushing down your feelings rather than letting yourself feel them and express them to others leads to stress and anxiety, and I started thinking about all of the times something happened that upset me or hurt me and I chose to tell myself things like ""Don't let them get you down,"" or just be in denial about the fact that it made me feel bad.

This led me to the realization (or so I thought) that the reason I had such bad anxiety was I was terrified of feeling ""bad"" emotions, and if I just let myself feel them instead of being so avoidant of them or in denial, I would be more emotionally and mentally healthy and just live a more authentic life where I could form deeper connections with others.

Around the same time, I decided to seek out another therapist, this one a trauma specialist, and told him about the chaotic environment in which I had grown up. He told me that I had complex PTSD, and that's why I had so many issues with being hypervigilant all of the time. However, he never really asked me to discuss my past experiences with child abuse, watching my mom be abused, and the like because I also had some important interviews coming up, and I asked him if we could first focus on ways to help me be less anxious and come across more confident in those interviews. Thus, we spent a lot of time discussing things like mindfulness exercises, breathing exercises, and him just listening to me vent while I talked about how hard it was for me to concentrate on things like filling out my applications for the positions I would soon be interviewing for and how worried I was I wouldn't be able to recall words or just not be an anxious wreck during the interviews.

Meanwhile, I had the idea in the back of my head that I had to ""feel my emotions,"" and ""process my trauma"" if I ever wanted to heal and be a functional, well-grounded person, so I started spending a lot of time literally just thinking about past experiences, forcing myself to feel sad or angry, etc, and imagining what it would be like to discuss them with a safe, validating person when I finally did get to the trauma processing part of therapy.

This is where things got wonky.

First, my brain took the concepts of ""no emotions are bad"" and ""having and sharing negative emotions makes us human and connects us with others"" and ""it's good to let yourself feel your uncomfortable emotions,"" and turned it into this constant intrusive thought that ""experiencing bad things is good since it makes us human after alll, and vice versa and it's bad to seek out pleasurable experiences or to do things to avoid having things happen that will result in bad feelings."" It overtook my thinking basically every second I was awake and would interfere with my interactions with others because they'd be telling me about this bad thing they were trying to avoid happening or asking for my advice on how to prevent the bad thing, and my brain would just be coming at me nonstop with this idea that can basically be summarized as ""bad things are good and good things are bad.""

Makes no sense, huh? Yeah, I knew it made no sense, and thus I tried as hard as possible to ignore the thought until my brain got tired of it. Meanwhile, I became progressively distressed to the point that I think I just started to slip into depersonalization/derealization (or maybe just plain dissociation idk) where I felt completely disconnected from everyone around me and I lost all interest in things that used to bring me joy or that just made me ""me"" like my interests.

I stopped hanging out with others because 1) I didn't feel any desire to and 2) I felt like people could tell something was wrong when they were around me. Well, in the process of spending virtually all of my time alone, the nonsensical, intrusive (if that's even the right word?) thoughts began to morph. I used to be very, very interested in things like social justice, and the fact that these topics no longer interested me (along with like any other topic) led to the idea that ""What if I'm actually a really bad, self-absorbed person."" I began to obsess over all of the times I did things that were purely in my own interest like did a volunteer gig I didn't really feel like doing because I knew it would look good on my resume for the field I hope to go into, all of the nice handbags and shoes I bought myself, my low-key obsession with my weight and makeup out of a desire to feel physically attractive, the fact that I was sad that my parents couldn't come to my college graduation because I wanted to feel like people were proud of my accomplishments, any time I complained to a business about a problem I encountered with their services hoping they would do something to make it up like give me a free sandwich or whatever, the list goes on. A related obsession was that I started to feel like I had to be perfectly sweet and nice all of the time and never make a snarky comment about something or say anything negative about anyone even if they did something to hurt me because that would make me a bad person.

So now I feel like I don't even remember what it's like to have my authentic personality because of course no one is bubbly and positive 100% of the time. And I also have lost the ability to just live like authentically and in the moment, allowing emotions to occur naturally, due to the whole ""feel your feelings"" thing that made me obsessed with the nature of emotions themselves. I wake up having a panic attack a lot of the time, and my days are spent researching trying to get to the bottom of how to fix my brain so I can be a functional human again.

There are some other themes, if you will, that have kind of bounced around my head ever since this started, but I'll leave it at that since this is already super long and I'd be lucky if one person read it lol.

They had religious symbolism that i often find cool (i think it‚Äôs because i have religious trauma idk i guess it‚Äôs a coping mechanism). But i dig deeper into the style and soon encountered weird paintings with themes that i don‚Äôt want to share. Found many artists that painted disturbing things (i‚Äôm used to seeing ‚Äòdisturbing‚Äô things in art, such as blood or religious symbolism; but these were just unacceptable. I don‚Äôt want to elaborate). I liked the aesthetic and the palette color and suddenly i associated that combo of colors with something bad. Then i looked through the art i liked, some with those same tonalities of color and similar painting style and started to feel nauseous. I started to feel nauseous at anything that had any similarity, no matter how small or irrelevant with *those* weird paintings that i stumbled upon. I know how to deal with intrusive thoughts but this feel of utter disgust and shame i do not know how to manage. I started to despise the art i used to like, the colors etc and i fear i might fixate on this and run away from anything that reminds me of those *weird* paintings and artists. I don‚Äôt know how to stop it it feels asphyxiating and if i do not stay away from the things that reminded me of *those* paintings i will go mad. It‚Äôs this huge guilt. 

Something that i fixate on also is that i when started to look at these paintings i liked some of them that hadn‚Äôt anything bad. But saw others from the same artists that were simply nauseous. Then my brain associated everything and here i am. I can‚Äôt exist in peace. 

Does this extreme guilt, shame and this feeling that you are a disgusting monster also haunts someone else? I feel like my brain it‚Äôs always trying to tell me that i‚Äôm a monster, that i‚Äôm gross. It will do the greatest mental gymnastics and create emotions to convince me. It works most of the time.

I went home and started crying because I felt as tho anyone could make fun of it and I wouldn‚Äôt know. And I felt like this gave me even more reason to hide my stutter and didn‚Äôt know who I could really be friends with

I eventually realized anyone can be made fun of for anything and was feeling good, but I realized this thought I had about not knowing who I could trust was unhealthy and it made me anxious to the point where I almost had a panic attack cause I was worried I was going crazy (I have OCD and anxiety about going crazy, even if I‚Äôm not). This made me incredibly anxious for like 4-5 days. All this has been almost 3 weeks ago and my stutter is all I can think about, but in a different way

I truly wanna be happy with my stutter and accept myself. And to do this I need to not hide my stutter anymore, I wanna be happy with who I truly am and as a result, almost every second of everyday is me trying to figure out how I can accept myself and not care if I stutter

I wanna learn to not get offended if someone makes fun of my stutter to my face or while I‚Äôm not around. I wanna be ok if they smile or laugh at it. But I don‚Äôt know how I can be.

tweluz,"How to best support partner with contamination fears/rituals as they wait to begin treatment? My partner (who I live with) has OCD that flared up badly with the pandemic. In the beginning it was like the healthcare professionals were telling us to do things she's been actively trying to stop herself from doing her whole life. 

Right now, she changes her clothes when she comes inside and insists on wiping groceries and other things that come in from outside. We've talked extensively about how she needs to go back to treatment (ERP/CBT), and she is currently on medications. 

We cannot find a therapist who does ERP or CBT on our insurance in our area right now. We cannot afford out of pocket right now, and she is on a waiting list now for a therapist, in non-CBT therapy currently with someone who clearly does not get OCD.

twnanv,"Struggling the past 3 months TL;DR: 2 1/2 hour compulsive shower and obsessive hand washing that can take 20 minutes to an hour. Terrified of how much I'm struggling with this. I want to be crafty again, but have lost interest in my hobbies because of this.

Does this get better? Does anyone have any tips? To those who have found help, how long did it take to feel some sense of normalcy again?

-----

So, I'm undiagnosed currently, but feel very strongly that I have OCD and am going to see a doctor about it very soon.

During stressful times in my life I have a compulsive counting habit, especially when it comes to washing my hands (I used to swirl the bar of soap in my hands 13 times, etc.) and bathing (counting every washing movement while bathing).

During the past two years, with covid and everything, it's gotten really bad. Hand washing and ""cleanliness"" are the worst for me. I use "" because it's not a cleaning habit, per se, but a fear of germs. I feel the need to wipe down all of my purchases as soon as I come home from the store. My boyfriend isn't as worried about germs, and his cleaning isn't as persistent, so it freaks me out very often.

It was getting better in November 2020. I tried using the thought process ""he isn't getting sick so I'll just do what he does."" Then, he got covid right after Thanksgiving. We quarantined and I cooked and cleaned, but we only have one bathroom. I was terrified of getting sick and I think it's when my ocd kicked back into gear, but it didn't get really bad until about 3 or 4 months ago.

I started a new job back in November, after not being able to find work for over a year. About a month later I had my ADHD med dosage upped to try to help me focus on my work better, but I think it may have made my OCD worse.

For the past 3 or 4 months it takes me 1-2 1/2 hours to shower and I've caught myself washing my hands for 20 minutes to even an hour. I can't stand this. It terrifies me. I'm working remotely now, but am supposed to work in person later this year. I don't want to seem unproductive at work, wasting time in the bathroom, and I don't want to waste hours of my time every day showering.

These tendencies have caused me to become really depressed. Things I used to have interest in (crafts, writing, etc.) I rarely do anymore. I feel like I'm losing control and I'm struggling so much. Lately I've had so many panic attacks (probably at least one a week for the past few weeks). I've found myself hyperventilating and crying for no real reason.

twik10,"dealing with anger. Hey again,

I just wrote [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tna3ai/i_dunno_if_this_is_an_ocd_thing_music_and/) a bunch of days ago, kept waiting for the right time to sort through comments when my brain could handle it, and that time kinda never came so instead of resurrecting a 10 day old thread I just wanted to give a special thanks to everyone who commented, literally every comment gave me stuff to think about.

My post today has nothing to do with that though.

It's also going to go into some details about the situation in Ukraine, as well as struggles with religion and belief in god and other existential stuff, so... if any of that can be triggering or stressful, skip this post.

Bottom line is, I don't know the proper way to deal with anger and I feel like I'm just getting angrier and angrier. 

I've had more shitty therapists than good ones in my years dealing with all this, and they've never helped whenever I've brought up anger things. Even just asking whether anger is something that can 'build up' over time that *needs* to be vented, or if it's something that does not build up over time. I had one therapist tell me yes and then no *during the same session.*

And the few times I've brought this up around my current therapist or even friends lately, it's been met with a bit of a surprised reaction, to the effect of ""**you**? angry?""

Yeah. Yes. 

It's there. It's buried down and I don't know what to do with it but I know it's there. 

Because occasionally it comes out. When I recently had a very promising phone intake session with a new therapist, while I'd been trying very hard to find one, only to learn right at the end that she was a Christian counselor (due to my past I do not want a Christian counselor as a therapist).

After the convo ended, I grabbed the blankets on my bed and screamed into them as I cried my eyes out. ""Frustrated"" doesn't cut it anymore as a description. The screaming and crying went on for a few minutes until it finally started subsiding.

I've often described things in my life lately as feeling like the butt of a cosmic joke. I really do feel sometimes like my life is a cruel joke that some type of god out there is playing on me. I have been struggling for **so many years,** every second of every day, fighting off the OCD and trying to find help for it. And this past August twisted it all and made it even worse than it already was. So I somehow push through each day despite the horrid shit the disorder puts me through constantly.

How could I not be angry? 

Something I've often said lately is that I wish the disorder were a physical thing in front of me, so I could rip into it. The only thing that makes it more frustrating than it already is is the fact that with all the anger I have, my anger can't do anything to it. Makes me think of Joker in The Dark Knight. ""You have nothing to threaten me with. Nothing to do with all your strength."" Definitely sounds like something my disorder would say.

I'm beyond angry at living every day with this. 

I'm beyond angry at the content of the OCD's current repertoire and the fact that I have to have it in my mind *all the fucking time* on some level, when the mere thought of it to a normal person would be enough to make them sick. 

I'm beyond angry at the world, at medical care being closed off to people who can't afford it, at everything the guy in Russia is doing to the Ukraine (especially the horrid shit I learned about earlier today), at everything I went through due to toxic religion and *all it took away from me,* at how badly I want some things in this life that I know I'll never get because of how much the disorder has fucked me up, **I am very, very angry.**

I wish I had a heavy bag to beat the hell out of every day, but I live in a tiny apartment which isn't the place to set up a heavy bag. Plus the tiny apartment comes with its own set of things that piss me off. 

Why am I not an angrier person? I haven't the slightest fucking idea.

As per that last post, maybe I somehow get some of it out when I imagine myself beating the hell out of metaphorical representations of my disorder in my mind.

But whether or not that's the case, I need something better.

Do I need to vent it out? Do I need to go find a gym with a heavy bag that I can go to every single day to release all this incredible, frustrated anger?

Or do I need to meditate or do yoga and use more subdued techniques to vent off all the rage? 

Or is rage and anger not something that builds up over time? 

I dunno. I dunno anything about this.

twd30m,"How have you spoken to/'explained'/talked about your OCD to your employer? Hi everyone!

I've been diagnosed with OCD (and also anxiety and depression, with an episode of psychotic depression) since 2017.  I've been in different kinds of therapy and I have been taking fluoxetine since 2018, which has been a literal lifesaver in managing my symptoms.  The pandemic has obviously caused a lot of shift in my coping mechanisms as I know it has for a lot of us, and has caused me to relapse into higher levels of some of my OCD behaviours.  My diagnosis is the 'pure' type of OCD, so my compulsions are minimal and mainly to do with mentally checking and safety checking.  The main manifestation of my OCD symptoms has always been intrusive thoughts, often of harming myself and others and fearing losing control, and circular/obsessive rumination that is debilitating to the point of not being able to interact with others in certain social environments.

I started a new job in October 2021, which was home based at the time.  To keep a long and convoluted story short, I've found that home working has dramatically eased some of my symptoms, particularly to do with concentration and focus, and controlling outside distractions and aggressors.  It has been hands down the only positive of this shitty pandemic, and I've found it has made a ridiculous positive change in my ability to work comfortably.  I'm currently in the process of putting in a flexible working request to continue to home work, but predominantly my focus is on not working from the office due to distractions and a lack of break out/quiet spaces.  I also had a period of agoraphobia that lasted for around one year before/during initial diagnosis, which was triggered by being/feeling stuck and contained.  

One problem I'm having is that my direct manager has asked, now on a number of occasions, to 'understand' how exactly my OCD is impacting my inability to return to the office even once a week.  I've explained my symptoms and concerns as clearly but non-intrusively as possible, as I get that she needs to have an idea so my request can be properly looked into, but it's just...not comfortable having to disclose the intricacies of my mental health?  She's prodded quite a lot and I'm finding it really difficult to put in writing or words outside of 'I don't feel ok being in that environment as my symptoms are triggered by confined, loud, uncontrollable spaces, leading to debilitating intrusive thoughts and the inability to focus'.  I feel like because I'm not outlining every. single. symptom I've had in great detail, she's being purposefully obtuse about it.  I've written a formal request where I've outlined, as suggested by ACAS, an employment support service, the reasons, and I just feel a bit defeated, singled out, and uncomfortable being put in the position of being asked to talk about this so specifically.  Has anyone experienced this sort of thing before, and had any luck with discussing it without feeling like your whole medical history is being held up to the light?!  I'm at the point where I'm really frustrated at having to pretty much explain what OCD is over and over, and feel like I want to be petty and obtuse back and send a link to some daft simplistic factsheet next time she asks.",4,4,2022-04-04 17:06:28-04:00,spoken toexplainedtalk ocd employ hi everyon ive diagnos ocd also anxieti depress episod psychot depress sinc ive differ kind therapi take fluoxetin sinc liter lifesav manag symptom pandem obvious caus lot shift cope mechan know lot us caus relaps high level ocd behaviour diagnosi pure type ocd compuls minim mainli mental check safeti check main manifest ocd symptom alway intrus thought often harm other fear lose control circularobsess rumin debilit point abl interact other certain social environ start new job octob home base time keep long convolut stori short ive found home work dramat eas symptom particularli concentr focu control outsid distract aggressor hand posit shitti pandem ive found made ridicul posit chang abil work comfort im current process put flexibl work request continu home work predominantli focu work offic due distract lack break outquiet space also period agoraphobia last around one year beforedur initi diagnosi trigger beingfeel stuck contain one problem im direct manag ask number occas understand exactli ocd impact inabl return offic even week ive explain symptom concern clearli nonintrus possibl get need idea request properli look justnot comfort disclos intricaci mental health she prod quit lot im find realli difficult put write word outsid dont feel ok environ symptom trigger confin loud uncontrol space lead debilit intrus thought inabl focu feel like im outlin everi singl symptom ive great detail she purpos obtus ive written formal request ive outlin suggest aca employ support servic reason feel bit defeat singl uncomfort put posit ask talk specif anyon experienc sort thing luck discuss without feel like whole medic histori held light im point im realli frustrat pretti much explain ocd feel like want petti obtus back send link daft simplist factsheet next time ask,"Sentiment(polarity=0.05888672438672438, subjectivity=0.41247691197691194)",0.05888672438672438,positive

twh7f9,"Am I being unreasonable for refusing treatment? (Skip to tele if you can‚Äôt read the whole thing) Okay, so to make a long story short. I struggle with quite a few physical and mental health issues, to which I have yet to really find a perfect formula for treating them. I‚Äôve been diagnosed with adhd, anxiety, and major depressive disorder, although I think my real diagnosis might be autism and some form of OCD, since the bulk of my depression + anxiety stem from intrusive thought(s). My mental health is still kind of a mystery to me after 24 years of being alive and over a decades worth of therapy. 

I also have suffered from quite a few digestive illnesses (IBS, gerd, reflux, gastritis). All of which failed to respond to diet changes. IBS and reflux thrive off stress. The only way for me seems to be through prescriptions. A few years ago, I tried taking abilify 10mg to which I continued taking for over a year. Then in early 2019, I stopped. I didn‚Äôt like how I was constantly tired. All of the medication I had taken made me insanely tired. 

The #1 factor as to why I‚Äôm refusing to take medication right now is because I also gained a lot of weight from it. I hated taking pictures because I was so chubby. I gained 20lbs in one year which is a big jump for me. It‚Äôs a shame really because my whole body felt great. My digestive symptoms got better, my depression got better, my whole life felt like a better version of itself.  But I do not want to gain weight. 

Am I unreasonable for refusing medication because of this? I felt great but I hated my body. I also want to work in entertainment and let be real, there aren‚Äôt many people allowed to be fat in entertainment. I‚Äôm afraid my life might be doomed if I do not get it together soon.

Tldr - Abilify 10mg improves my patterns of thinking immensely but Im really afraid of gaining weight so I don‚Äôt want to go back to it. I gained 20lbs in one year despite no huge diet changes.

twgam2,"Scared that coincidences mean something. Okay so I have had OCD since I was 5 or 6. Long story of childhood abuse, that part is not interesting but as a result I always relied on my OCD to reassure me that everything would be okay. 

  I am currently 21 weeks pregnant and have a new fear of dying during childbirth. 

  My OCD will convince me that things are signs. Like a certain song about death playing. I pressed my shuffle five different times earlier on Apple Music and my brain said ‚Äúif this plays a song related to death you will die during childbirth‚Äù Well it played a song called ‚Äú don‚Äôt fear the reaper‚Äù so I pressed shuffle again and my brain said the same thing and then it played ‚Äúthis could be heartbreak‚Äù by the amity affliction. So my brain told me to do it three more times. The next three songs did not relate to death but the first two relating to death basically convinced me I was going to die. I tried to ignore that panic for as long as a I could but I feel like there continues to be signs/coincidences.

twfww0,"Spoke with my psychiatrist he said I need to close my brain with Abilify Had OCD my whole life. Started with thrichotilomania, contamination, and then gradually the worst phase so called pureo, I like to call it advanced OCD. Never bothered me actually until pureO kicked in.   
I don't know where to start. Maybe from f\*\*\* you father for tricking my mother into marriage and passing on this disease or f\*\*\* you both parents for not having knowledge about mental health issues. I was on some strong weed for 9 months daily and according to my psychiatrist I opened up my vulnerable brain which resulted with severe OCD.  
This pureO is devastating, I hear my own thoughts and have constant ear-worms. Hearing your own thoughts/internal monologue can be frightening it's like having schizophrenia but you are still totally sane.

I don't know why but am still avoiding meds, I cannot accept the fact that this torture happened to me perfectly healthy guy who handled everything in life and was highly successful.

twf56e,"I have a lot of doubts(ocd?) about myself, my sexuality, even maybe gender. Help me, pls. I think this subreddit is good for telling about myself and asking what to do next. My story in few words:

It all started with HOCD. I found a picture of feminine guy and started to doubt my sexuality. Like all other HOCD people i did a lot of checking to prove i am not gay, or opposite - trying to maje my body admit that I am gay. After some time i managed to live with this hocd, ignore thoughts and so on, but when i was doing another testing an porn i found sissy hypno vids. At first all this idea of forsed femenisation was arousing. Of course this wasn't a pleasant arousal, because i still had hocd. And i never masturbated to sissy content. 

I was afraid of my interest in sissy topics and started to look for information about this fetish. I found a thing called AGP. It was something that could answer my questions. Well, in childhood i had fantasies of becoming a girl, and later had this fantasies with sex context. But i cant say that i am 100% AGP, because, for example, usually i dont get aroused by fantasies of me inside female body having sex. Even if i try, I ""swap"" positions with male in this fantasies and it turns into normal hetero fantasy.

But anyway, this situation with AGP of course didn't make me happy or calm. Even worse. Before i thought that i am straight with ocd, but started to think that i am cursed with AGP, which really can ruin my life, and really turn me gay, or making to want do gay things.

I have read tons of posts on reddit, forums in internet. I didnt find answer.

That painful mix of problems still hurts me every day. Today i had a gay dream and woke up aroused, but sad and angry. Then for the first half of day i was distresed. Then i just forsed myself to fantasy about girls, i got arousal and calmed a bit.

twk0u8,"OCD + ADHD (+ cPTSD ? + Autism ?)   

I'm a woman in my late 20s in law school (decently intelligent, which enabled me to score high on the LSAT to get into a top law school, but I have a long history of mediocre academic performance; got really depressed/suicidal in college, and so dropped out several times before graduating college). 

I have a blend of perfectionist OCD and ADHD, probably along with cPTSD, and maybe autism, but it's hard to pin it all down, and I'm looking for any sort of advice/feedback from people who may relate in some way to what I'm describing, or have some new insight into what my problems might be. Sorry for being a bit rambling/disorganized in my descriptions, and for the weird formatting issue with extra spacing between words. Feel free to ask any clarification questions :)

&#x200B;

* I'm about to graduate law school, and I'm just barely inching buy (my GPA is  technically passing, but just barely; I'm ranked at the bottom of my class). I would say      I'm perfectionist OCD in that I am constantly worried about doing things      the ""right way"" when it comes to academic and social      performance, and very hard on myself for my perceived screw ups, but      there's def a lot disorganization there, where my obsessive thoughts don't      consistently drive me to a certain set of behaviors/rituals/compulsions.      I'm constantly criticizing myself for my poor performance in law school in      a way that seems obsessive, but this obsessive concern doesn't drive me to      perform, e.g., to frantically study for hours every day to try to avoid      failing. I get that drive sometimes, where maybe one day a week I'll sit      down and genuinely try to do my assigned reading for the day, and while      attempting to do that task, obsessive ""fear of failure"" type      feelings (specifically, ""fear that I'm not smart enough to understand      the material, fear that I don't see the big picture"") cloud my ability      to focus and really engage with the material, and I end up getting about      3/4 of the way through the assignment, taking too many notes and      self-sabotagingly yes missing the big picture (not really remembering      anything about what I read). But then after that I feel increasingly hard      on myself for ""doing the work but not actually understanding it""      and I feel disappointed/impatient that I spent so much time doing the work      without being able to calm down and actually engage with the material. So      then I go several days just avoiding doing my school work (in part for      ADHD reasons too, explained below), and feeling a lot of self-doubt, and      beating myself up, and across the course of the semester, doing less and      less schoolwork, and ending up with bad grades
* A big      my portion of ""obsessions"" aren't forward thinking, aren't about      the future possibility of failure, but are retrospective--obsessively      replaying a moment of past perceived failure over and over again in my      head; could be a moment that happened five minutes ago, or sometimes some      random stimulus I encounter in the present moment will randomly trigger a      memory from a perceived failure that happened five years ago, ten years      ago, and the memory just seems so intrusive and traumatizing, like my mind      insists on bombarding me with old memories of unpleasant times over and      over--magnifying a small moment into a major trauma‚Ä¶and so for a big part      of my days, my head is filled with thoughts and feelings related to both:      fear of future failure, and all the ways (I perceive that) I have already      failed. cPTSD seems to be part of the picture, given how I magnify and      linger over the pain of past experiences, and also my childhood      environment. My mother was probably emotionally abusive, although not      a clear cut case (she gave me a lot      of mixed signals, telling me how smart and pretty I was, but then also      being very critical of me: ""you should be making all As! Lazy!""      ""your shirt looks wrinkled"" ""that mole on your nose is      weird""), and I feel a sense of traumatic wound from my experience in      school at 10 years old when all the other girls in my class ""broke up      with me"" (as a friend) for being socially awkward 
* ADHD      is certainly part of the picture too. Aside from the OCD-type reasons why      it's difficult for me to concentrate on schoolwork (constant intrusive      thoughts/worry about failure), there's also a      ""boredom""/pleasure-seeking aspect. Reading a law textbook--even      at a time when I'm relatively calm and not too worried about failure--just      feels dull, not pleasurable. There's plenty of other things I'd rather be      doing. And often I impulsively make an irresponsible/self-destructive      choice in the moment, like getting drunk, and ignoring the consequences of      tomorrow (even though I do indeed know what the consequences are, and that      they are unhelpful) 
* Autism      may be in the mix‚Ä¶for as long as I can remember I've just had a really      tough time regulating my emotions, and there's always been some sort of      major gaps in my executive functioning, and it could be that all the      mental health practitioners I've seen up until now have misdiagnosed it      because I'm a woman. From I very      early age I took very seriously (and yes obsessed) over my mother's      prescriptions and criticisms about how it's important for me to fit      in/have friends/act normal, etc., and so I think I may have developed some      pretty hardcore masking tendencies early on. At school, I was always a      sweet shy girl, but then when I came home I had meltdowns over really      small random things (like temper tantrums, screaming fits even in my teens      about little frustrations such as running out of ice cream). I don't      exhibit the hyper-stereotypical autistic fixation with numbers/math, but      there's some level of detail attention that may be unusual (I tend to      notice clothes a lot, and have a pretty good memory for dates-- I can go      through my closet and pretty easily remember the Month/Year, Store, and      City that I bought each garment in). 
   * I       definitely don't obsessively rely on a routine though, the way people       with autism are said to do. My only routine is that I have no routine: I       get up and go to bed at different times every day, do different amounts       of work for school each week, workout randomly and occasionally. It‚Äôs all       disorganized, with an undertone of nihilism (""I'm never gonna get       better anyway so why bother consistently trying?"")
   * From       pretty early on, I was taught to view social anxiety in terms of       ""self-esteem""/""insecurity"" issues, and so that's the       lens I always applied to my own social anxiety. It feels really tricky to       take off that lens now, and think of my social anxiety in terms of the       autism ""overstimulation"" lens, that there's too much noise, or       too much bright light, etc. There is an issue with hyperempathy going on       though, where when I'm around other people I'm very very sensitive to       their facial expressions and perceived reactions to me (subconsciously       looking for cues of acceptance, rejection), and so the moment I perceive       even micro-disapproval from another (a less than cheerful       ""hello"" back), it triggers feelings strong of anxiety, in a       sort of negative feed back loop where because I feel socially rejected,       the feelings of rejection make me act more nervous, more awkward (more in       ways that, I figure, aren't socially desirable). In some ways, I have       very strong emotional and cognitive empathy; I can really understand and       relate to other people's feelings either in a direct ""I       (emotionally) know the feeling"" kind of a way or a ""ah I       haven't really experienced that but I can connect the dots, and       understand how/why that person in that situation would feel that way.""       But I tend to often be a little clueless in the moment (making an       off-putting dirty joke, or expressing a polarizing opinion, with a group       of people I just met; ). I definitely have trouble with volume control       (sometimes speaking to quietly, other times, too loud) and conversation       pacing (interrupting other people), but that may just be ADHD and       anxiety. 
* I've      considered BPD too, due to the emotional dysregulation thing, but I feel      like it's a mismatch. My interpersonal relationships (with romantic partners      and friends) tend to be fairly stable (I fear rejection a bit, but not      abandonment); I'm very forgiving of others, and not one to lash out or      really get mad at others. I sometimes tend to idolize others for their      intellectual/social skills but it isn't accompanied by a phase of      devaluing them (rather, I simultaneously idolize them and devalue myself      for being so much ""lesser than"" them, and as time goes on, even      as I may get to know such a person better, see that they have some      relatable flaws, I continue to have high regard for them). 

&#x200B;

* Medication wise, I've alternated between different combinations of an SSRI (fluoxetine, escitalopram,      sertraline) for anxiety/depression + a stimulant-type medication (Vyvanse,      Adderall, Dextroamphetamine, Wellbutrin) for ADHD over the years, each with side effects      that seem to exacerbate my comorbidities:
   * All       SSRIs make me sleepy/sedated, preventing me from feeling a baseline level       of awareness long enough to make it through a full school or study day       (like just a reasonable 8 hours, not too crazy like 12 hours). 
   * Stimulant/stimulant-type       medications
      * Vyvanse        makes my anxiety really bad in terms of mood/emotion (as opposed to        cognitively); it doesn't seem to trigger obsessive thoughts more than        normal, but it gives me just this very strong feeling of        dread/apprehension/guilt, so that I feel especially uncomfortable        interacting in social situations, and as a result makes me feel mildly        miserable on a day-to-day basis 
      * Dextroamphetamine        SR gives me similar ""emotional anxiety"" problems, which makes        sense given that it is molecular similar to Vyvanse
      * adderall def makes my OCD worse in some        way; gives me a figurative type of tunnel vision (my actual vision isn't        narrowed) where I spend excessively long periods of time perfecting        minute aspects of a task (e.g., in trying to write a paper, spending 40        minutes editing the same sentence over and over again), totally losing        sight of the overall goal of completing the task, without necessarily        being actively bombarded with/aware of the thoughts/fears of failure the        way I otherwise might me when trying to do school work. 
      * Wellbutrin causes some emotional        anxiety, though less than Vyvanse/dexedrine do, but it gives me this        really bad tremor that have causes friends/colleagues to be visibly        concerned for me (""Are you okay? You're shaking a lot right        now"") so that has a secondary effect on increasing my social        anxiety (""oh no, people must see me shaking right now; they must        think I'm nervous and weird"")
   * I've   had several years of psychotherapy/talk therapy with different therapists       who all practiced some blend of CBT, DBT, and Psychoanalysis (have not       had ERT yet, which may be the key to helping with OCD). I think my       experiences with therapy overall have been very harmful for my OCD. It's given       me the language/label to obsessively notice and analyze my thoughts and       behaviors, without any real sense of how to change.",4,1,2022-04-04 22:08:59-04:00,ocd adhd cptsd autism

twapa6,"How To Stop Believing Lies Recently just came to understand what OCD truly is, the different kinds, and more and so much of my entire life makes sense. I have definitely had a couple of different kinds since childhood and instead of feeling ""crazy"", for once, I feel understood. That being said, I am now working on how to cope with OCD after years and years of it. I'm kind of stuck on where to start...

The intrusive thoughts I've had for almost four years now are pretty much a play on insecurities created from my responses to the thoughts that pop up in my mind on a loop all day and all night. For example, ""You're not good enough."" ""Your spouse deserves better than you."" ""You're an awful mom because of x/y/z"" ""Everyone laughs at you and doesn't take you seriously."" etc. I have heard these thoughts so much on a loop in my mind for years now that I honestly have started to believe some of them. I will say I have certain situations and past trauma in my life that trigger these thoughts and unfortunately can't get rid of the people or situations that do. However, I'm wondering if others struggle similarly and how do they cope with the lies/narratives created in response to your thoughts. 

I have read that responding isn't beneficial as it just continues the cycle of ""responding"" but I was wondering if positive affirmations would help?! I'm kind of lost and unfortunately, therapy is off the table for me until I move and get settled in.

twit4l,"Is my OCD bad? So I got diagnosed with PANDAS back when I was around 7 because I had a lot of ticks and behavioral issues. I‚Äôm a male btw

Fast forward to now and I‚Äôm 18 in college and i‚Äôve been suffering with OCD and some remaining ticks connected to my OCD.

I live a very social life but my obsessive thoughts take over 24/7. Im constantly obsessed with my hair and outfits and I want to make sure it looks good before I go out. I feel like recording the dates of all my haircuts so I know when the perfect time and length is so I can coordinate my future haircuts with. 

Another major issue I have is thoughts. I constantly worry about my family and have these daily routines of shaking my head and clearing my mind completely every time I think a bad thought and if i don‚Äôt do this, it‚Äôll happen. 

I worry so much about my family and making sure everyone is safe and happy that I want to constantly come home and be with them regardless of my classes. My grades are declining and I‚Äôve accepted that i‚Äôm gonna fail 2 of my classes so Im not even trying anymore in them. 

I have these constant ticks where I force pressure out of my stomach really hard and I do it so much to the point i‚Äôve tuned it out.

Another issue I have is isolating myself because I feel like I look like shit and can never comfortably be in public without constantly worrying about my appearance/ the way i‚Äôm standing or what i‚Äôm wearing. I switch my outfits so many times during the day.

twcmsm,"Really inappropriate intrusive thoughts  This happens most of the time when I'm hanging out with friends. Being around friends so often just triggers an onslaught of thoughts about doing sexually inappropriate, violent things and insulting people. It makes it harder to enjoy being social. It makes me feel like a terrible person, makes me question my sexuality, and makes me worry about losing control of myself. I know that these thoughts are manifestations of things I don't want to do, and thus aren't \*really\* indicative of my morals, but on some level I still feel like they are. I don't trust myself not to do those things. I know that everybody has intrusive thoughts to some degree, and I try to just brush them off, but they just keep coming. I know focusing on them too much feeds into them, so I try not to be bothered by them, but I'm still distressed about them anyway. 

  I had overt compulsions as a young child and they shifted to covert obsessions and compulsions, and as much as I'd like to think that I ""overcame"" OCD, in certain situations it is painfully obvious that I still think in similar patterns even as an adult. My parents didn't get me help. My mom claimed it gets better with age. I just don't think she takes mental health very seriously.

twf6qs,"if I believe/feel my negative thought, then this attaches the word 'because' to my negative behavior If we feel pressured, we trigger our OCD negative behavior. So we feel 'bothered' by our behavior. Thoughts/behaviors on itself don't cause 'feeling bothered', it's the way we look at them 'that makes our negative behavior bother us'. So the only way we perceive pressure, is if we form an 'opinion' about it.

Solution: what I have tried, is:

If I don't TRY to reach a positive behavior, then my goal is not success and then even if I fail, I should not feel emotions like feeling terrible about failing.

&#x200B;

Result:

Unfortunately, I still feel bothered when I fail. I recognize that it's because I still want a positive behavior, even only a little bit.

tvrch4,"It is possible, whether you like it or not. December, I was on the watch in a hospital, terrorized by my brain every second of every day. I had no hope, no passion to live. But, I wasn't quite sewercycle just yet. Hanging on by my last thread of hope to keep pushing to see clearer days ahead. No, not quite there yet. Simply put, I wasn't living. Eating, drinking, sleeping, hygiene, relationships, work, school, anything and everything in life stopped. They didn't exist. It was a perpetual state of torture that only I knew, and no one believed. Yet, here I still stand. Here, I push with every ounce of will inside of this meat sack, fighting with every cell of my being to keep living. I can actually wake up and not instantly go into panic mode (sometimes.) I can to work and actually be a part of society. I can actually live again. It's bitter-sweetasfuck, knowing that it can come back at any moment, but I've gotten better about enjoying the time when my symptoms aren't as crushing, instead of sitting in paralyzing fear of when it will return. I've learned to believe that it can get better even when it does indeed get so much worse. It's liberating.

I am currently diagnosed with ocd, adhd, c-ptsd, bi-polar,  and my therapist and I are fighting for an autism diagnoses as well. (Autism was my big life altering moment. It allowed me to actually observe me, for me, instead of this person I have been for the last 19 years. I was able to identify stressors, my weaknesses, my strengths, what I actually LIKE!!!  I was able to actually identify what moments were probably traumatic in my life (just getting started on this, there's a lot of luggage to dig through), and even begin to cope. But, this is another disorganized rant meat for another sub.)

Everybody will have that moment in your lives. Where something just clicks like that final, crucial piece to a puzzle, a puzzle with a riddle containing the answer/reason/purpose that we all desperately seek. Note that finally fitting that last puzzle piece in place is not the endgame. Now, it's time for you to work out that riddle. A riddle that could take anywhere from a few weeks to many, many years to answer. And while that may sound impossibly intimidating, you will experience unimaginable progress towards the life you really want. Even (ESPECIALLY!!!) if you don't even notice. There will be check points, but there will also be lapses.  However, they can feel devastating, an insult insult all the work you have built up. But please, PLEASE know that it is not over. You have not lost your progress you have fought so desperately hard for. While it may seem like you have fallen all the way back down the pit you fought so hard to climb out of, you merely tripped into a hole in to the street. I know that you can pull yourself out of this one.

While I may be venting a bit in this post, it is my intention to spread some insight that maybe, just maybe, our existence may not be perpetual agony after all. Even for us, the unseen tragedies we face, the absolute amount unaware trauma that we are drowned by daily. You are valid. You are a person who has seen and heard and felt incomprehensible things, and yet here you still stand. Here, you refuse to give up amid the face of pure torture. Here, you bear an impossible weight, and somehow manage to keep your stride up. I believe in you. I am proud of you.

I don't really do much to manage it as of right now.

I feel so horrible for her because she can‚Äôt stop and she constantly has to have bandaids on her fingers because of it. She‚Äôs tried that stuff that tastes bad when you bite it to try to break the habit and also has an anxiety ring but because her thumb is always bandaged she can‚Äôt pick the ring properly and it hurts to bend it.

tw7deb,"astrology and OCD? I know way too much about astrology and am obsessed with reading and interpreting my chart - especially looking at transits on certain days. This isn‚Äôt just horoscopes and basic stuff either: my family has studied an ancient and well-respected form of Persian astrology for generations. We celebrate zoroastrian traditions that have to do with the location of the planets and have rituals that go along with them - this is deeply ingrained into my culture and background. 

I am so scared looking at transits for certain days some times. If there is a big important day I will obsessively look at the transit of planets in my chart and try to predict what will happen. It does not help that I (or other family who help interpret) have been right maybe half the time. The thing is everything usually always unfolds and makes sense in the way my chart says, but the actual way I predicted it would happen was wrong. 

A recent example of this issue is when I was having these intense ‚Äòsuperstitions‚Äô around my relationship and believing that every time I got him a gift or prepared something for him in anticipation to see him - it wouldn‚Äôt work out. I‚Äôve always had this superstition with the boys i‚Äôve dated in the past. If I bought something to prepare for the date or meet up (whether it be buying condoms for a hook up or getting a birthday gift for my long term boyfriend) it would ALWAYS end up not happening or we would break up. 

I have an enormous fear of this happening with my current boyfriend on our one year anniversary coming up. The last person I was with that I dated this long we lasted until literally 3 weeks before our one year. I have about one more month until this with my current bf (we have been dating for more than a year already though - this is just a year from when he asked me to officially be his girlfriend) but I am so so so afraid something is going to happen, I‚Äôm literally walking on egg shells. I feel like I can‚Äôt be too happy or
get to excited or else we will break up. I am putting an enormous amount of effort into the anniversary gift i‚Äôm making for him and every time I add to it I get more and more afraid that it‚Äôs going to end and the more I work on it and dedicate time/money, the more likely it is we‚Äôre going to break up. 

So back to astrology, I looked up the transit for the day of our anniversary and have been so insanely anxious about what it looks like. It says NOTHING about relationships and everything is focused on ‚Äúself love, self growth, throwing yourself into work, friendships, and hobbies.‚Äù I‚Äôm sorry but that sounds like a break up to me?? I literally sat there in fear and shock as I contemplated the situation and I‚Äôm so scared to do or say anything! 

I don‚Äôt feel like anything‚Äôs wrong with our relationship either, we love each other and fight sometimes but get over it fairly quickly. However I feel like my superstition is when I feel like everything‚Äôs good and I‚Äôm super comfortable, happy, and invested - the rug gets pulled out from under me and I‚Äôm blindsided.

I‚Äôm just very scared

edit: please no judgment over the astrology I practice.

twcusd,"Obsessive thinking causing childhood trauma? (TW: SA) I vaguely remember being babysat by my grandma when I was 5 and asking her about crimes. My parents told me I was too young to know about them, but I insisted to my grandmother that I am smart and want to understand crimes so I can avoid them and protect myself and others. She hesitated but then explained to me what kidnapping, pedophilia and rape are. I asked her how I can prevent these things and she said, sadly I can't because I am still a small child, and they are an adult. After that I must have went into psychosis because I could not comprehend such scariness, and I was determined to protect myself and my baby brother from pedophiles, burglars and rapists. What happened next is I have graphic memories of getting kidnapped, being beaten, assaulted, sold to 5+ men, being forced to do bestiality, attempted murders, starvation, and psychological torture. I don't know how at my age such imagination can be so visual and realistic, but it's possible because I was good at drawing and making up stories before that. I believed that I went blind after that, because the kidnapper told me they would kill me if I looked. I would keep my eyes shut for years, and have paranoid hallucinations of beatings and bullying. Later on I actually showed symptoms of abuse. My parents sent me to psychologists, put me on medications, and told me we won't meet grandma anymore because she is clinically insane. I had PTSD flashbacks and paranoid delusions about my classmates and teachers and parents. Yet, I was a perfectionist with good grades and big ambition.

twc6fd,"MY CLONAZEPAM STORY + AN IMPORTANT QUESTION FOR ANY OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE ALSO TAKING THE MEDICATION üíä Hi all, when first diagnosed about 10 years ago I was put on diazepam. Over a couple of years i went from 2mg a day to 10 mg a day because my body adjusted so quickly and the doseage just did nothing to help me anymore. 

Even before I first started diazepam, my anxiety due to my ocd was so bad that I would be visible shaking in front of people or on my own, so I knew I needed to be on SOMETHING to help me....but as I said above, my body adjusted so quickly to the dosage that my Dr just kept increasing it more and more.

Then I started to see other drs who made me feel like a ""drug addict"" when I told them what dose I was on, and the fear I developed of being tarred by this brush became just as painful as my original anxiety, and I felt so bloody judged.

The only problem that I personally felt on diazepam was when I forgot to take a tablet, so as long as I maintained my dose, whilst it didn't really help my anxiety, it also kept me stable to the dose that my body was used to...and like I said, the new huge issue that I faced after being on the diazepam for approx 7 years and then seeing new drs, was the unbelievable SHAME they made me feel, when I had only ever followed drs orders the whole time.

- This is where clonazepam entered the picture:

After I returned to Australia from living in england, I saw  a new psychiatrist and he said ""I can get you FULLY off (10 mg p/d) diazepam within 2 days"". 

Nb. I want to make it clear that EVERYONE IS DUFFERENT and even though 10mg per day sounds like a lot/is a lot, I have always had the ""skin of a rhinoceros"" and never once did I appear ""dopey or druggy or slow"" etc whilst on this dose.

Anyway I was so BLOODY SICK of constantly being treated like ""I WAS"" a drug addiction on that 10mg dosage that when I saw that new psychiatrist, I just ""gave in"" out of pure frustration and agreed to switch meds to clonazepam in what sounded like a crazily radically plan to get me off diazepam.

The PLAN by this psychiatrist would be that I would be on a very high dose of clonazepam FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME to initially get me off the 10mg, and THEN HE would when me off the Clonazepam over the course of approx 6 or 8 weeks.

NB. this was approx 3 years ago

HOWEVER, things did AND didn't go as planned:

1. Yes, I Went ""cold Turkey"" and I stopped taking the diazepam completely WHILE he replaced it with the high dose of Clonazepam and three were no withdrawal side effects of coming of the diazepam, and after 2 days I never took it again.

2. The psychiatrist PROMISED a VERY strict and CAREFULLY overseen withdrawal plan for the Clonazepam (from memory, he had shifted me to 14mg of Clonazepam p/d), which was to last approx 6 to 8 weeks.

BUT THE PSYCHIATRIST PROVED TO BE HOPELESS:

He didn't use a computer and would only ever scratch out notes of what he had said during our sessions on a scrap of paper, AND EVERY FOLLOWING SESSION he would start by saying to to ""UM WHAT DID WE SAY IS OUR LAST APPOINTMENT? WHAT DOSEAGE OF CLONAZEPAM DID I SAY YOU ARE MEANT TO BE ON NOW??""

- to say I was FURIOUS at how unprofessional this was, is the biggest UNDERSTATEMENT of all time. 

* SO this psychiatrists ""plan"" for a ""VERY strict and CAREFULLY overseen withdrawal of the Clonazepam"" was a total JOKE...and as the weeks went on he didn't change from his routine of ASKING ME!! WHAT DOSE I WAS ON, AND CRUCIALLY: HE NEVER ONCE STARTED TO DROP MY CLONAZEPAM DOSEAGE.

* SO after 6 weeks of pleading with him to get a proper structure together, I finally decided to get rid of him and find a new psychiatrist...

(NOTE!! THERE IS A MAJOR TRIGGER WARNING BELOW, SO IF YOU FEEL VULNERABLE, PLEASE SCROLL QUICKLY ALL THE WAY DOWN THE PAGE FROM WHEN YOU FIRST SEE THE ‚ö†Ô∏è SYMBOL UNTIL YOU PASS THE NEXT ‚ö†Ô∏è SYMBOL)

- But this turned out to be a horrible idea as anyone I rang want to put me in an INPATIENT DETOX CENTRE which I KNEW was going to bring my OCD to a boil because I was told I would be (TRIGGER WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è)

this was around the start of coved and that is why only ""free public"" detox places had availability as private centres had closed there doors.

BUT ASIDE FROM THIS, IT WAS A ""NO BRAINER"" FOR ME TO IMMEDIATELY REALISE WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN TO MY OCD IF I ENTERED A CENTRE WITH OTHER PEOPLE WHO WERE IN THE SITUATION THAT I DESCRIBED ABOVE IN THE TRIGGER WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è  PARAGRAPH.

SO the end result has been that over the past approx 3 years, I have SELF WITHDRAWN from home and have managed to reduce my Clonazepam from the dose the psychiatrist left me on (14mg p/d) to my current doseage of 8mg p/d.

* When I have tried to go lower than 8mg p/d, I have encountered withdrawal side effects, which are simply not compatible to endure with the GIGANTIC stress I am under if you read my other posts, plus if I was to self withdraw and go through the hell of that, I know I would need to be in a state of my life where I had NO OTHER DISTRACTIONS - WHICH IS PURELY IMPOSSIBLE AS IM STRUGGLING TO HOLD ON AS IT IS.

1. THIS WHOLE MESS HAS LEFT ME IN AN EVEN TOUGHER PLACE FOR THE PAST 3 YEARS AS ITS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND A PSYCHIATRIST WHO WILL AGREE TO PRESCRIBE 8mg p/d ON A LONG TERM BASIS

2. IF I **WASN'T** TAKING 8MG P/D, THERE IS SIMPLY NO POSSIBLE WAY I COULD GET THROUGH EACH DAY, AS WHEN I WAKE UP EACH DAY, I AM ALREADY SUFFERING FROM WITHDRAWALS OF (IN MY CASE) THE MEDICATION WEARING OFF, AND I NEED TO TAKE MY MORNING DOSE OF 4MG OTHERWISE I CAN'T EVEN PUSH THROUGH MY NORMAL STRESS OF EACH DAY.

3. I HAD A PHONE CONSULTATION MY MY DR WHO PRECRIBES MY CLONAZEPAM YESTERDAY, AND I TOLD HIM ABOUT SIDE EFFECTS OF MY FAILED BRAIN SURGERY WHICH HAVE EXISTED FOR 5 YEARS, BUT HAVE DRAMATICALLY INCREASED IN SERIOUSNESS OVER THE PAST 6-8 WEEKS.

4. THE MAIN WORSENING SIDE EFFECT THAT I TOLD MY DR ABOUT, IS ONE THAT BEGAN 5 YEARS AGO AFTER MY BRAIN SURGERY - NB. (PLEASE READ MY OTHER POSTS FOR INFO ABOUT THAT)...ANYWAY THIS SIDE EFFECT IS ONE WHEREBY I ""SUDDENLY BLACKOUT"" WITH NO NOTICE AND THE ""COME TO"" ANY WHERE BETWEEN 30 MINS TO 8 HOURS LATER. HOWEVER OVER THE PAST 5 YEARS, THIS SIDE EFFECT HAS ALWAYS CORREALATED WITH ME HAVING ENDURED **MAJOR, MAJOR STRESS** FOR THE FEW HOURS PRECEDING THE ""BLACKOUT"" EACH TIME...

5. NOW THOUGH, THIS SIDE EFFECT OF MY BRAIN SURGERY HAS DRASTICALLY WORSENED - (AN EXAMPLE IS BELOW):

- LAST THURSDAY I HAD SLEPT ""SUFFICIENTLY WELL"" THE NIGHT BEFORE, MY FATUGUE WAS AT ITS NOTMAL LEVEL AND THERE HAD BEEN NO UNUSUAL OR EXTRA STRESS EXPERIENCED THAT DAY. AT 3:00PM MY SUPPORT WORKED DROVE ME THE 15 MINUTE CAR TRIP THAT IT TAKES TO GET TO AN APPOINTMENT THAT I HAD WITH A PODIATRIST. I COMMENCED MY 30 MINUTE APPOINTMENT AT 3:30PM AND WAS BACK IN THE CAR BEING DRIVEN BACK HOME AT 4PM. HOWEVER MY SUPPORT WORKER REVEALED TO ME THAT 3 MINUTES INTO THE DRIVE BACK HOME, I HAD SLUMPED FORWARD AND ""BLACKED OUT""...AND FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS, HE WAS UNABLE TO WAKE ME DESPITE SCREAMING AND SHAKING ME..
INSTEAD I ""NATURALLY CAME TO"" 3 AND A 1/2 HOURS LATER, AFTER HE HAD PULLED THE CAR UP BACK AT MY HOUSE"".

6. SO I TOLD THE DR WHO HAS BEEN PRESCBINING MY CLONAZEPAM OVER THE PAST 3 YEARS, AND HE BLOODY WELL THINKS THAT THE WORSENING  SIDE EFFECT DESCRIBED ABOVE (WHICH HAS ONLY STARTED 6 TO 8 WEEKS AGO) IS ""BECAUSE OF MY CLONAZEPAM DOSAGE""......

7. SO NOW I FACE THE STRESS OF BEING FORCED TO START WITHDRAWING ETC AND I WISH I HAD NEVER EVEN BLOODY TOLD THE DR ABOUT THIS WORSENING SIDE EFFECT AS SO MUCH ELSE IS GOING ON IN MY LIFE JUST TO SURVIVE EACH DAY....

****** SO MY QUESTION IS THIS *******

A. HAS ANYONE ELSE ON HERE BEEN ON CLONAZEPAM ON A LONG TERM BASIS AND WHAT HAVE YOUR EXPERIENCES BEEN?

tw5sml,"Last night I realized I may have OCD Hey, I don‚Äôt know much about this whole thing but I realized last night after speaking to my boyfriend I may have it. So I just wanted to ask if anyone has my symptoms, or has a similar struggle because I‚Äôve been finding out so much.

A few years ago I developed PTSD because of a traumatic event. This event wasn‚Äôt sexual in nature, but it was just scarring but that‚Äôs important regarding my symptoms. But that was when I first remember when I would have panic attacks, and then scrub my body down with soap multiple times after or wash my hands. I wouldn‚Äôt have things super organized though, in fact I would leave trash and other clothing on the ground and hated cleaning it because then I felt like I lost things. This continued I guess it got worse in college living alone. 

I just thought it was a new thing with covid, as everyone was washing their hands constantly. I‚Äôve always had acne so washing my hands before I went to bed I thought kept bacteria off my face because I sleep with my hands close to my chest. And with food, specifically raw meat and deli meats, I thought everyone was hesitant to cook meat because of food poisoning or even touch it. The fear of smelling bad, or smelling other things that smelled awful I thought was just normal. No one wants to smell bad, and no one wants to smell trash or rotten food. Eating new things or trying new things is so anxiety provoking for me, but I just cracked it up to just not liking certain foods. All of those things, while they take up time, have a specific benefit to me so I thought it wasn‚Äôt anything to be worried about. But things just clicked last night as my partner broke down to me.

I‚Äôve always have a had a strong sense of smell, and I associate that with cleanliness. And body fluids or unknown fluids getting on me also make me incredibly anxious. So intimacy as a whole is really difficult for me.

Kissing is something I like, but if any saliva or any sense of slight dry mouth smell or just the smell of saliva is there, It makes me feel disgusting. If any musky smell is present on my partner, or if he hasn‚Äôt chewed gum or doesn‚Äôt have incredibly minty breath I can‚Äôt kiss him at all. Sometimes kissing his body at all when obviously, you‚Äôre sweaty and worked up makes me gag. And don‚Äôt even get me started on anything to do orally. I physically can‚Äôt do it without feeling like I‚Äôm going to have a panic attack, because the smell even if it‚Äôs freshly cleaned and the thought of semen makes me want to throw up. If he even breathes on me, or any hot air is on my skin while we are close i have to turn away my head.

So I told him that his breath smelled bad and that I didn‚Äôt like kissing with any spit at all. He wanted to kiss me, but I just would cut it off and have him kiss my neck. Any time I could even smell his skin, even out of the shower, unless it was the spot where cologne was sprayed, I couldn‚Äôt do it. And blowjobs are out of the picture. Being that close with that in your mouth and smelling everything just makes me panic. Semen in general is paralyzing for me. 

I told him to spray cologne so much and he drank so much water that he almost got water poisoning. He chewed so much gum his jaw hurt. And he didn‚Äôt know how to help, because he wanted to be intimate with me, and so did I but he couldn‚Äôt understand why it wasn‚Äôt working. When he would breathe on me I couldn‚Äôt be close, but it‚Äôs not like I could tell him that the air from his nose smelled, because then he wouldn‚Äôt be able to breathe. And it made him feel like I thought he was dirty, unclean, and disgusting. He broke down telling me this, and I realized then that I may have a problem. 

So if anyone is struggling with similar things, or has struggled and recovered please let me know. Because if anything has worked for you in the bedroom in order to get over your fears or face them, or with cleanliness and such I‚Äôm all ears. I love my boyfriend so much, and he loves me too. And I want to eventually enjoy sex without feeling anxious during and after because I feel contaminated or that my partner‚Äôs body is contaminated or dirty.",2,2,2022-04-04 12:09:23-04:00,last night realiz may ocd hey don‚Äôt know much whole thing realiz last night speak boyfriend may want ask anyon symptom similar struggl i‚Äôv find much year ago develop ptsd traumat event event wasn‚Äôt sexual natur scar that‚Äô import regard symptom first rememb would panic attack scrub bodi soap multipl time wash hand wouldn‚Äôt thing super organ though fact would leav trash cloth ground hate clean felt like lost thing continu guess got wors colleg live alon thought new thing covid everyon wash hand constantli i‚Äôv alway acn wash hand went bed thought kept bacteria face sleep hand close chest food specif raw meat deli meat thought everyon hesit cook meat food poison even touch fear smell bad smell thing smell aw thought normal one want smell bad one want smell trash rotten food eat new thing tri new thing anxieti provok crack like certain food thing take time specif benefit thought wasn‚Äôt anyth worri thing click last night partner broke i‚Äôv alway strong sens smell associ cleanli bodi fluid unknown fluid get also make incred anxiou intimaci whole realli difficult kiss someth like saliva sens slight dri mouth smell smell saliva make feel disgust muski smell present partner hasn‚Äôt chew gum doesn‚Äôt incred minti breath can‚Äôt kiss sometim kiss bodi obvious you‚Äôr sweati work make gag don‚Äôt even get start anyth oral physic can‚Äôt without feel like i‚Äôm go panic attack smell even it‚Äô freshli clean thought semen make want throw even breath hot air skin close turn away head told breath smell bad didn‚Äôt like kiss spit want kiss would cut kiss neck time could even smell skin even shower unless spot cologn spray couldn‚Äôt blowjob pictur close mouth smell everyth make panic semen gener paralyz told spray cologn much drank much water almost got water poison chew much gum jaw hurt didn‚Äôt know help want intim couldn‚Äôt understand wasn‚Äôt work would breath couldn‚Äôt close it‚Äô like could tell air nose smell wouldn‚Äôt abl breath made feel like thought dirti unclean disgust broke tell realiz may problem anyon struggl similar thing struggl recov pleas let know anyth work bedroom order get fear face cleanli i‚Äôm ear love boyfriend much love want eventu enjoy sex without feel anxiou feel contamin partner‚Äô bodi contamin dirti,"Sentiment(polarity=0.054161650315496475, subjectivity=0.4623060699983776)",0.054161650315496475,positive

Symptoms include; anhedonia, lack of motivation, mood instability - highs and lows (often), lack of self worth & desire to change things, not being able to get up in the mornings, get out of bed & sleeping too long, and anxiety (OCD). 

Past medication: Fluoxetine (Prozac), Sertraline (Zoloft), Escitalopram (Celexa), Paroxetine (Paxil), Venlafaxine (Effexor), Clomipramine (Anafranil), Buproprion (Wellbutrin), Buproprion & Fluoxetine, Modafinil [very short term] & Fluoxetine, Vortioxetine (Trintillex), Moclobemide & Aripiprazole (Abilify) & Clonazepam (Klonopin).

That was enough for me to not smoke  and drive ever again. And to not smoke at all actually. So I went a while without smoking and this obsession really destroyed me. Like the amount of panic attacks and anxiety I had. I was vomiting and going crazy. Thinking that I killed someone and that I was gonna get caught any moment and go to jail drove me insane. Even typing it makes me a little nervous üò¨. 

So fast forward to now and I‚Äôm back to smoking weed but not to drive ever lmao. I will not drive if I know I smoked weed that day. My anxiety would cripple me now if I ever did that. 

I‚Äôm telling all this because (this exact moment happened to me a couple months ago.) today I had to wake up earlier than I usually do. I had smoked around 2:20 am?? (Ignore my fucked up sleeping schedule) and woke up around 8:00 am 

I had to be somewhere at 8:20 am. And my mind was telling me I was still high to drive. I started driving and second guessing myself. ‚ÄúAM I still high??? Omg I feel weird I think it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm high‚Äù Mind you I‚Äôm now a chronic smoker and my tolerance is fucked. So realistically my high wouldn‚Äôt have lasted all through the night for me to wake up still high. 

LONG STORY SHORT. I almost began to freak out and feel sick. I had 10000000 negative thoughts telling me I was high and how horrible I was to be driving high and how I was definitely going to jail for killing someone. But I was most likely groggy from the lack of sleep and waking up so early.

I swear if OCD was a person I‚Äôd wanna beat the fuck out of them with an iron hammer. 

I got to my destination safe and sound. I didn‚Äôt kill anyone. I didn‚Äôt crash into anything. I drove the speed limit. Nothing happened. NOTHING. I realized how I cannot let thoughts crash with reality. I‚Äôm sitting there driving thinking all these fucking ridiculous things yet nothing is happening. I‚Äôm literally sitting in traffic thinking about ‚Äúhow high I am‚Äù and that I‚Äôm gonna kill someone??? Like what!! 

I‚Äôm sorry this was soooo long but It is what it is.

tvyjmw,"Someone please help me - Learning to have a ""normal"" (OCD free) shower Please help me. I compulsively scratch all the dead skin off my body every week. (I'm very adamant not to start doing it more than that because I know I won't be able to stop it)
It takes about half an hour of constant compulsive scratching. It leaves me with cuts and red marks and I just can't stop doing it. My whole shower takes 3 hours in total but it's the ""exfoliating"" that is the worst.

What is a healthy way to exfoliate that isn't scratching my skin?

Please note I cannot apply any lotions or use any moisturiser as part of my OCD I cant have things touch my skin (antibacterial soap/fresh shower water/fresh washed clothes/my hands (washed many many times first) aside).

I'm afraid to use any tools because I'd have to sterilize them first and I'm afraid they won't work as well as using my fingernails.

Honestly I'm terrified, but ultimately I cannot keep doing this, I'm desperate to change.
I can't cope not exfoliating at all, but I want to do it in a healthier way.

Please what can I do? Does anyone else have experience with exfoliating and OCD? 

Also how do you cope with the water hitting the shower walls and splashing back onto you? I spend at least 30 minutes trying to get the perfect rinse where no water splashes back onto me it's mentally exhausting.

I'm not even worried about getting sick, I just hate knowing that anything ""unclean"" has touched my skin?!

I'm desperate to change, I just want to be able to shower and not think, not count, not be symmetrical in every action, not have to wash my hands for 9 sets of 20 seconds before touching my skin. I'm so exhausted I don't know how to keep going like this and I've only barely touched on all the rituals. And this is JUST showering, not counting all the rituals outside of showering.

TL;dr
What is ""NORMAL"" exfoliating?
How can I cope knowing there's dead skin on my body? Would not exfoliating at all be bad?!
I can't apply products after my shower either (in the shower is fine).

tw3a8b,"possible OCD symptoms Hi everyone! I'm new to this community and I was just wondering whether anyone else has had similar experiences as me. I have not been ever diagnosed with OCD but I do have pretty intense anxiety in general so that probably feeds into what I've been feeling. When I was younger, I always used to feel the need to blink twice, sometimes four times, every time i blinked. My parents noticed and just assumed I had a tick. This lasted for a good 4 years roughly and eventually I stopped paying attention to it. However, for the last 8 years or so I've always had a preference for even numbers. Any time i walked somewhere I'd have to take an even amount of steps, or I'd take an even amount of bites when eating food. It was never motivated by any irrational beliefs though, I simply did it because I felt physically uncomfortable if I didn't. The main issue I'm currently dealing with is that every time I see something out of the corner of my eye, I need to see it again. This has become SO annoying recently because it sometimes happens only twice a day but other times (e.g. today) I just keep paying attention to it and so it's been happening about every 10 seconds. The worst times are when I'm typing or playing games at my computer because my pinkie finger is always sticking out and then I end up like waving my hands around my face in a really weird manner hoping to relieve the feeling of discomfort that I feel at the time. Obviously this becomes a problem when I'm working/studying because I'm embarrassed to do it in front of loads of people that I'm surrounded by but I can't just not do it because I feel so uneasy as if there's like spiders crawling over my neck. I have no idea why I feel like this and I don't know what to do about it because on days where I'm already feeling particularly awful, it just doesn't let me get anything done and I get so angry I just want to run away and cry.

tvyk9p,"Is this OCD? I'm not a psychologyst and don't rely on self-diagnosis, but I think I have OCD and don't know if I should tell my parents (3rd world country btw).

So basically, everytime I touch anything that's not my controller, headphone or my phone I need to wash my hands exactly 2 times, 3 times if what I touched had any history of being really dirty.

Then there's a process... i can't touch the sink or basically anything besides water and soap or else I start all over again, I usually stay for about 20 minutes washing my hands because I touched them charger of my phone, my hands have a white layer and they are very dehydrated (if anyone knows if it can be reversed or whatever please tell).

Even being slightly close to the sink will make me reset because I have these uh... visions of me touching the sink when I ""kind of know"" I didn't feel the sink in my hands (because idk, I kinda don't really trust my touch senses).

 I usually move stuff with my feet, I start to get VERY anxious and stressed out when there's something that might require my hands, so much I have to rethink many times before deciding myself if I should or not do it.

I try to avoid anything or anyone from touching my phone, controller or headphone.

Oh BTW, I can only touch part of my headphone which is the ""clean"" part so to speak.

I use a bottle of rubbing alcohol a month to clean those three things of I suspect they have been touched by my cat or just a bug.

Can't touch the surface my controller was in or elsd4i get the urge, not for the phone or ANYTHING, the exception is my bed. 

I also can't touch my wall, NO WALL, touching a wall even with my pinky will trigger the thoughts of getting my hands washed.

It's been like this since many years now and it has gotten worse with me crying whenever the bathroom isn't available when I need to wash my hands.

Oh, and I can't touch anything at all besides my controller, phone or headphone after I was my hands.

This curiously happens only in my house.

After going out, even to the ice cream store (at about 50 meters from home) I get the urge of taking a bath and then washing my hands again separately.

tve75a,"An Honest Assessment: and Being Totally Real With You Okay, so I have been on this subreddit for a while now. I‚Äôm a fellow OCD sufferer, and can empathize with the uncertainty and the mysticism that surrounds everything you do. But we gotta be real, and I think the purpose of this subreddit has to change. I notice there‚Äôs a great deal of us saying anything along the lines of ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt wanna live anymore‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to end it.‚Äù This is counterproductive to our condition. Instead, we really need to be posting honest axioms of life to counter our warped mentality and we also need to discuss the reality of the world around us to break through our illusions. The more we expose ourselves to healthier perspectives, the more it becomes engrained in our psyche. Isn‚Äôt that how we have become so advanced in our illness? Didn‚Äôt we literally engrain rituals and compulsions into our minds to counter the ideas that were also implanted within us? The way I have become healthier was through Christ, realizing I am loved and accepted regardless of my thoughts since I cannot help them. You should try it. But to elaborate on the axioms statement, here‚Äôs an example. When thoughts rush to our heads to induce anxiety, understand that thoughts occupy everyone‚Äôs minds, and we cannot help to expel it since we suffer from OCD. Is any moral force really going to condemn you, or if that‚Äôs of little concern, do you really want to commit to your thoughts if you‚Äôre mind is forcing it on you? The anxiety is a response because you clearly don‚Äôt want it, and in some way that should comfort you from rumination. You know you were stressed about it, therefore you didn‚Äôt want it. Understand the doubtful and questionable thoughts to counter that are simply a mental illness you cannot help. So no, you‚Äôre not on the same playing field as someone who wants a thought. I think if you ever really want to recover, you cannot expose yourself to the environment in which you want to recover from.

tvoh0i,"Four VALUABLE LESSONS I learned from OCD It's easy to view OCD as merely pointless suffering, devoid of any meaning or positive effect. Though the pain itself is certainly not good, and though I wouldn't wish OCD on my own worst enemy, my struggle with it has taught me some things. Though it's made me miserable at times, I don't think it's been entirely fruitless. In posing this I run the risk of sounding either preachy or prideful, as though I'm especially enlightened. I'm not. I just want to share with you my experiences and realizations and see what you think, and perhaps offer some hope and positivity. Here are four lessons OCD has taught me:

**1. Actions matter, feelings don't.** Feelings are often unhelpful and feelings need not always be acted upon. ERP is based on these principles. By not acting according to what our faulty emotions tell us, we gain strength and peace. OCD has helped me to become more courageous, even in non-OCD related anxieties and difficulties. For example, I had to go to the doctor the other day for something relatively intimate and awkward, and I was anxious about it. But because of my experience with OCD, I knew *I could tolerate the feeling of anxiety*. I was able to sigh, tell myself that my brain was just doing its ""brain stuff,"" and get on with going to the appointment despite how I felt. My attitude toward the feeling of anxiety itself is more healthy because of my experience with OCD. 

**2. A meaningful life is measured in meaningful action.** I remember a day when my OCD was really bad. I was plagued with uncomfortable thoughts and was worried about my sexuality. Y'all know how it is. That same day, however, I went over to an elderly woman's house to help her out with things. This woman is almost entirely bedridden and plagued with physical problems. The fact that I was able to help her that day was a blessing to both myself and her. Though my feelings were terrible that day, and I was filled with worries, I chose to do something meaningful despite my suffering. I was choosing to live a good life (in that moment). Of course, by only telling you this one story I'm painting too rosy a picture of myself; I'm not a saint. But, I learned that I can choose to do good and to make the world a better place no matter how I feel. This is a valuable lesson, because sometimes OCD leads to depression and despair, and we feel that life is meaningless because we are suffering. But there is more to life than our feelings. We can choose to do good, today, despite our suffering. 

**3. Vulnerability and Trust.** When I had my first really bad bout of OCD as a young teenager, I was confused and embarrassed. I had been told at a Catholic summer camp that it was a mortal sin to think impure thoughts. Though for a sin to be mortal it also requires FULL KNOWLEDGE at the time of sinning that the sin is mortal, and DELIBERATE CONSENT to the sin, I was plagued with worry that I had cut myself off from God's grace because of every thought that entered my head. I agonized over whether or not I was in a state of grace. Had I consented to the thought? Had I not? Maybe I should just confess it anyway. I don't want to go to hell. Etc etc. (Shoutout to my scrupulous Catholics - y'all know exactly what I'm talking about). I was confused, embarrassed, and miserable. I am naturally a more reserved person and didn't want to open up about it. Eventually, though, I told my dad about my worries. By some miracle, he immediately found out I was going through scrupulosity and noted that it's often a religious manifestation of OCD. This man is neither a psychologist nor a spiritual director nor an OCD sufferer himself. He just was able to tell what was going on, I think through doing some Googling. He was supportive and loving. Both my parents are. They helped me get help for OCD as a young high schooler. More recently, in college, I had another bad bout of OCD. I was ashamed and embarrassed because the content of my worries was simply embarrassing. The last thing I wanted to do was talk to another person about it. But, I knew that seeing a therapist would help. So I did, and now I'm doing so much better. OCD naturally creates a sense of shame and fear. It can be hard to reach out. But my experience has taught me that being vulnerable and trusting (prudently, of course) is a necessary skill of life. To go back to the first point, I didn't want to go see a doctor for my current problem either. But I knew from my experience of OCD that trusting professionals, even when it makes me feel vulnerable, is worth it. I am grateful both for my parents and for those who've helped me in my journey with OCD. 

**4. Compassion for others.** Even in my worst stages of OCD, most other people didn't really know what was going on. To others, I appeared normal. I was still going to classes and doing things. But I was really struggling. I would look at others and assume their lives were just fine and dandy while mine wasn't; that they were normal and happy while I wasn't. Then it occurred to me that they probably thought *I* was normal and happy. My experience with OCD has given me more compassion for people, especially those who are suffering mentally. I pray for those with mental illness and I want to devote my life in some way to helping them, however that may be.

I loved him so much and he was healthy but on Tuesday he started coughing and struggling to breathe I took him to the vet and they did a chest X-ray, a scan and blood tests. 

They said he had a mass in his abdomen that was likely cancer due to an insanely high calcium level in his blood and some other marker, they said it was in his lungs , liver and spleen. He was still sedated from his scan and they asked if I wanted to wake him up and take him home to die but I didn‚Äôt want him to suffer so I let him go while he was still sedated, I got to hold him.

But ever since the ‚Äúwhat ifs‚Äù are torturing me, I can‚Äôt sleep. What if they were wrong, what if I made the wrong choice, what if he was just sick and not dying and I‚Äôve killed him, then I started compulsively googling what else could cause those symptoms so then I‚Äôm like what if he ate something poisonous and them finding the tumor was a coincidence and he actually had more time left.

tvizmx,"Does it sound like I have OCD? It's never been something I've considered, but now I'm starting to believe I may have OCD. Here are some of my symptoms:

* Constant voice in my head that never stops, talking to myself every second I'm conscious
* It tells me what I can and can't do, e.g. I can't wear this shirt, I can't set down an item this way, I can't walk through this doorway, I can't say this, I must do this etc, if I walk up a staircase I must land on my right foot.
* If I place something down, I must fidget with it for a few seconds before being satisfied
* It convinces me that if I don't do or say these things, my life will essentially be over
* I often repeat the same phrases constantly in my head to calm myself
* Sometimes getting dressed can take 30+ minutes because I'll be walking in circles stressing over what I can and can't wear
* Always worried that someone can somehow hear my thoughts, or see what I'm seeing
* Everything is very rigid
* Extremely picky eater, mostly eat the same thing every day
* It gets overwhelming sometimes and I just start walking in circles
* When I'm ever writing or saying something, my word choice is very particular. The voice tells me exactly what words I can and can't use and even when I want to say something it won't let me

Just to name a few

I'm almost in disbelief right now. I've never had more 'typical' symptoms such as constantly washing hands, compulsively organized, etc., so I never thought it could be OCD, but after doing more research on the symptoms, It's honestly uncanny. I've never told anyone about this because I thought it would make me sound insane, but it sounds like it genuinely might be a real condition. Does this sound like OCD?

Its been an year since I realized that I have went down the rabbit hole because like now that I read these posts about people swinging, polyamorous, cuckolding. I get scared man but then I dont understand i get scared or like am I horny? Or am I anxious?. Please know that I have no interest in this, I'm not into this, I dont want this to happen but that what if?

I was reading the stories because like my porn brain wants that hit and I felt like my dick was moving, I just can get over it, the guilt and shame of getting upto that stuff. I know porn addiction makes you consume that stuff more but these things that are happening, what do I do? Im scared from this and like I dont know how ERP is gonna work or how I'm gonna live my life because I haven't been, I think like how everything could just stop or end.

tvmhe1,"I don't think I'll make it to 30 y/o. A little background about myself: I (25M) was diagnosed with OCD about 12 years ago, during that time I started excessive hand-washing to the point where even being exposed to air burns my skin, and it became really difficult to use my hands in normal day-to-day activities. I initially thought it was a phase and it will eventually come to an end, soon I started isolating myself and avoided any social events as I was fearing contamination, I also only went outside if necessary (school, dentist etc.) and usually wore gloves in the process.

Fastforward to 2016, I got the chance to study abroad and took the chance, as I thought that I needed a fresh start. The first few months were amazing, I rarely got any obsessions and if I do they are really mild, as soon as I settled in, my OCD became even worse. I lost control over my brain, I started to obsess over the slightest things and the fact that I couldn't get reassurance made it unbearable. Everytime I get over something, something else surfaces. I am really overwhelmed by the whole thing, and the fact that there are so many OCD triggers everywhere does not help at all. I spend 3-5 hours daily on washing clothes that I used outside, cleaning my laptop/backpack and washing my hands. There are so many things I want to do (i.e. get married) but its unfair to destroy an innocent girl's life because I couldn't control myself. I guess I am destined to live and suffer alone, and if it is the case I really hope my life doesn't last very long.

From I was pretty young, I started researching social issues, politics and other stuff, in a desperate attempt to have the correct opinion, because having a wrong opinion on a social issue that affects people would be bigoted and evil.

tvlm4o,"(F/16) I just want to die at this point Everything is a fucking compulsion, I cannot start talking to new people because I am scared that once they've been integrated in my daily routine they will leave and I will be left with that aching itch inside my brain. 

There is someone I'm talking to, that I have been talking to every day for a few months now and every time he breaks pattern in the texting intervals I feel like ripping my hair out. I don't even want to talk to him anymore, but I just have to, I cannot bear the thought of not replying to his boring and useless messages because otherwise I know something awful will happen and I will just end up feeling worse. 

Every time I see something I am left wondering if it was real or if I am in my schizophrenic headspace again. I keep going over it and over it, trying to make it out until I am convinced that nothing exists and that everything is just some immaterialistic shit. 

Every time I am at school, I need to wash my hands and cannot stop, I cannot touch anything afterwards and I know, I just know that if I was able to push my nail into my skin and draw blood that everything would be fine, but it never works, it never does. 

And everyone stares and my friends ask if everything is alright and the teacher asks and I am left staring at my hands, convinced there is flesh eating bacteria which has reached my insides and the open wounds on my hands just let parasites inside that are going along my bloodstream. How do I explain this to anyone? How? 

How do I explain anyone that I need to touch their hair or otherwise we are all going to painfully die? How do I tell anyone that I am so exhausted by everything that I can't even talk to them because I am scared of them becoming part of my routine and exhausting me to no end, how do I tell them that I can't eat their food because I just know that they are trying to poison me? 

How do I let go of everything, I cannot do anything anymore. I am living a life in my head that has no touch to reality that exhausts me and destroys everything good in my life. Everyone is so tired of me being constantly thoughtful and exhausted and in pain, no one wants to see me like that anymore. Even dying seems better than this.

tvkl4z,"can anyone pls help me out? i would like to start off by saying thank you for reading all of this bc i really need help and am too afraid to talk to my psychiatrist bc idk if i‚Äôm minimizing the severity of OCD, it‚Äôs the last thing i would ever want to do

i (21F) am diagnosed w severe BPD & CPTSD, which is why i‚Äôm worried that it may just üêù self control issues stemming from that versus having OCD. i‚Äôve heard there‚Äôs a subtype called contaminant OCD, and that‚Äôs what i‚Äôm curious about. here‚Äôs my list of reasons:

i cry when showering in other ppls bathrooms bc i cant handle the fact that i‚Äôm around so many household germs that are just clinging to me with the steam. also bathroom mats oh my GOD like i KNOW that a mf is not gonna take their shoes off to pee in their bathroom ( i mean i do bc i don‚Äôt want sneakers or
sandals on the mat where it‚Äôs literally supposed to üêù for my clean bare feet) so when i step out the shower i feel like i‚Äôm suffocating and trapped in one spot bc i can‚Äôt trust the mat or floor bc it‚Äôs not my home

i have to lysol spray my bed and sheets and pillows every night before laying in it in my pajamas (i carry one around always now bc i literally just can‚Äôt stand surfaces that idk who touched)

i have designated three towels that i will wash again if it is washed with anyone else‚Äôs laundry, i literally cannot consider it as safe to put on my body if it‚Äôs been on any surface or touched someone else that i have to thoroughly wipe it down with lysol. one is for my face, another for my body, and another for my hair. if any of them even brushes the floor for a second and i don‚Äôt have time to wash it i have to spray lysol over so i can use it again. these three designated towels also make it harder to shower anywhere else bc i don‚Äôt want them to touch any of my car seats or literally any surface at all bc it‚Äôs not my home so i don‚Äôt even bring them, no choice but to use someone else‚Äôs (washed ofc but that‚Äôs not enough for me) and it feels so disgusting i feel like i just wasted time showering 

i throw up if i have to use the bathroom at a public place that‚Äôs not clean enough to my standards; even the idea of even hovering near the toilet causes me to puke my guts out

once my brain even thinks for a second about something i need to clean or organize i HAVE to get it done right then and there or i‚Äôm so overwhelmed i can‚Äôt sleep, even if i wake up at three am and decide to deep clean my entire room, i‚Äôm SOL until it‚Äôs clean

if anyone messes up anything that i‚Äôve organized my body catches FIRE and it‚Äôs like i‚Äôm disgusted by the person and never wanna talk to them again

Background: I am currently a high school sophomore. I have a possible history with childhood OCD which faded by 8th grade. 

This post is not for reassurance, it is a genuine question that has been bothering me. During childhood, I experienced OCD symptoms without knowing of the condition. I was never properly diagnosed but with enough reassurance and reteaching from my parents, my symptoms completely faded.

My teacher expressed concern for me recently after I communicated my worry about my average in her class. She recommended therapy but does not know about my history with compulsion and reassurance. So, my only question is: Will OCD disappear after childhood and come back into adulthood? Does anyone share a similar experience? I do not suffer from past obsessions but I am worried and unsure if I should notify my parents about a condition relating to OCD or perfectionism.

tvruj4,"Was I wrong? Is this an OCD thing? Hi, a few days back I wrote in a long distance board to ask an advice because my bf (now ex) was ""searching"" for ways for me to get to the U.S and be a not long-distance couple (he wanted me to get a sponsor company). Sadly, the distance (4 hours only, we only saw each other twice a month) wasn¬¥\`t the motive for our break-up. I couldn¬¥t take certain behaviours anymore.

I couldnt be sad, angry or offended by anything he'd do because ""that wasn't true or he didn't do or say anything"". I can't believe this 6 months and an UGLY fight 4 months ago didn't make him more aware. 4 months ago he behaved exactly how he behaved yesterday, only the first time he call me names and screamed at me bc he had ""angry issues"". SO I was supposed to take that, but I knew better and I even told him to go to a therapist in order for us to get back, which HE DID but DROPPED IT OFF 1 MONTH later.

Weeks passed, we got together bc even though he dropped the therapy at least he supposedly learnt something which was that he should breath and think before throwing a tantrum or explode in rage.  
Other things he insisted on after his therapy was to live ""DAY BY DAY and that communication in a couple was everything"". He repetead this every time he could and told me that I should be more open to him cause he¬¥ was my bf, bla, bla. I always was scared to talk about things I didn't like bc of his prior reactions, but YES, I recognize my communication with people must improve.

Now right after I have an OCD episode (which I never showed that to him or anyone cause I want to keep my OCD private) and I tell him what happened he immediately askes me ""HOW YOUR MENTAL CONDITION IS GOING TO AFFECT OUR RELATIONSHIP?"". I told him I couldn't answer cause I didn't know and because I didn¬¥t want to point that it was the 2nd time he asked me that and that was unsettling. I told him that I was working hard by not letting my episodes by ruining my day with bad mood swings because it could cause me to get annoyed by everything. THEN he asked me ""do you get annoyed by me?"". See... I didn't want to respond cause no one wants to talk about those things when you're not even angry at the moment and I told him ""I don\`'t want to respond but since you told me I should be more open with you I must say YES, just like everyone gets annoyed with everyone"". Then HE asked me ""HOW DID HE GET ME MAD?""... long story short I told him that these kind of questions were selfish and weird to me cause it takes the conversation to something about him... as always (y'know, it was always something he'd do, he always directed my personal struggles towards him when it wasn't the case). And he acted like he didn¬¥'t get how it was selfish so I said an example: ""My OCD is something very personal and emotional to me just like your pets, imagine if right after your pet died I¬¥ would have asked you how that was about to affect our relationship?"" AND HE LOST IT. He told me I had offended him and how I dared to talk about his dog that passed away...  
We went like an hour back and fort, continued the day after that with he even calling me ""not even a perfect gf to be acting like that"" when I told him that I wanted a relationship where I had a voice and I wasn't getting it there with him. He even told me that I didn't appreciated how he gave his everything to me... driving 4 hours back and fort for us to see each other or tickets to get to places where he VOLUNTEERED to do so.  
Money or material things do not replace being free in your relationship, which I told him, in adittion to tell him that he should work on that thing going on where he can't accept his fails (because everytime I did so he would interrumpt me and say ""yes, yes, I am a shitty person, go ahead, no, no, that's not true"") but he didn¬¥'t say anything. So I blocked him and we're over. I feel so devastated but I couldn't take it anymore.

The day that I finally understood and believed that I had OCD I was able to think of it as a separate entity from myself. I visualize it like a chihuahua sized parasite that's latched onto me and feeds off of my anxiety and despair, so it pumps all these obsessive thoughts into my head to create anxiety and uncertainty

If I can think of it like that, it's easier to avoid getting sucked into an obsessive loop. I can resist just a little bit harder because I don't want to give the disgusting parasite the satisfaction of feeding off of me. The important thing is to understand that while OCD may have attached itself to you, it is *not* you and it is *not* your personality or thoughts or compulsions

tvqn6u,"I feel guilty having OCD, did I create unnecessary trauma for a friend? In year 7, around 12 years old I was diagnosed with Harm OCD, having intense and obsessive thoughts of harming others. Before my diagnosis, I told my school counsellor I really wanted to murder this one girl who was my closest friend, we‚Äôll call her ‚ÄúAmy‚Äù.

Obviously these thoughts were taken as being a danger to others and so I was suspended until I was giving a diagnosis and a letter from a psychiatrist saying I was safe to go to school. It took awhile but I eventually got the letter and was put on fluoxetine (an SSRI) and could finally go back to school. My other friends who were close with Amy knew about this as I couldn‚Äôt keep a secret but I made sure Amy was not to find out as she was a super anxious person and I didn‚Äôt want to cause her any unnecessary trauma. 

3 months go by and and all my symptoms of OCD legit vanished from the medication and I no longer had intrusive thoughts about Amy. One day, all of my friends and I went to the servo, Amy was there and asked why I was away from school for so long. My friends looked at me clearly uncomfortable and nervous and I just told her it‚Äôs better if she didn‚Äôt know. Now obviously that just caused her to become even more curious so she kept asking and I kept warning her that it‚Äôs better if she didn‚Äôt know. She kept begging so I explained to her that I had OCD, and what it was. She was confused and asked what that had to do with her, I told her I had thoughts about killing her a while back but I no longer have these thoughts and it was far from what I actually wanted to do. I thought it was pretty clear and I thought she took it well. 

We go back to school and she had told her school counsellor (which is a different school counsellor to mine who did not know about my situation) that I was currently having thoughts about killing her and that the information I gave her lead to her not getting any sleep and sleeping with her mum whilst keeping 3 knives under her pillow. She clearly freaked out when I told her this information at the servo and wasn‚Äôt paying attention to the fact these thoughts weren‚Äôt current nor was I a danger to her. 

I was suspended again despite having multiple doctors and medical professionals telling the school I was safe. Before the suspension though, I was called into the office with the Principal, Vice Principal and Well-being Coordinator, who screamed at me asking questions like ‚ÄúWhat is going on in your messed up brain?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhy do you think like a psychopath?‚Äù, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a murderer!‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know how to answer these questions as I had no idea why I had these thoughts. They kept interrogating me to the point where I was crying so much I couldn‚Äôt breathe and passed out. I woke up on the office couch and my parents couldn‚Äôt pick me up so I sat in the office for the whole school day until the school day ended and I walked home. 

A few months pass by and they finally let me back in after so many unnecessary documents stating I was safe. As the school year ended I left to a different school, and so did Amy due to not wanting to be around me. It‚Äôs been almost 3 years and I still feel guilty for the thoughts I had about this girl and I feel like I‚Äôm still haunting her to his day.",0,1,2022-04-03 22:16:01-04:00,feel guilti ocd creat unnecessari trauma friend year around year old diagnos harm ocd intens obsess thought harm other diagnosi told school counsellor realli want murder one girl close friend we‚Äôll call ‚Äúamy‚Äù obvious thought taken danger other suspend give diagnosi letter psychiatrist say safe go school took awhil eventu got letter put fluoxetin ssri could final go back school friend close ami knew couldn‚Äôt keep secret made sure ami find super anxiou person didn‚Äôt want caus unnecessari trauma month go symptom ocd legit vanish medic long intrus thought ami one day friend went servo ami ask away school long friend look clearli uncomfort nervou told it‚Äô good didn‚Äôt know obvious caus becom even curiou kept ask kept warn it‚Äô good didn‚Äôt know kept beg explain ocd confus ask told thought kill back long thought far actual want thought pretti clear thought took well go back school told school counsellor differ school counsellor mine know situat current thought kill inform gave lead get sleep sleep mum whilst keep knive pillow clearli freak told inform servo wasn‚Äôt pay attent fact thought weren‚Äôt current danger suspend despit multipl doctor medic profession tell school safe suspens though call offic princip vice princip wellb coordin scream ask question like ‚Äúwhat go mess brain‚Äù ‚Äúwhi think like psychopath‚Äù ‚Äúyou‚Äôr murderer‚Äù didn‚Äôt know answer question idea thought kept interrog point cri much couldn‚Äôt breath pass woke offic couch parent couldn‚Äôt pick sat offic whole school day school day end walk home month pass final let back mani unnecessari document state safe school year end left differ school ami due want around it‚Äô almost year still feel guilti thought girl feel like i‚Äôm still haunt day,"Sentiment(polarity=0.10416666666666669, subjectivity=0.42309027777777786)",0.10416666666666669,positive

tvom86,"OCD Sexual Theme Where to start.... I am a man in his early 30's who has had OCD since I was about 13 years old. I have been taking Paxil 20 mg and 16 grams of inositol daily (the latter for about 4 years) since I was around the age. I was treated pretty early on, within about 4 months of my first symptoms because they were quite severe and I have good parents that recognized I needed help. One of my current themes centers around sexuality.  

Back when I was 13 or 14 I became obsessed with women that wore thong underwear. It got to where I developed a fetish around thongs and also was masturbating excessively. This was a separate issue from the OCD, but when I started taking Paxil my OCD got better but this fetish also vanished and I felt like my masturbation habits became normal. 

I have not really thought about this until about 3 years ago. I became obsessed and frightened and kept searching about paraphilias and sexual addiction. This felt real because I think I really did have some type of fetish but it became much less powerful when on my SSRI. I felt really abnormal and like I have 2 illnesses at once and just felt really terrible.

tvnsm6,"is anyone making bets too? I thought for a long time this was only me and just a harmless thing, but after struggling with ROCD symptoms i digged deep down into existence of ocd.

 I was surprised how many variants ocd can have. I also noticed that from the young age i was making bets in my head. For example i play a game and my mind goes ""if you'll win this run, your relationship will last."" Or ""if you put out the dishes from the dishwasher in specific order without any mistake then [insert any desirable outcome] will happen. If i screw up, it depends if the bet was major or minor. For example sometimes its a deal with god. That's a major one and it can be really upsetting and stressful to screw that one.

To me, it's all about impulse phobia. Before going to sleep, if I wash my hands, I have to do not think of things such as ""i'm going to kill XX"" (it can be a friend etc...)

i can cancel the thing if i eat something

if i do it perfectly, i don't have to do it anymore for the future (even one year after), unless i do it again ..

i active the thing by falling asleep, it's only the last ritual which count, each go over the previous one.

I‚Äôm a 29 year old female and I am in a relationship of 1 year and 9 months with a 37 year old male. He‚Äôs expressed to me that he was diagnosed with severe adhd and ocd as a kid. We live together and from what I observed, his ocd causes:

- needing things to be extremely clean and orderly or he freaks out
- him to be late to appointments or other things where punctuality is necessary because he needs things to be a certain way (I.e., his suitcase needs to be packed perfectly or he has to change his outfit four times)
- him telling me what to do often which leads to arguments

I‚Äôm at a breaking point where I feel like I can‚Äôt do anything right and it‚Äôs impacting my mental health. He‚Äôs constantly (at least 5-10x/day) telling me what to do and if he doesn‚Äôt like something I‚Äôm doing, he will point it out and try to correct me. Things as big as how much I drink to how I put the forks in the dishwasher to how I put a coffee mug down on a table.

I love him dearly, but I‚Äôm just not sure how to stay in a relationship where it seems like I can‚Äôt do anything right. I want things to work out, but he seems just as frustrated with the situation as me and we don‚Äôt know where to go from here.

tv9sad,"ADHD meds and medidation helping urges. Triggerwarning : words relating to illness. 

Since starting to take my meds consistently, the urges to act on my compulsions are basically non existing. I haven't been on SSRI's for years because I didn't like how they made me feel, but stimulants are helping me think clearly and slowing down my racing thoughts. The thought pop up in my head, but i dont flinch or experience massive anxiety.  My fears are health related , specifically fear of cancer, to the point where i wasn't even able to say it or write it. I can say alzheimers without screaming mental compulsions in my head. 

 Meditating, mindfulness ,and being present in the moment helps me accept things as they are and that fears are simply delusions about future concepts/ideas/events. I'm sitting and breathing in, experiencing the anxiety, and i breathe it out. The anxiety just passes through like a gust of wind. 

If you ever struggled with concentration and racing thoughts, maybe talk to your doctor. It's common for people who have ocd to also have another disorder like ADHD.

If you ever tried meditating but felt more like it was mental torture, I really recommend the app Serenity with noise canceling headphones.

tve2h6,"I'm scared of being a controlling gf So, most of my themes are about my family, friends or my bf getting hurt. I get intrusive thoughts about hurting them or them getting hurt. I'm in a long term relationship with my bf (3 years) and he's aware of my OCD, I've taken my time to explain it to him and he understood. My bf and I text a lot through out the day, and ofc, sometimes we stop answering for a while bc we have responsabilities to attend to. Because of this, I've asked my bf to please tell me if he's not gonna answer for a long period of time, because I start getting intrusive thoughts about him being hurt or dead. He's totally okay with it, for example, when he has to go to class (some of his classes are 3h long and such) he just says ""hey I'm going to class now, love you"". But today he fell asleep in the middle of the day bc he hadn't slept well the previous night (which I didn't know) and ofc stopped answering all of a sudden. At first I was like ""he's probably busy"" then the hours start going by, and is start finding it weird bc he never takes this long to answer. 3 hours go by and it's definetly  weird behaviour for him, ofc I started getting intrusive thoughts about him being in an accident, being hurt or worse and i started spaming him with messages, not in angry way, just like ""hey I'm worried something happened to you, are you okay?"", ""I'm really scared and worried about something happening to you"", and stuff like that. Eventually he woke up from his nap and told me what happened, he wasn't mad but he started apologizing. I felt really bad and told him he didn't need to aplogize at all, that I knew it wasn't on purpouse and he was just tired.

tvaczg,"Real Event/False Memory(?)OCD Slowly Killing Me TW: Emotional abuse, self harm, suicide and rape mention

Hi, first time posting here. Unfortunately, this has a long convoluted story attached to it. A while back, I (then 17 F, now 19 F) cut off my ex-best friend of several years as her behaviour was becoming too much for me to deal with - she threatened suicide about fifty times in the span of a month and pinned it all on me, forcing me to choose between her and my then crush. Basically, ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt choose me I‚Äôll kill myself.‚Äù I repeated about 100 times how I wouldn‚Äôt do that, that I didn‚Äôt need to, that I could have more than one person in my life and value them both etc etc. I had called samaritans for her, phoned her mum, texted her big paragraphs about how much I cared for her and encouraged her to get professional help- I exerted myself as much as I could until I just got tired and couldn‚Äôt do it anymore. It was never enough. I was dissociating constantly at a party I was at with her because she self harmed in front of me because of me getting a notification from said crush, and started furiously hitting herself etc etc. Thing is, she claimed to have tics (round abour when this was ‚Äòtrendy‚Äô on tiktok) so I didn‚Äôt really buy it but nonetheless it was frightening because she done it violently whenever I was on my phone - ie, potentially talking to my crush. She also kept bringing up my old abuser asking if she reminded me of her - which, honestly, yeah. But I didn‚Äôt say that because who wants to be compared to their (then) best friends abuser? The night before I cut her off, she had apparently overdosed and was whisper-talking about how it was okay, how she was calm now, how this was what was best for her. I texted literally every mutual and adult we knew because of how much I was freaked out. My friend who studies medicine told me that if she had overdosed she wouldn‚Äôt be able to talk to me in such a manner. And I know that this was probably a fear tactic due to my gradually growing apathy but I find it so hard to reconcile that somebody would do that. I acknowledge now that her behaviour is most definitely the result of some untreated mental illness, and that it‚Äôs likely that I unfairly antagonised her. However, having someone‚Äôs life on your hands is understandably daunting for a 17 year old and, having previously been in an emotionally abusive relationship, her behaviour was freaking me out and it forced me to reflect on how she had generally treated me the past few years. I understand I am at fault here for enabling it, and I certainly am not free from guilt (I‚Äôd shut down and go quiet when I felt attacked most of the time, and I‚Äôd snapped back a few times) but she was generally pretty volatile and vindictive. I got accused of being a bad friend bc I had my notifications off while she was suicidal ‚Ä¶. she had sent me, no exaggeration, 75 texts and hundreds of calls. Literally. Like she freaked out at me for not telling her the day I bleached my hair, would accuse me of not caring about her when I got new friends, was constantly picking apart my appearance by like calling me ugly in my instagram account etc. Hell, I got the silent treatment for days because I dared to sing karaoke with somebody else once. Just, unkind shit with a bit of a victim complex - I vividly remember her gaslighting the shit out of this girl who had caught her chatting shit about her. She also told everyone that her ex bf had sexually assaulted her when they broke up. He very much didn‚Äôt. You‚Äôre probably noticing a pattern.

Now onto the OCD:
I‚Äôve had sexually intrusive thoughts since I was 16. This girl and I had had previous sexual encounters and I couldn‚Äôt have been older than 16 when they happened. Thus, I remember absolutely fucking nothing about them. Which freaked me out because when my OCD developed harsher I‚Äôd get all these false memories and thoughts like ‚Äúoh god what if I raped her and I didn‚Äôt realise it‚Äù etc etc. It‚Äôs genuinely debilitating and I can hardly live with it. Which is complicated by the fact that, shocker, that‚Äôs what she told people I had done. My friend pointed out that it was weird that she‚Äôd done that as soon as she learned I‚Äôd told these people about her low key abusive (I feel bad now even calling it that) behaviour. But I don‚Äôt know. What if I really did? I cant live with myself nor reconcile somebody, much less somebody I was so close to, lying about something like that. I‚Äôd hate to paint myself as the victim here when I could be the perpetrator without even properly realising it. My other friend said I would definitely remember doing something like that but would I? I was young, I could‚Äôve been poorly informed of consent compared to how I am now, I could‚Äôve been careless and not even realised it. I just don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt remember asking for consent and I don‚Äôt remember not asking for consent either. I remember nothing. Because I was like 15. And any images of things were conjured during OCD spirals so I know not to trust them logically. But it‚Äôs so hard not to feed into it. :( I feel that I don‚Äôt deserve to live. Especially because I learned that after I cut her off she really WAS in hospital because of breakdowns - only after I left though. Still. I feel horrid. What if it‚Äôs not OCD and it‚Äôs just guilt? I don‚Äôt know how to live w myself. Anyone who knows both of us hasn‚Äôt believed her but what if I‚Äôve like secretly manipulated everyone into thinking I‚Äôm the victim? I have very heavy moral scrupulous OCD and I reallt just want to make sure I‚Äôm handling this right. I just want to do the kind thing. I‚Äôm SO hyper aware during sexual stuff now, when I was with my now ex bf I‚Äôd freak out a lot that I‚Äôd sexually assaulted him and not realised, or was taking advantage of him, even though he told me 100 times that I hadn‚Äôt done anything wrong and that he‚Äôd tell me if I did. I‚Äôm so scared of going out and hanging out with people because what if I do have the capacity to seriously hurt somebody to like that?

tv2jdu,"I cant leave the house without checking multiple times that everything is off/unplugged/locked/etc. The title states the problem, and it doesn‚Äôt sound too bad I know. But, it is really getting in the way of me leaving my house. It‚Äôs come to the point where I only leave when I absolutely have to because I‚Äôm afraid that when I actually do leave, something will happen like we get robbed, or there‚Äôs an unexpected electrical fire, or my animals somehow escape, the list goes on. The fears warp depending on the day. I have a vague routine that I go through, starting by unplugging everything, even the TV that‚Äôs already turned off. Then I unplug things from the extension cords (that are already unplugged). I go and lock my windows and double check that they‚Äôre actually locked. Then I go through and make sure that all the faucets are not leaking, and that I didn‚Äôt accidentally leave anything else on. I lock all the doors, turn off all of the lights, and then run through my house like 10 more times checking that I actually did do all of the things that I just mentioned. I know it sounds absurd, because why wouldn‚Äôt the window be locked after I just locked it?? I take pictures of my room and the outlets to just be 100%, and take pictures/videos of me closing and locking the front door. Even while doing these things I feel crazy, but I feel like if I don‚Äôt do them then something bad will happen. This process seriously hinders my ability to get to work on time, or about anywhere. And you can probably see why it is so hard for me to leave the house. I hate this, and no one I tell really understands the extent of it, not even my therapist.

But I was just wondering how many top-class athletes would have OCD?

The reason I'm asking this is that I think if they did get unwell they would be able to tolerate and endure the intense discomfort of ERP better? Since they are used to extreme levels of pain in their training. And when playing.

The same question could be posed to percentages of Navy Seals, S.W.A.T. teams, and even Buddhist Monks?

tv0gu3,"DAE try fixing something to the point where you make it worse than before? Not too long ago, I had a pair of Nike Dunk High ""Kevin Bradley's."" They were a white & red pair of sneakers made to be skated, so the toebox wore away red. This red matched the accent color that was already visible. I purchased them used. However, no red was visible on the toebox. After thoroughly cleaning them and attempting to get them as new looking as possible, I wore them out to go ride my bike with friends. Unfortunately, I missed the pedal while stopping at a light. My foot slipped and the pedal scraped a top layer of white paint, revealing the red underneath. This pissed me off, but I tried to forget about it as soon as I could. Sadly, this did not happen. I spent hours thinking about the scratch, how it looked bad, as well as how it didn't match the other toebox. I stayed up at night watching YouTube videos on how to fix this. I purchased paint pens, but only made the scratch worse. I threw them in their box, threw the box inside my closet, and tried to stop thinking about them. I couldn't, though. They were inside of my head, trying to break me. This went on for months, until I woke up at two AM one day, and took them into the bathroom. I took some alcohol, and rubbed hard. I used dozens of q-tips, cotton balls, everything you could think of. I couldn't get the edge of the leather coated in acetone, so I kept ruining more and more q-tips trying to get the white completely off. In the process, I rubbed too hard. I essentially burnt the leather. The red one each toebox was different. My stomach hurt, and I couldn't stand to look at them. (I feel like I overreact a lot, this is one of those moments. I can't help it though.) I threw them in the closet, once again, and tried to sleep. Not satisfied with my fuck up, I went back and tried fixing them, AGAIN. Mere minutes after I ruined them (for the second time.) I got out paint pens, tried to match the color, nothing. I gave up. I took pictures of them, put them up on GOAT, and waited for someone to purchase them. Once they were gone, I was satisfied. The original scratch wasn't a huge deal. Just a small mark of red, nearly in the middle of the toebox. I turned that into ""burnt"" leather and mismatched colors. I hated, and still hate myself over it.

First issue is reading, I love reading to death but I can‚Äôt do it anymore. Whenever I try to read my brain immediately imagines the characters as younger than they really are. It‚Äôs only started being like this since January or February. My imagination is so vivid and active and I used to love it but now it‚Äôs destroying my life. I don‚Äôt want to think of the characters like that. I don‚Äôt want these thoughts, I wish I was normal again. Whenever I imagine anyone, really, that I don‚Äôt have a visual for it immediately assumes that they are young. I also can‚Äôt comprehend myself well anymore to be able to base my mental imagery for characters. I‚Äôm 17 and a female but I can‚Äôt comprehend that I‚Äôm 17. Like the thought won‚Äôt get through. This happens when I try to pray, or listen to religious lectures as well. It immediately puts the face of someone I don‚Äôt want in my mind and I can‚Äôt get it out. 

I also have issues with my emotions, I feel so numb, like I can‚Äôt feel a thing. I used to cry and cry but now I can‚Äôt do anything, and that in if itself makes me want to cry and panic. Does anyone else have this? Has it gotten better? I‚Äôm scared, and I feel alone.

tv3grk,"medication/worsening? I've been diagnosed since i was around 15; but i went off anti-psychs for a while and decided in december to start taking medication again. I had pretty severe depressive symptoms, but with the max lexapro i've been taking my OCD has stayed the same. I still have to check everything before i leave, and stare at stuff directly, leave my room at least every 20 minutes during the night to flush the toilet, check the stove, and stare at my ferrets cage. Sometimes; when i go to work, i'll drive, and drive back to check things again, and i have to touch all  my car windows getting out.

It's caused me to be late to work everyday; and its getting in the way.

The worst part is; i'm scared of my pets dying and i fixate on it all day. i stare at them and make sure they're breathing when they're asleep, and disrupt them and wonder if im a good animal parent.

It's starting to get unbearable. I have to cross the street in a certain way or else i think it somehow connects to my day in some way and will predict what kind of day i'll have.. or even going past a stop light getting ready to change colors.

it also gets annoying to where i tell myself through my own mouth verbally ""i wish i didnt have this"" 

as i drive myself back home, wasting gas, or checking stuff constantly for reassurance.

the funny thing is. I know the things are fine. but in my eyes it seems like my car doors are wide open, or my ferret cage is open, etc.

I also get paranoid and have to touch my debit card to make sure its still in there after buying anything...  these things i feel are more than obsessions, and more fixations. it's hard for me to leave because i feel like i'm putting everything at risk.

I also leave somewhere and i KNOW i've lost something, despite not losing it, and i get so paranoid thinking i actually lost something and it keeps me up all night.

theres more, like washing my hands after i've touched anything (even my body) thinking i'll catch something or give it to someone i love dearly. especially with piercings (my own). or cleaning trash at work, and i smoke, i feel like im breathing in trash after touching it.

I also used to walk down store isles and would have to touch specific items or else somehow unrelated someone would die that i cared abt if i didnt specifically touch something in the face wash section, or pick the right wipes to clean, etc. its driving me crazy.

I've considered therapy, i've been in it before.. but it's rather expensive; and i'd like to talk to a doctor abt regular medications that regulate OCD. I don't wanna go down anti psychotics again cuz i felt like a zombie but i can't go the rest of my life at the extremities where i put my paranoid thoughts and delusions first, no consent, rather than doing other things.

tv0bqb,"OCD has been causing me two big problems. The first problem I have is with it forcing me to do things that would make me uncomfortable or upset. Throughout my day it will be like ""hey, go online and check out this place and see if there's anything about this topic that you don't like, even though hearing or seeing anything about it can make you uncomfortable. If you don't, I'll fill you with anxiety, discomfort, and intrusive thoughts until you do."" I hate having these urges, yet it feels like I have to give into them.

The second problem happens at night, and it's various urges that keep me up until I satisfy them. For some reason, I can't go to sleep if I have even the slight feeling I have to pee. Even if I just went two minutes ago, I still can't sleep until I go to the bathroom. I also can't sleep until I make sure every light is off, faucets aren't running, doors are locked, and the fridge is closed. ANd I have to press against them five times each to make sure they are, and I can't do it six times because 666 is a satanic number and my brain believes something bad will happen if I do something six times. This is especially bad because I might be keeping my roommate awake since my door creaks loudly and my footsteps are loud.

tuv2dt,"Psychiatrist says emotional numbness can be caused by OCD - Is this true? Hello everyone,

I'm F29, and for almost 16 years, I have been experiencing emotional numbness, apathy and inability to feel joy, which was developed some time after the onset of my OCD at the age of 13 (Pure O kind to be specific). I'm not visibly sad or in despair, just empty and blank and in my head all the time. Life passes by but nothing and noone truly touches me. This bothers me immensely because I know that my ability to feel is burried somewhere inside, but I have no access to it. It's almost as if I am emotionally anesthetized.

I'm in CBT therapy at the moment and according to my psychiatrist, I only meet the criteria for OCD, or obsessional neurosis as he calls it. Even though I feel chronically empty and can't experience joy, he says I absolutely don't meet the criteria for depression, and OCD is to blame for my chronic emotional numbness. 

Is this possible? Does OCD really have that power to divest a person of their feelings and their soul? What's ironic is that my OCD focuses precisely on overanalyzing and endlessly ruminating about my emotional reactions to things, causing me to always be hypervigilant about how I experience things.",10,2,2022-04-02 18:28:12-04:00,psychiatrist say emot numb caus ocd true hello everyon im f almost year experienc emot numb apathi inabl feel joy develop time onset ocd age pure kind specif im visibl sad despair empti blank head time life pass noth noon truli touch bother immens know abil feel burri somewher insid access almost emot anesthet im cbt therapi moment accord psychiatrist meet criteria ocd obsession neurosi call even though feel chronic empti cant experi joy say absolut dont meet criteria depress ocd blame chronic emot numb possibl ocd realli power divest person feel soul what iron ocd focus precis overanalyz endlessli rumin emot reaction thing caus alway hypervigil experi thing,"Sentiment(polarity=0.03614718614718617, subjectivity=0.5893939393939394)",0.03614718614718617,nuetral

tupuwj,"How to deal with intrusive thoughts that have some truth to them? I am aware that usually intrusive thoughts are not an accurate representation of what you actually believe or think, quite the opposite in most cases. However, sometimes one may notice there may be some truth in a thought. For example, if someone gets the very common ROCD intrusive thought of like ""i can do better than my partner (can be specific to a certain quality or not)"". I am sure if this person tries to pursue someone who is or has a better quality X , they might be able to.

I am not saying this person even wants to but they may be aware of this because of the intrusive thoughts. However, of course this is unrealistic since then either other qualities will lack or realistically where does it end? How many times will this person try and pursue someone who has a subjectively or objectively better quality X?

tusau1,"Dealing with depression / Obsessive-compulsive disorder Hello, I have, for the past 3 or so years been suffering from major depression. I believe the underlying cause for this is Obsessive-compulsive disorder, as I am constantly having negative thoughts about one thing in particular (I am not very comfortable sharing specifics, sorry). Having these thoughts all the time is extremely difficult and stressful. Once the thought comes in, it is very difficult for me to stop thinking about it, which sometimes sends me into little panic attacks. It feels like I worry/get triggered by these thoughts so much that it makes me (uncontrollably) think about them more. Even if I am not exposed to anything related to them, sometimes I will spontaneously feel the ""feeling"" that the thoughts give me before I actually have the thought itself, which of course leads me to have that thought. I really don't want to have these thoughts anymore, it is destroying my mental health.

I was hoping that anyone with this problem, or who has had this problem in the past would share a bit about how they were ""cured"" or how they are able to actively deal with/suppress these thoughts.

tup55s,"could I have ocd? First off I'm not looking for a diagnosis,  just basically whether I should bring the possibility up in therapy. 

First reddit post so I apologize if this isn't where its supposed to go, also trigger warning I think for scrupulousity and religion.

I started therapy a couple months ago and my therapist said that what I was telling her I struggle with was distorted thoughts, I often struggle with circling very anxiety indusing thoughts, specifically about religious things I can't rationally disprove to myself, when I was a kid/teen (I'm 23 now) I used to obsessively pray prayers a certain combination a certain amount of times or I believed something bad would happen, I believed if I read/watched anything ""bad"" I'd get a demon attached to me, it got so bad that for a while I didn't do anything and basically never left my room, I was eventually forced into a situation where I had to do things and that kind of disproved my thoughts and forced me to interact with other Christian teens and I could kind of rationalize that if they watched Dr strange and weren't worried about getting possessed or going to hell I didn't have to either,  but recently its getting worse again,  I have to find a reason in the Bible that let's me do things,  and sometimes when I do something/read something (example,  hang out with a friend who's gay) I have to basically accept that what I'm doing is going to send me to hell, I also worry that if I don't go back to being as scrupulous lll have a terrible life and nothing will go right for me bc I'm disobeying God,  I can't sleep for hours every night bc these thoughts and worries circle in my head around and around and I try to argue against them I try to settle them but even if I come up with a good reason I shouldn't be worried that only 'works' for a small time. I used to do this for other things as well,  I chdck my door lock every night and I can't sleep with closets open, I have a reoccurring fear someone is hiding in my wall. I know all of these are unreasonable but I  can't stop them and the longer they go on the more real they feel.

tun1wl,"I am lost last week I was diagnosed with OCD, on top of my already existing anxiety and depression. Discovering it felt like it freed me however I ended up making everything much much worse. I started subconsciously being honest in every aspect of my life because of OCD and it began changing my life greatly. I started improving marks in school and overall became much more socially adjusted, temporarily. People began seeing me at school and genuinely wanting to talk to me which is something I never felt before. However these pros did not last as the cons began to show very quick. I thought I finally discovered my key to happiness and was entirely convinced that I cured my depression but it was just OCD. yesterday, at my dead end fast food job, I was still being ‚Äòhonest‚Äô or whatever I call it, which is unprofessional but mostly everyone in the store is unprofessional (with good hearts at least) however but customers began getting a rise out of me because of how unprofessional I was acting. This ended up with a lady cursing and screaming at me and I lost control and had to walk to the back of the store and burst into tears. I ended up punching something and completely scratched up my hand. I was almost aware of what I was doing in the moment but I couldn‚Äôt stop myself and the entire situation began to spiral. I feel guilty because it was already a stressful night for my coworkers and I made their night entirely more stressful. Later that night some customers most likely on drugs came through the drive thru and began complaining trying to get free food. In the moment nothing mattered to me so I just told them to fuck off and go somewhere else. They went and complained to my manager and now I may be getting fired depending on how far the situation goes. This led me to a few discoveries, I am too emotionally fragile to work fast food, My OCD is going to get me killed and I am completely fucked being human. I don‚Äôt know what to do.

Possible TW - ocd symptoms and sensitive subjects
Hi. I‚Äôve not actually been diagnosed with ocd (yet) so I hope it‚Äôs alright if I talk on this sub. I really don‚Äôt want to self diagnose because I know that‚Äôs not right but I do want to try to get diagnosed. I‚Äôm just not sure what the best way of doing that is. I‚Äôll describe a little about my ‚Äòsymptoms‚Äô. I have the most ‚Äòcommon‚Äô one I guess, fear of contamination. It started around when covid began and it started with just me being wary. However it then worsened and I now have to wash my hands whenever I feel like I‚Äôve touched something contaminated and sometimes I have to wash them again if I didn‚Äôt think I did it right. This is to the point where my hands are red and are splitting. Also linked to this I can‚Äôt wear my ‚Äòoutside‚Äô clothes in my room and I get stressed if people touch my things. I also have symptoms that I think link to magical thinking ocd but I‚Äôm not sure. I have a fear of a specific illness so much so that I cannot say it but I‚Äôm sure you probably know which one. If someone even mentions it I have to count. It‚Äôs always counting 10 times 5 times if that makes sense. That‚Äôs really my only compulsion (apart from a few different ones every now and then). My obsessive thoughts mainly circle around becoming ill or making people I care about ill or something happening to them. I also have other obsessions but they come and go and change around which makes me feel like I‚Äôm making them up even more. They‚Äôre surrounded by things like if I say anything around wanting to ‚Äòend myself‚Äô (btw I don‚Äôt and I refrain from saying things like this because it‚Äôs disrespectful) but sometimes it just comes into my head and if it does I have to immediately take it back and count. A lot of those ones are about contradictions. If I say something contradictory I have to count otherwise the bad thing of that scenario will happen to me. If this sounds like ocd to you or specific types of it please let me know. Also, if you know the best way to seek help or any tips for trying to maintain this on my own I‚Äôd really appreciate it. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs fairly moderate at the minute but my main worry now is that it‚Äôll get worse. Thanks for reading all of that and again I‚Äôm really sorry if it seems like I‚Äôm self diagnosing, I don‚Äôt like doing it but I think it‚Äôs necessary if I want to seek help. Also I‚Äôve never really shared anything like this publicly so I‚Äôm a bit nervous aha.

tum91n,"(Tw:sa) Certain survivor accounts making me question my judgment in my past sexual experiences. One survivor went on a date and ended up at his house. Her stomach hurt so she said nothing below the belt. He offered her painkillers. Later, she said she felt a little better and he kissed her, which was okay for her, but his hand went lower. She couldn‚Äôt say no because of feared retaliation and went with it. However she said she made it clear nothing below the belt and he disregarded it. 

Another survivor said she went on a date and was a virgin. The guy invited her over, began kissing her and she froze from anxiety, couldn‚Äôt speak up and yeah. 

I see boundaries were crossed in the accounts. I assume the survivors froze in an obvious way and the men genuinely ignored signs they saw‚Ä¶but I also think these stories highlight murkiness I could‚Äôve been susceptible to. 

Account 1, I think if a girl said ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt have sex because _‚Äù then old me might have thought once the reason was gone, it was okay to try again. I‚Äôd factor in her mood and whatnot and not overbearingly reinitiate but still.

tum6wi,"need advice on my ocd apologies in advance if this seems a little more like a rant, having OCD just frustrates me. 

My main problem with OCD is intrusive thoughts and compulsions. The compulsions aren‚Äôt as severe as they used to be, as I decided to just challenge them head on and realise how stupid some of them were. They still exist in some parts of my life though, but I think I‚Äôm making progress and I‚Äôve decided to just recognise the compulsion, and then either do it/not do it depending on what it‚Äôs about and where I am at that time.

The intrusive thoughts is where my main issue lies. My intrusive thoughts tend to be of my past, with only my current one being on an ongoing issue. The ones from the past are mainly about me being picked on in school when I was a kid and scammed online in my early teens. For some reason, my OCD is extremely revenge driven, with issues from a couple years ago still making me angry. I feel like these people should be punished by me for what they did, even though it would be extremely petty and stupid.

Oddly enough, my most recent intrusive thought has made other past ones die down a bit. With my current intrusive thought, some kid who I don‚Äôt know from my school is intentionally annoying to me on a basis of once a week or so. Even though this kid is a couple years younger than me, my brain feels hardwired that he deserves some sort of punishment (eg attacking him) for being annoying. Unfortunately, this thought has latched onto parts of my daily life too. For example, I have a song that I really like, but my brain has associated the thought of this kid being annoying over this song. Now, I am scared to listen to the song, because my OCD tells me that the song will trigger the thought and that whenever I hear the song, for the rest of my life the thought will be reminded to me. It sounds a bit stupid typing this out, but it‚Äôs the reality of what I‚Äôm facing right now and it‚Äôs wearing me down. Luckily for me, I am leaving my current school in a matter of months, but my brain keeps telling me daily that my time is running out to give this annoying kid a ‚Äúpunishment‚Äù. And that if I don‚Äôt do that, I will think for the rest of my life about how I failed to give this kid what they ‚Äúdeserve‚Äù. I was in a similar situation a couple of years ago where this kid in my year would harass me and sometimes steal my food. The thought isn‚Äôt as intrusive as it used to be, but I still sometimes think about how I need to ‚Äústeal something back‚Äù to even out the odds between us. As well as this, I have a compulsion to work out so that I can deter people who annoy me, which in itself is annoying.

If you actually read this far, I guess all I can say is thankyou for taking the time. I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôm looking for with this, I haven‚Äôt gone to therapy about it and quite honestly I‚Äòm not sure I want to due to me being very busy at the moment with tests. So in the meantime whilst I‚Äòm figuring stuff out still, is there some sort of ‚ÄúDIY therapy‚Äù or advice I can use to ease what I‚Äôm currently experiencing in my every waking moment?

Edit: weirdly, one of my main compulsions is making sure I hear perfectly what everyone says. I tend to do it a lot without noticing daily, but it sometimes annoys people that I constantly ask them what they said earlier that day. My brain likes to tell me that if I don‚Äôt ask them what they said, I will regret it. A lot of my compulsions tend to be around regret, so that could have a hidden meaning. Like, another compulsion I have is screenshotting what I see a vast amount. All it does is take up storage space, but my brain seems to make me think I‚Äôll regret not having the proof of watching a certain video or seeing a certain post after it was posted.",9,2,2022-04-02 12:01:21-04:00,need advic ocd apolog advanc seem littl like rant ocd frustrat main problem ocd intrus thought compuls compuls aren‚Äôt sever use decid challeng head realis stupid still exist part life though think i‚Äôm make progress i‚Äôv decid recognis compuls either itnot depend it‚Äô time intrus thought main issu lie intrus thought tend past current one ongo issu one past mainli pick school kid scam onlin earli teen reason ocd extrem reveng driven issu coupl year ago still make angri feel like peopl punish even though would extrem petti stupid oddli enough recent intrus thought made past one die bit current intrus thought kid don‚Äôt know school intent annoy basi week even though kid coupl year young brain feel hardwir deserv sort punish eg attack annoy unfortun thought latch onto part daili life exampl song realli like brain associ thought kid annoy song scare listen song ocd tell song trigger thought whenev hear song rest life thought remind sound bit stupid type it‚Äô realiti i‚Äôm face right it‚Äô wear luckili leav current school matter month brain keep tell daili time run give annoy kid ‚Äúpunishment‚Äù don‚Äôt think rest life fail give kid ‚Äúdeserve‚Äù similar situat coupl year ago kid year would harass sometim steal food thought isn‚Äôt intrus use still sometim think need ‚Äústeal someth back‚Äù even odd us well compuls work deter peopl annoy annoy actual read far guess say thankyou take time i‚Äôm sure i‚Äôm look haven‚Äôt gone therapi quit honestli i‚Äòm sure want due busi moment test meantim whilst i‚Äòm figur stuff still sort ‚Äúdiy therapy‚Äù advic use eas i‚Äôm current experienc everi wake moment edit weirdli one main compuls make sure hear perfectli everyon say tend lot without notic daili sometim annoy peopl constantli ask said early day brain like tell don‚Äôt ask said regret lot compuls tend around regret could hidden mean like anoth compuls screenshot see vast amount take storag space brain seem make think i‚Äôll regret proof watch certain video see certain post post,"Sentiment(polarity=-0.028758503401360536, subjectivity=0.4854591836734696)",-0.028758503401360536,nuetral

tujlp6,"Obsessive Compulsive Thoughts. Hi. Life has been very difficult, especially lately. I have been told by at least three different professionals (one therapist, one doctor and one neuro specialist) that I am a ""complicated case"". Basically, because of a bad accident I was in as a child, they cannot tell what is mental illness or the product of brain injuries. But they do know that, whether the consequence of unlucky genetics or an unfortunate accident, I live on the bipolar spectrum. A characteristic of which can be some ODC tendencies. I have obsessive compulsive thoughts and I have been struggling with them so badly. It tends to get worse when my life is not going well and after finding water damage in my home, discovering heinous mentalities amongst my family members, reliving trauma in therapy, a bad break up, and a $1000 hospital bill; I feel I am spiraling.   
I feel like I want to control everything but I have control over nothing. The less control I have over my own life the more I think over and over about how I want to control the entire world. I think about all the laws I want to change. I think about how I want the environment to change. I think about all the people I want to help and I think about all the things destroying the earth and how I wish I could eliminate all of it. But it goes beyond simply imagining. I obsess and think of ways to do it all. How I can change these things but logically I understand that even if I could change 1 thing, it is humanly impossible to change the 100000000 things I obsess over. I get so anxious and depressed knowing that this imaginary world I picture in my mind will NEVER exist in my lifetime. I am unraveling. 

Does anyone out there experience this? Anyone out there know how to make this stop? I can't let it go. Logic does nothing. I keep going to this ""better place"" in my mind and I can't stop obsessing over the idea of making it reality and then stressing over how impossible that is.

tu11mx,"I just don't have what it takes At the moment, I don't brush my teeth most days, and the days I do, I only do it at night. I can't remember the last time I had a shower (I clean myself sometimes with baby wipes). My parents make sure I eat, if they didn't I probably wouldn't.

From what I gather of how people go about life, the bare minimum seems to be to brush your teeth twice a day, shower every day, make your own food, do your own laundry, do your own washing up, get a job, deal with people, and probably more that I've forgotten, though people's idiosyncratic circumstances and stuff result in different experiences.

The bare minimum is too much for me. It's too hard and completely unenjoyable, and I can't say I have any desire to go through it. To be honest, I don't seem to have any desire for anything anymore, just fog and numbness.

I can't even seem to muster the energy to try anymore. Surely all the therapies and medications we've tried, something should have helped by now, so all I can think is that it's down to me not trying hard enough or not being strong enough.

A large portion of my OCD revolves around intrusive thoughts based on whether I'm a bad person etc. But there's also a huge portion which is just being super anxious about the fact that I have OCD. I get scared that I'll never be able to escape it and that this is with me forever. What if it never goes away? 

I recently moved out of home and I keep getting anxious about not coping because I have OCD. Or how I won't ever be able to 'be in the moment/present' because I'll just be ruminating. 

Does anyone else get super anxious about having OCD in general and what that means for your life? Will I ever be able to live alone? How will I ever be happy with this illness? Will it ever go away?

My OCD greatly revolves around contamination and my biggest fear for years has been bed bugs. I have a lot of anxieties but this by far beats them all because when it‚Äôs triggered my life just stops.

The thing is that I‚Äôve had episodes of this fear plenty of times and I know that it‚Äôs possible to imagine all kinds of symptoms. I had a major episode last summer and when it was triggered again 2 weeks ago I seemed to take it much more rationally.

Only that this time I actually started finding actual marks of an infestation in my home which has never happened before. Blood on sheets, stuff that can‚Äôt be imagined.

I‚Äôve informed my landlord and action is taken soon but I don‚Äôt know how could I handle this shit, really? Non-ocd people lose it with these things.

tudgdt,"Rocd? I‚Äôm obsessed with how mad my exes new relationship is, even though I‚Äôm happy for him? I have a weird situation that I will try to explain. I‚Äôm sorry this will be long. I need to get it off my chest. 

I met a guy a few years getting out of an abusive relationship. He was getting out of an abusive relationship too. I told him that meeting him as a friend was like a breath of fresh air, and that he was so respectful. He said something weird like ‚Äúguys all want the same thing‚Äù but I was like uh ok whatever. 

He was genuinely really nice honestly, picked me up from an hour away multiple times to protect me from my abusive ex, and let me sleep in his spare bedroom. Got me dinner and let me just watch silly movies with him.

Anywho, I ended up falling in love with him but I didn‚Äôt want to hurt our friendship so I kept it to myself. We slept together once while under the influence, it never happened again.

Years went by and my feelings didn‚Äôt change. I knew he had them too. I didn‚Äôt date anyone else but I was thinking we were taking things slow. I finally got the guts to tell him how I felt, and he said he felt the same way but wasn‚Äôt ready. I respected that and waited another year. A year passes snd I decided I want to bring it up again, we are really close best friends by this point. I book us a really nice vacation at the fanciest hotel I could afford in San fransisco, and bought vip tickets to a concert. I wanted it to be special; but I had the hotel room with 2 separate beds in case it didn‚Äôt go how I expected. He bailed on me last minute, for no good reason. The thing about him was, he had ptsd from being a war vet and his ex wife cheated on him horribly so I always gave him the reason of a doubt when he cancelled on me. I was really understanding. He was so nice, the wait was worth it to me. But I had had enough after spending thousands of dollars for him to stand me up this time. 

We had been friends/seeing each other for 4 years by now.

So a few months pass and I start casually dating again. I have a performance coming up, my new date wanted to come with me. I was so happy. I told the guy who had stood me up in San fransisco about the show, it was near his house. We were still friends and he asked me to invite him to any shows of mine. He said he‚Äôd be there. I warned him I was dating a new guy. He didn‚Äôt show up. He got very weird after this and extremely clingy. Started begging me to visit him and wanting me to come over all the time. I told him I appreciated it but he had his chance. He so started sending an influx of weird sexual things/memes and it made me very uncomfortable. I asked him to stop and he had a tantrum saying he wasn‚Äôt trying to be disrespectful. 

ANYWAYS to the main part of the story + the obsession part of it: a few months after I told him he‚Äôs had his chance, I hadn‚Äôt heard from him in awhile which I didn‚Äôt mind because I told him I needed space. He texted me one night saying he‚Äôd been dating someone. I was genuinely happy for him because I was now in a serious relationship, which I‚Äôm still in (and very happy with), and maybe he‚Äôd finally stop being so weird and clingy. 

A few months later he texted me they‚Äôd moved in together. And a month later they were engaged. It was moving really quickly, I was kind of worried for him almost but he seemed happy so I was supportive. He told me he made a Facebook acct and wanted to add me, so I thought sure. But ever since I‚Äôve added him, all I see if posts of him and his fianc√©e who have been dating for way less than me and my serious boyfriend of 2 1/2 years, and they look really happy. And again‚Ä¶I‚Äôm happy for him. But I can‚Äôt keep obsessing over how mad I am that I feel betrayed. He dragged me along for like 3-4 years and kept leading me on instead of being honest with me, then had the nerve to get upset with me when I told him I had enough of being dragged along and stood up, and then he gets engaged within like 6 months of knowing this new girl. I obsess over it so much because it makes me mad and I want to still be his friend, but tell him about how hurt and betrayed I feel by him. And to just hear an honest apology, and then we can go back to being normal friends. Is this kind of obsession normal with ocd? I have horrible looping thoughts about it and it really gets to me. So sorry for such a long post‚Ä¶I really had to get it out and ask if this is normal. I‚Äôve been hung up in it for hours today and most days I get hung up on it for 20 mins or more, on snd off.

ttvgqh,"Anyone else thought that their obsessive thoughts was ~just~ severe anxiety? To preface, I have not been formally diagnosed with OCD and this insight is honestly just a way of me trying to figure out me and how my brain works for me. Ik a diagnosis helps a lot of people but for me this is less about a diagnosis and more about just insight, so please dont focus on that part.

Anyways, I've been doing a lot of reflection on this the past few days (as honestly im sure everyone can relate to). But I've slowly been realizing that the obsessive thoughts I've had since a teenager could actually be more related to OCD than to anxiety (but im sure everything is related as well lol). The main ones were relationship related, so I would always have the thought that the people I was talking to, dating, relationship were always cheating/ with somebody else when I was not with them/they were not responding immediately. This would cause me to obsessively check social medias hourly and internally freak out/anxiety until I saw new ""last seen"" on social media activity  or like if it showed they were active on FB desktop I would know that they were home and they couldn't be cheating or whatever.

This feeling would be the same for every relationship (and every part of the relationship) and would make me self sabotage so much or think I was crazy for literally not being able to not check their social medias. I had to literally block social medias on all my devices and would still look for ways to just get a quick check on them because I would find myself on autopilot checking these things. I also have ADHD, which also fueled into this more im sure with dopamine clicks.

the thing is I never thought of this feeling as a ""thought"" more just a feeling I am feeling in the moment and not even thinking it was a possibility that I didnt have to think this way. 

I also tend to google everything until I find someone who is able to relate to me like anecdotally and after I have researched/looked into everything I can about a certain health thing or whatever is giving me anxiety. I never really thought of this as OCD, but researching lately, I've seen that people can use google as their compulsion which honestly hits so close to home to me.

tuaru0,"Does this sound like OCD? I don't have the option to go to a doctor right now and I feel like I'm going crazy. So this will probably just be a rambling of things and I'm sorry.

I don't have the option to go to a doctor for a couple months. 

I've been dealing with a lot of these issues for as long as I can remember. I have always thought that a lot of these things were normal and everyone had thoughts and feelings like this so I never seemed any kind of help. It wasn't until recently that I started noticing that my things may not be the norm. 

I have dealt with intrusive thoughts since I was very young. I remember when I was like 6 years old saying like 5 different prayers every night exactly the same way or I felt something bad was going to happen, like the world was going to end or something. I was also always *very* aware of how germs a grime felt on me. I would wash my hands until they were cracking and bleeding even at a very young age. I never felt like I got the grossness off of me so I'd wash them again until it finally ""felt right"". I have never been a ""clean person"" like I am messy and also have a bit of a hoarding tendency. So it's not like how OCD is portrayed in movies with that stuff. Just with the hand washing. As I've gotten older I've continued a lot of those things. It's never been like a ""this just happens thing"". It's like I almost ""give myself"" new rules to follow. Like, one day I seen an animal that was hit on the road and I was sad and I just thought in my head ""pray for it or it will go to hell"" and now I have to pray for every animal, piece of trash, wood or anything I see on the side of the road or I feel like I will send it to hell. It has progressed to me feeling like I have to say my prayer (same prayer everytime) ""right"" or I have to repeat it until I do. There are never any set numbers for things like what I see in movies. It's never ""flick this light switch 3 times"" or ""touch the doorknob 5 times"" it's just until it ""feels right"" that could be 1 time or 15 times. It doesn't matter and my bad thoughts and feelings don't go away until I do it. I'm relieved every time I finish the task. The praying for animals thing has started to affect my being able to drive. I always feel so distracted. When I'm in the passenger seats I can usually close my eyes or not look at the road and I don't have to do my thing, but while driving I *have* to look at the road. It's very tiring. I have recently in the past few weeks picked up another ""thing"". My gate in my house broke so now I feel I need it to click just right before it's closed and if it doesn't close after one person uses it something bad is going to happen. I don't know what, it's just I feel like something is going to happen. I don't know. 

I always just assumed that what I did was normal. I still don't know for sure if it isn't normal. I opened up a bit about my stuff to someone not too long ago and they told me that these things weren't normal. At first I assumed maybe an anxiety thing, but I looked around on the internet (I know that's not a reliable source) and feel like some of my ""things"" line up with OCD. I really don't know and I hope that none of this comes off as offensive, I'm just so tired of living like this. It is so draining and I just don't know what to do. It feels like it keeps getting worse as I just keep creating new rules for myself. I swear I don't mean to keep torturing myself with these things. I try so hard to not think. It just doesn't work, my mind goes a million miles a minute and I can't stop every thought. I'm just tired. I'm sorry. 

I'm sorry for the long post. I don't really have anyone I talk to about this stuff so a lot of this is just getting off my chest.",9,5,2022-04-02 00:49:27-04:00,sound like ocd dont option go doctor right feel like im go crazi probabl rambl thing im sorri dont option go doctor coupl month ive deal lot issu long rememb alway thought lot thing normal everyon thought feel like never seem kind help wasnt recent start notic thing may norm dealt intrus thought sinc young rememb like year old say like differ prayer everi night exactli way felt someth bad go happen like world go end someth also alway awar germ grime felt would wash hand crack bleed even young age never felt like got gross id wash final felt right never clean person like messi also bit hoard tendenc like ocd portray movi stuff hand wash ive gotten old ive continu lot thing never like happen thing like almost give new rule follow like one day seen anim hit road sad thought head pray go hell pray everi anim piec trash wood anyth see side road feel like send hell progress feel like say prayer prayer everytim right repeat never set number thing like see movi never flick light switch time touch doorknob time feel right could time time doesnt matter bad thought feel dont go away im reliev everi time finish task pray anim thing start affect abl drive alway feel distract im passeng seat usual close eye look road dont thing drive look road tire recent past week pick anoth thing gate hous broke feel need click right close doesnt close one person use someth bad go happen dont know feel like someth go happen dont know alway assum normal still dont know sure isnt normal open bit stuff someon long ago told thing werent normal first assum mayb anxieti thing look around internet know that reliabl sourc feel like thing line ocd realli dont know hope none come offens im tire live like drain dont know feel like keep get wors keep creat new rule swear dont mean keep tortur thing tri hard think doesnt work mind goe million mile minut cant stop everi thought im tire im sorri im sorri long post dont realli anyon talk stuff lot get chest,"Sentiment(polarity=0.025004272043745734, subjectivity=0.5194487164881901)",0.025004272043745734,nuetral

I got discharged and told to go to a cardiologist with a peace of paper that just says paroxysmal tachycardia done another ecg and echo a week later both perfectly fine 
Done a 24 hour halter monitor another week later 
Which was fine minus a few pvc and pac 
Which doctors said wasn‚Äôt very much at all 
Was diagnosed with pots done a tilt table test and cardiologist didn‚Äôt mention any other conditions 
I have done 6-7 ecgs in the last year all 
Fine an echocardiogram 
coming back fine 
I have pots so everyone I stand up I get tachycardia which scares me thinking I‚Äôm gonna die from an arrhythmia and strong palpitations  so I lay back down and I‚Äôm basically  bed ridden in fear 
When I breath in  and out my heart speed changes and skips a beat then has a thud after it doesn‚Äôt happen all the time but happens sometimes 

Heart palpitations often 
Heart feels like it briefly pauses between breaths 

Heart rate feels irregular the gaps between each beat feels uneven even when I hold
My breath (thought was sinus arrhythmia) some
Times I‚Äôll get a few beats that have small gaps between then a few that have bigger gaps and so on

Only
On mothers side her 3 brothers all have had heart attacks from late 30s onwards ones had 1 other two have had multiple 
All alive 
But her father died from a heart attack at 47 (according to family member it‚Äôs was his second heart attack and  clogged arteries) 

When I stand up to get out of bed heart becomes rapid with intervals of slow heart thumps then back to rapid

tuhs8x,"sertraline for ocd i've had ocd most of my life but have massive flare ups triggered by stress which usually don't go away without CBT. 

since february, i've had the worst ocd i've ever had in my entire life (again triggered by stress). it has prevented me from going to school, contacting friends, going out in public etc. it has completely taken over my life and is so draining to the point where i've thought of giving up completely.

i've started seeing a private therapist (who i've only seen twice) which i'm hoping will help to manage or hopefully even cure the OCD. she has said to me that i have one of the most severe cases she's ever seen so it may not be fully curable. 

because it's so severe, my GP (through the recommendation of my therapist) has prescribed sertraline to help with OCD and also the low mood. 

one of the massive obsessions for my OCD in the first place is fear of being sick, and - after probably looking into the side effects too much - sertraline has that as one very common side effect (along with others that completely terrify me). i just don't know what to do, because i know that the medication could potentially help me so much, but i don't want to put myself at risk of the side effects no matter how rare they are.

TW// another major side effect for me is anorexia and suicidal ideation/attempts. after struggling with an eating disorder and a suicide attempt through my childhood/early teens, it scares me a lot to put myself at risk of that again just to help my OCD, when i haven't even tried CBT and exposure for very long anyway. 

i've briefly discussed my concern for the side effects to my family, friends and therapist who all tell me 'no pressure' and 'i'm not going to make you do anything you don't want to do' but then all say i 'really should take them' and that they 'strongly advise me to think otherwise' when i tell them i want to try CBT for a bit longer to see the effects and then reconsider the medication. 

i would really appreciate some advice and maybe some people that have taken sertraline in the past or currently to reply.

tu5i2w,"I have a ""theory"" about the root cause of OCD. As a kid I was made to feel guilty for everything. I'd feel ashamed and fearful when I fell off my bike as a kid once because I feared I'd get scolded, blamed and made to feel guilty as always. Mom had a way of reacting (insane and dramatic overreacting) that just made you feel like shit (guilty) over simplest shit, like you were a horrible person that did something horrible. 

Now, I tell you this because OCD sufferers are known to be guilt aversive. Read on it, a lot of the fears can revolve around guilt avoidance or what doing/believing x means about your character (internalizing.)

So what if I face the root emotion of guilt? Or deliberately make controlled mistakes just to get confortable with it? 

2nd part: I think we cognitively internalize most negative emotions as well. Sad becomes hopeless, guilt becomes I am evil, contamination OCD makes you feel disgusting? It's always internalized but why do we do that? Maybe our mistakes, which also mean guilt, came back to us as ""you're useless, dramatic, clumsy"" and labels like that?

So could it be caused by a specific upbringing where mistakes of any kind caused you immense guilt because you were led to believe (in any shape or form) it meant you were bad or defective?

tuces7,"I don't know what to do : It's been 3-4 weeks and in those three week my enthusiasm of doing anything have just died sometimes I just straight up don't brush my teeth for 3-4 days , take bath once in a week , have barely even written a single word for 2 papers that I've to submit for my master's degree while knowing that 20 marks depends on those paper and to do PhD I've to have some strong research work in my field , made a presentation based on my assignment but couldn't present it properly infront of class , I barely have talked with anyone in these weeks , I always want to be either left alone or just be in deep slumber and do nothing. 



3-4 weeks ago I had fight with my father regarding hostel/dorm room allotment regarding my master's degree because list haven't come out yet and he started telling me how online classes or work are done despite me telling him every classes and work are managed by different professors separately on that he started cussing me and I cussed back and he said that he don't want me to countinue my education because he can't afford it ( it's not a first time he said so when I was still in middle school and whenever I used to perform bad in study he used to say that he would make me beg on street if I didn't performed well or would not let me continue my education, during my highschool exams instead of wishing me good luck he used to say that he doesn't have much expectations from me because he knows that I'll end up disappointing him ) I don't know what it is but since that day I've finally given up on my family I don't want to do anything , I've given up on doing PhD or any of my dream. My mom whenever my father says anything bad to me she tells me that don't give attention to anything he says she have always been like this she never says anything to my father that he shouldn't have said that and it's not right thing to say to your son or anything , whenever I ask her how does she feels when my father cuss her she says she have learnt to ignore it ( not to mention my father just to beat her when I was kid and one time tried to kill her choking her throat ) my mom's only excuse to anything that my father do is to say it's too late to change him instead we should change ourselves or like your father won't understand anything because he struggled throughout his life while growing up , I don't know why she haven't ever thought of divorcing him or filling any charges ( maybe because it's India so women tolerate every shit that men do to them )



 I want to move away from my family and leave everything behind and start a new life but I can't because I don't have necessary skills to survive in open world or don't know anything beside studying history. I know when I'll move to my dorm later in this month or in May then maybe I'll have some peace but still I would be heavily dependent on my father for money until I get PhD and start getting stipend , I can't work anywhere because it's not allowed to take any job while living in hostel and can't afford to live outside university campus because it's very expensive. 



I just don't know how to pull myself up and start with the same enthusiasm I had 3 weeks before where I was ready to publish amazing papers , wanted to score good marks and wished to get PhD in my first try. Help me , tell me what to do and tell me how to get back to normal , I'm still on my OCD meds last 3 months , therapy have completed a month ago and these things are happening again , I'm just loosing my hope and everything is just crumbling down infront of my eyes , please help ( if someone reading this is Indian and know how to deal with it in Indian perspective it would be even better ).

tueyy1,"I think I may have developed OCD by being over-ambitious Ok, sorry in advance for any grammar mistakes. English is not my first language.
I know asking Reddit for medical advice isn't the smartest thing to do, but I've noticed a lot of symptoms similar to OCD, and I'm not sure what to do about it. I'm 17 yo (f). It's my second year of high school. My school is considered very prestigious. Since I have been attending there, my grades were getting worse each passing month. My parents always considered me an ""outstanding"" child and I can see that they do not like the fact that their dilutions are being crushed. I take maths, physics, and occasional english extra classes. I love drawing, but lately school has been taking all my free time away from me. And this is where it all started ...
I started noticing my odd behaviors:

-  Obsessively checking Facebook, Instagram and Messenger 4 times a day. Not because I'm addicted. I rarely post anything. I am just really afraid that by accident I will share or post something embarrassing and all my friends and teachers, who are following me there, will make fun of me. I am so scared that someone may take pictures of me and upload them to the Internet that I have a sticker on my phone's front camera to make sure no one is watching me. Also when I change my clothes, I leave my phone in another room. It makes me feel like I am the one in control. But on the other hand, it is very exhausting. All these ""rituals"" that I feel compelled to do every day, so that my brain finally encodes the message that ""everything is fine"", that ""I haven't shared anything"", and that ""no one has hacked my account"".

- I check if front doors are closed, multiple times, before I go to sleep. Every time I want to go to my room, I get the feeling that I haven't checked the door properly, so I come back and check it again, just to make sure. Sometimes this process takes 20 minutes until I'm satisfied and sure the door is closed.

- I imagine myself doing bad things a lot. It is nothing extreme for most of the time. Sometimes I imagine myself being very rude to people, for stupid reasons. It's kinda like having thousands of ""what-if"" scenarios in my head, that I need to prevent from happening. For example, when I am walking down the street and I see a person passing by, I often have thoughts like:
""What if I push this person to fall onto the sidewalk?""
""What if I tell them something mean?""
Then I wonder for half a day if I really did something to this person or if it all happened only in my head.

I had a mini breakdown this morning just ruminating on everything that's been going on with me mentally. The events that occurred during lockdown have made me really afraid of getting harmed in some way (murder, sexual harassment/assault, r\*pe, kidnapping, hate crime, etc.), and over the last few months, it's gotten to the point where I struggle even leaving the house unless I need to for school. I didn't really consider that I had OCD since I didn't have any 'obvious' compulsions until I realized that avoidance is very much a compulsion.

Last summer when things were opening up again for a bit, I got to meet some friends I made over the school year in person. It's been great, but it's been a struggle to meet them since I have driving anxiety and most of our hangouts are in places I've never driven to before. Hanging out with them and traveling around made me realize how much the world has to offer and I want to do so much more, but my brain keeps collecting reasons why I shouldn't, or if I do it, I'll regret it because something bad will happen to me. I recently skipped going to the city with my friends to this exhibit I really wanted to go to because the city=unsafe and night=unsafe. Looking back, I realize how irrational it was since we would've been together as a group inside a secured building. I don't want to get left behind because I can't leave my house.

tu4fgo,"are these traits from childhood? tw: mention of violent/sexual thoughts Hi there! I'm sure you get these posts alot, but i have a couple of habits i had as a kid and i was wondering if they tied into ocd? Im on a waiting list for an autism diagnosis atm:) 

Tw: mention of violent/sexual thoughts 
As a young child (about 7-8?) I had this compulsion to tell my mum that i fancied men on tv, and i had to say it the same way every time or i would get really anxious. I even called her when she was on holiday to tell her. I also used to get images of me and family members in the bath together stuck in my head. 
As an adult i do get intrusive sexual/violent thoughts that really upset me, but i dont have any compulsions that come along with that.

tu7kys,"Is this OCD? I‚Äôm suspected OCD. My therapist is leaning towards that, but is doing research because it doesn‚Äôt present as ‚Äútypical‚Äù OCD.

I don‚Äôt see her again till next week, but I‚Äôve written down a lot of the symptoms I‚Äôve noticed Over the years and I guess I never thought I had OCD till lately.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Preoccupied and obsessed with something bad happening to me. Or getting an illness that will kill me. Has been reoccurring for at least a decade . 

If I have a panic attack,  I repeat my address or my SSN in my head to make sure my memory is still okay. 
If I can complete it, that means I‚Äôm okay. 

I go over every ‚Äúsymptom‚Äù I feel , over and over, making sure it‚Äôs not dangerous and I‚Äôm safe. I can‚Äôt focus on anything else and it becomes a constant thought or worry that I can‚Äôt shake. 

Worrying my house will burn down if the lights are on without me there 

Won‚Äôt drink a drink if I feel it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot right‚Äù and if the lid is unscrewed when I get it, I won‚Äôt touch it. I taste test it to make sure it‚Äôs safe.

Tasting to see if drinks (that have been handed to me) are safe. If the water doesn‚Äôt taste right I won‚Äôt drink it. 

Unable to leave the house if I feel like it‚Äôs not safe to leave.

Asking family for reassurance 
If I‚Äôm really ‚Äúokay ‚Äú and if they‚Äôre sure that I‚Äôm not dying or ill . Will do this as many times as I need to , to feel okay. 

Feeling anxious if the tasks I feel need done, don‚Äôt get done.
Even if it‚Äôs only making my closet symmetrical. 
 
If I don‚Äôt stick to my routine something bad will happen. 
If I don‚Äôt stop on the number that ‚Äúfeels okay‚Äù when pumping gas, I have to keep going until it is. It has to feel right. 

When buying medication, I have to look 3 or more times to make sure it‚Äôs the right one. To make sure it‚Äôs not the sleepy kind. I just have to make sure. 

If someone hands me a pill, I have to Google it to make sure it‚Äôs the right one because not knowing will send me into panic. And I re-examine and re-examine and will ask to see the bottle it came from. 

If a room doesn‚Äôt look right I will reorganize, move furniture, do anything I can until it does.
if anything doesn‚Äôt look right I will do whatever I can to fix it or else I can‚Äôt move forward. 

Medication bottles cannot be stored next to where I sleep. Or else I will worry that I have taken all of them and will end up dying . Or I double check to make sure there‚Äôs no more than 1-2 in my hand when I take some. 

Things in cabinets must be label-facing. And put in the appropriate order. Cans with cans, in line with the same kind and so on. Clothes color coordinated and organized separately (t-shirts with t-shirts, stripes with stripes etc etc )

Worried the house will burn down while I sleep. 

Things must be put in the right spot in the shower, counters, and etc etc. I will spend quite a bit of time doing this until it‚Äôs satisfactory for me. 
Forward facing and the right way.
I will adjust and adjust. If it gets messed up, I will get upset and frustrated. 

I also do this with clothes.
If it doesn‚Äôt look ‚Äúright‚Äù I get very anxious and frustrated and have to fix it . 

If I do anything out of the order that I normally do it, I get anxious and it feels wrong. 

Even if I go to a different place to eat on my lunch break it feels wrong and feels like something bad will happen if I don‚Äôt stick to my routine . Have to get the same thing every time 

I fear that  if I say certain things I will be jinxing myself and what I say will come true and if I don‚Äôt say it, that means it won‚Äôt come true. 

Making lists. Or writing things. I will re-do it and re-do it until it‚Äôs suitable. I can‚Äôt cross things out or else I have to toss the paper and re-write it 

If I said ‚Äúit‚Äôs gonna be a good day‚Äù i would be jinxing myself. Something bad would happen. 

Things have to be arranged just right . It‚Äôs like an itch in my brain that must be scratched. It has to be done .",2,1,2022-04-01 21:55:27-04:00,ocd i‚Äôm suspect ocd therapist lean toward research doesn‚Äôt present ‚Äútypical‚Äù ocd don‚Äôt see till next week i‚Äôv written lot symptom i‚Äôv notic year guess never thought ocd till late ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî preoccupi obsess someth bad happen get ill kill reoccur least decad panic attack repeat address ssn head make sure memori still okay complet mean i‚Äôm okay go everi ‚Äúsymptom‚Äù feel make sure it‚Äô danger i‚Äôm safe can‚Äôt focu anyth els becom constant thought worri can‚Äôt shake worri hous burn light without won‚Äôt drink drink feel it‚Äô ‚Äúnot right‚Äù lid unscrew get won‚Äôt touch tast test make sure it‚Äô safe tast see drink hand safe water doesn‚Äôt tast right won‚Äôt drink unabl leav hous feel like it‚Äô safe leav ask famili reassur i‚Äôm realli ‚Äúokay ‚Äú they‚Äôr sure i‚Äôm die ill mani time need feel okay feel anxiou task feel need done don‚Äôt get done even it‚Äô make closet symmetr don‚Äôt stick routin someth bad happen don‚Äôt stop number ‚Äúfeel okay‚Äù pump ga keep go feel right buy medic look time make sure it‚Äô right one make sure it‚Äô sleepi kind make sure someon hand pill googl make sure it‚Äô right one know send panic reexamin reexamin ask see bottl came room doesn‚Äôt look right reorgan move furnitur anyth anyth doesn‚Äôt look right whatev fix els can‚Äôt move forward medic bottl cannot store next sleep els worri taken end die doubl check make sure there‚Äô hand take thing cabinet must labelfac put appropri order can can line kind cloth color coordin organ separ tshirt tshirt stripe stripe etc etc worri hous burn sleep thing must put right spot shower counter etc etc spend quit bit time it‚Äô satisfactori forward face right way adjust adjust get mess get upset frustrat also cloth doesn‚Äôt look ‚Äúright‚Äù get anxiou frustrat fix anyth order normal get anxiou feel wrong even go differ place eat lunch break feel wrong feel like someth bad happen don‚Äôt stick routin get thing everi time fear say certain thing jinx say come true don‚Äôt say mean won‚Äôt come true make list write thing redo redo it‚Äô suitabl can‚Äôt cross thing els toss paper rewrit said ‚Äúit‚Äô gonna good day‚Äù would jinx someth bad would happen thing arrang right it‚Äô like itch brain must scratch done,"Sentiment(polarity=0.1555697278911565, subjectivity=0.6047193877551019)",0.1555697278911565,positive

ttpddj,"Mental breakdown over furniture in a garage I just need to rant. I was supposed to have an appointment with my therapist on Tuesday but she has COVID, so I just need to be able to talk.

I have had OCD since I was about 11-12. I‚Äôm 30 now. It started with me not wanting to go to the farm of my grandparents because it smelled. When I did have to go, I would jump into the shower whenever I got home and have a breakdown if anyone came near me with farm clothes. It has had many forms over the year but here are some:

* I have to check my hair to make sure I rinse everything out (even though I know rationally that everything rinses out in like a minute). I divide my hair in three parts and I have to count to 10, then to 5, then to 3, then 1 in every part and I have to do that twice.
* I cannot wear a t-shirt more than once. I‚Äôve come so far that I can wear a sweater twice.
* I have to wash myself at least twice every day and apply deodorant at least 5 times a day.
* I always check everything before I leave: if I didn‚Äôt leave a window open, a tap running, an oven on. I make videos so that if I need reassurance during the day, I can watch that. I only check everything about 4 times. Used to be 2 but stress has been bad lately.
* I always check the door before I leave: 5 taps to the door frame, and then check 5 times, then 3 taps, then 3 checks, 1 tap, 1 check and then start from three again, and then one.
* When I go on vacation, I make my bag 5 days in advance, and I have to check at least 5 times if I have everything.
* When I make food, I have to wait 2 hours on the dot before I can put the leftovers in the fridge.
* I never eat food passed the experiation date.
* I have IBS, I check the back of my clothes everyday. I have been wearing a menstrual pad every day for the last 12 years because I‚Äôm afraid I will have an accident. Note: I have never had an accident in public. 
* When I don‚Äôt wear tights, I wear cut off tights, for the event I ever have an accident.
* I‚Äôm afraid every time I leave the house to get an IBS attack, which leads to an IBS attack, which leads to more anxiety and so on and so forth.
* I have many, many food intolerances, and the thought of someone cooking for me brings about so much anxiety that I just don‚Äôt let anyone ever cook for me.

So that are some of the things I do. I also have this thing about the garage at home. For years, I wasn‚Äôt able to enter it because I thought it smelled, now I‚Äôm able to just go in it (major accomplishment).

The last couple weeks have been rough for me: I had a burnout in February, bought an apartment in March, my father has to get an MRI tomorrow because of some unexplained pain in his legs and I think it‚Äôs cancer even though my mom says he probably overdid it with working. My mother just casually mentioned that they had put some furniture that I had ordered for the new apartment in the garage and I totally lost it. Started crying and feeling really down. Even though I know three things for sure: 1) the garage doesn‚Äôt smell 2) they‚Äôre in packages, we still have to assemble them so even if the garage did smell it would be in the packaging material 3) furniture can‚Äôt retain smell.

ttszl1,"How do you distinguish between obsessions and mental compulsions, and how do you deal with mental compulsions? I like to think my OCD condition is kinda weird. Obligatory trigger warning as I describe it below:

My main ‚Äúfear‚Äù that triggers the thoughts is that the thoughts themselves will ruin experiences that are enjoyable or important to me. This has come in all sorts of forms, like for example, triggering disgusting imagery during the high points of a show or movie I love.

Nowadays though, the thoughts have taken the form of intrusive earworms. And sometimes they come naturally, which makes it easier because I can just usually just accept them and disregard them. But other times, I get the urge to play a certain earworm within my brain during experiences. Since I‚Äôm already doing something else at the time, following the urge to play the earworm would involve conscious effort on my part, since I‚Äôd have to remember the actual earworm first and then make it play out in my head. 

After doing this and letting it play out, I usually get some relief (I assume because playing the earworm once tricks my brain into thinking it‚Äôs overcome the danger of my experience being ruined), which makes me think that it‚Äôs a mental compulsion. But if it is a mental compulsion, that would mean I should be trying to not let the earworm play out, which is really hard to control since it‚Äôs a thought. 

So my questions are, am I right in thinking that this earworm triggering is a mental compulsion, or is it instead an obsession that I should be letting play out every time I get the urge? And if it is a mental compulsion, what‚Äôs the proper way to deal with it?",0,2,2022-04-01 11:08:22-04:00,distinguish obsess mental compuls deal mental compuls like think ocd condit kinda weird obligatori trigger warn describ main ‚Äúfear‚Äù trigger thought thought ruin experi enjoy import come sort form like exampl trigger disgust imageri high point show movi love nowaday though thought taken form intrus earworm sometim come natur make easy usual accept disregard time get urg play certain earworm within brain experi sinc i‚Äôm alreadi someth els time follow urg play earworm would involv consciou effort part sinc i‚Äôd rememb actual earworm first make play head let play usual get relief assum play earworm trick brain think it‚Äô overcom danger experi ruin make think it‚Äô mental compuls mental compuls would mean tri let earworm play realli hard control sinc it‚Äô thought question right think earworm trigger mental compuls instead obsess let play everi time get urg mental compuls what‚Äô proper way deal,"Sentiment(polarity=0.009801587301587304, subjectivity=0.39887188208616775)",0.009801587301587304,nuetral
ttxf5r,"I have a huge fear I'm developing schizophrenia, can you please help? I'm losing my mind Hello, I'm a 23 years old female who lives in a country where unfortunately not many still belive in therapy (one being my dad) and I live with family.

About 2 years ago I developed intrusive thoughts which were diagnosed as harm ocd when I went to therapy, I also took pills for some time but I stopped taking them after about 5 or 6 months. I was totally and completely fine afterwards but about few weeks ago my intrusive thoughts were back, weaker, but there.

This time I changed my therapist and yesterday was my first session, she asked about how these thoughts started and I said once I heard a voice in my head telling me to kill my mom, and she said because I have heard a voice, I have developed psychosis symptoms which could lead into schizophrenia so its better if I meet a doctor and take pills but I'm only diagnosed harm ocd by now. She said if a schizophrenia patient who gets hospitalised is a 100 I'm at 22. After that I have been terrified, terribly terribly terrified. I keep thinking about every little action of mine and if  I'm being apart from reality. 

My father's family are known to have a lowkey paranoia which was never diagnosed because none of them belive in therapy. So I keep thinking what if I have all the genes needed??? 

Later last night I remembered I heard voices in my head when I was a kid, after a traumatic event. By searching in Google I found out its normal for kids.

And when I compare the beginning of my harm ocd with the voices in my head as a kid, I realised it wasn't a voice at all, it was just a loud thought and I had told the therapist a false info. 

I also told her I'm really terrified and unwell and she said she never said I'm schizophrenic or that  not even an emergency case, but its not calming me down at alllll

I'm panicking and terrified for life. What if it was in fact a voice??? What if I'm developing schizophrenia???

ttlkhc,"Existential Ocd/ intrusive thoughts Hi everyone. I‚Äôm writing this mainly to get my thoughts out there and to see if anyone else can relate in the slightest. 
At the beginning of the pandemic I had my first (that I can remember) episode of derealization. I‚Äôm not sure how but it eventually went away after a few weeks. Then I was okay for another 10-12 months and it came back for another month. Once again it went away and I don‚Äôt even remember how/why. 

This time it came back randomly and although the derealization feeling has gone away I‚Äôm stuck with the intrusive existential thoughts such as ‚ÄúHow do we exist?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat is existence/consciousness?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat is reality and all of this?‚Äù And I‚Äôll also catch myself being hyper aware of existing. It feels sort of hopeless and exhausting.
 It‚Äôs like it sends a quick panic/terror over me and I can almost feel pressure in my head. 

This time feels different than the past times because these thoughts are just staying in the back of my mind. It‚Äôs hard to imagine not having these thoughts in the future. Like i suddenly became aware of something and now I‚Äôll never be able to ignore it. ü•∫
I can‚Äôt even remember how I felt before these thoughts because my OCD has latched onto them and won‚Äôt let my mind rest. 

I know these are questions no one can have the answer to but that makes it worse for my mind because it can‚Äôt let it go. 
I‚Äôm currently looking for a psychiatrist but I don‚Äôt want them to be like ‚Äúoh you‚Äôre crazy‚Äù or whatever. Also I know medicine can help with the panic but will it help with the intrusive thoughts at all. Nothing can stop me from thinking about it but I‚Äôm hoping it can take away some of the obsession. 

Sorry for the absolute novel of text. If anyone has similar thoughts and medicine helped or anything helped I would love to hear about it. And if anyone read any of this thanks for taking the time.

Going to bed at night is the worst. Here are some thing I have to do over and over again before I can call asleep. They are very odd. I know. 

1. Make sure the hair on the side of my head is not in my ear, hanging over my ear, but tucked completely behind my ear. I cannot tell you how many times I get comfortable, and then quickly tuck my hair behind my ears for the 7th time that night. There‚Äôs no specific number I have to do this, I am just obsessive with it. 

2. I have to put my blanket in between my inner elbow. The technical term for this part of the body is the ‚ÄúCubital Fossa‚Äù if you aren‚Äôt sure what I mean. I do this because if my arm is bent, that means the skin on my arm is touching. It‚Äôs so hard to describe. So basically, I put a blanket in between my arm if it is bent while I‚Äôm sleeping. So that the skin does not stick together. So strange. Same thing with my arm pits. I don‚Äôt like my arm to be pressed to my side for these reasons. So I end up sleeping in like a robot position. 

3. I HAVE to crack my back, knuckles and toes before I sleep. I have to make sure they are all cracked before I can sleep. 

4. Lastly, I constantly have to run my eyes, because I CANNOT go to sleep with a little  crust in the corner of my eye, no eye boogers here. Absolutely not. I do this so many times a night that the corner of my eye literally hurts from trying to get imaginary crud out.

And this would even include random things, like if one of my fingers touched a different surface (like a door) I will have to do the same with all of my other fingers before I move on. As I've grown older this has gotten worse, 2020 was when it was at it's worst, I was obsessed with checking if the lights and taps are off in the washroom before I could sleep and it was so frustrating standing there in the middle of the night staring at the tap/light because I couldn't make myself believe that it was actually off. My mental health was also at it's lowest at this point and I would worry about bad things happening if I didn't check because it would be my fault (like it would be my fault that electricity or water was wasted over night if I did not check)

I still struggle with my mental health but it isn't as bad as it had been in 2020. I still have these habits and for the most part I can deal with them but the frustration comes with not being sure if it's OCD (or something more) or just some habits that I can break.

A lot of disorders and illnesses share similar or equal symptoms, and/or are followed by other disorders you can be missing. And things can go wrong easily.

You deserve to really know what is happening to you and do the correct treatment for you to be able to live your life as normal as possible.

Hugs for everyone!! Remember you can do this!!!

**EDIT:**

I am not saying to not look for information because if it was that none of us would be in this subr.

What I mean is that even if you have a guidance and research, at the end you need to talk about it to a professional to be sure that a disorder is really the one you think, to be sure it is not teaming with other disorders and for the best treatment for you.

The second time I come back, I must have been a little stressed because my heart rate was 105. To donate plasma, your BPM must be 100 or less. For anyone else, this is simple breathing and relaxation exercises after a few minutes. For me, I cannot stop thinking about my heart rate now. Every time I walk in, my heart rate is 130, and I am being disqualified every godd*** time. I just cannot get the thought of lowering my heart rate out of my head. 

They recommended getting a doctor‚Äôs note stating that I have an abnormally high BPM, and I‚Äôm like‚Ä¶ my BPM is 60. I‚Äôm healthier than everyone else donating in that facility. My problem is obsessive compulsive disorder. If my heart rate isn‚Äôt being measured, it‚Äôs fine. If it‚Äôs being measured, it‚Äôs extremely high. If I weren‚Äôt out hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of dollars, I really wouldn‚Äôt care‚Ä¶ but the fact that OCD is sabotaging me this much is incredibly infuriating.

My therapy so far has been focused on controlling my own actions. This I have been able to do after some years. But controlling my subconscious heart rate, which is completely automated, is proving to be extremely difficult. I have no clue what to do.",3,1,2022-04-01 09:20:31-04:00,frustrat today‚Ä¶ i‚Äôm somebodi deal ocd intrus thought repetit thought here‚Äô i‚Äôm littl bit frustrat say least i‚Äôv tri donat plasma pay well donat first time week ago success decid come back second time come back must littl stress heart rate donat plasma bpm must less anyon els simpl breath relax exercis minut cannot stop think heart rate everi time walk heart rate disqualifi everi godd time cannot get thought low heart rate head recommend get doctor‚Äô note state abnorm high bpm i‚Äôm like‚Ä¶ bpm i‚Äôm healthy everyon els donat facil problem obsess compuls disord heart rate isn‚Äôt measur it‚Äô fine it‚Äô measur it‚Äô extrem high weren‚Äôt hundr hundr hundr dollar realli wouldn‚Äôt care‚Ä¶ fact ocd sabotag much incred infuri therapi far focus control action abl year control subconsci heart rate complet autom prove extrem difficult clue,"Sentiment(polarity=0.07625000000000001, subjectivity=0.3425)",0.07625000000000001,positive

ttp6ng,"Is This OCD Guilt or Should I Feel Guilty? I started feeling unwell on Weds 16th March. I did an antigen that evening when I started to feel worse. It was negative. My friend, who I saw on Sunday 13th March, got a positive antigen test result on Thursday 17th March, so because I have an autoimmune disease and had seen her the previous Sunday and was supposed to be travelling the coming Monday, I went for a PCR test that day. I got the result on Friday 18th March. It was negative.

 I flew to England from Ireland on Mon 21st March, as I was moving here and had accommodation booked and I didn't want to wait until I felt better to come here. I started to feel pretty awful that day and subsequent days, so I wore a mask wherever I went, outdoors and indoors, and avoided people. Just went to shops to get food.

 My friend mentioned that I could still have Covid but maybe it didn't show up on the day I did the PCR. I thought about doing another antigen test but I didn't want to pay for one. It's 8 euro in Ireland and I didn't even bother to research how much it costs here. I have OCD around money.

 I didn't think too much about it. I thought because I had the PCR, I had done what I needed to do. And when I started to feel better on Monday and Tuesday this week, 28th and 29th March (12/13 days after I first started feeling unwell), I went to some shops the first day and a coffee shop the next. I still kept my distance from people and wore my mask indoors, except for at the coffee shop.

 Then after speaking to my sister on Wednesday of this week, 30th March, when she asked me if I had done another antigen test and I told her I hadn't because I didn't want to pay for it and she seemed to disapprove of that, I started to feel guilty that I hadn't done another one. I tried to get one yesterday, but the local pharmacies are all out because, I didn't realise, but yesterday was the last day you could get free tests here! 

Now I don't know what to do. I still have a cough and feel very tired, but I'm mostly over it. I don't want to waste a GPs time asking advice when it's all online and I don't want to go too far to find a pharmacy selling antigen tests, as I'm too tired to do anything and I don't want to be around too many people. 

I feel really guilty about being too scabby and selfish to do another antigen test. I don't know what came over me. I've asked for the universe's forgiveness. But I don't seem to be able to forgive myself. I need to study for a job interview on Monday, but I'm immobilised. I can't get past this. Also, Covid related stuff is hard for me to judge, as I've been hospitaised for really bad germ stuff before, so now I try not to let myself get to the point where I'm over cautious with Covid. 

I guess I'm looking for reassurance here. But also any tips on how to get past guilt. I think guilt in this situation is necessary, but I don't want it to consume me, as I need to study for this interview. I need this job so I can pay for therapy and become a better version of myself.

tti0l9,"Famous last words: ‚ÄúAt least I don‚Äôt have [other OCD subtype]!‚Äù In late 2019, I cut a friendship off due to power imbalance in my favor. I was a few years older and it didn‚Äôt sit right with me at all. I was a teenager, but was in this weird role of responsibility that I just wasnt equipped to handle. There were anger problems on the friend‚Äôs side, but after the things they‚Äôd went through I understand. (Basically, I should have known I‚Äôm not a therapist.)

For months I had intense, unmanageable OCD about having ended the friendship, obsessing over the theme of being an irresponsible, awful, abandoning, ‚Äòbad friend‚Äô, whether I was manipulative or not, dark triad quizzes, the works. The whole time this was going on though, I said to myself: ‚Äúat least I don‚Äôt have pOCD!‚Äù I said this because it felt like an extreme, a belief that I would never develop in the same way that an OCD sufferer who doesnt drive isn‚Äôt gonna have OCD about committing a hit and run.

Six months later, guess what happens: I can‚Äôt remember the events anymore, nor remember what I said, and so the memory gets replaced with an intrusive thought: ‚Äúwhat if it was something _really bad_ you said? What if it was sexual?‚Äù 

Considering that kind of thing makes _me_ uncomfortable, I know I wouldn‚Äôt have said those things. But that doesnt stop OCD tormenting me with the idea I‚Äôm the worst type of person on the planet. It‚Äôs made me sick before. How did it get to this? I started off knowing full well, and with self-awareness, that I had OCD.

So a few months back my friends and i were at this house party and some were drunk and some of us (me included) weren't. Now this girl was semi drunk i guess. We were playing truth and dare and we dared her to kiss this guy on his cheek. We always have been teasing them for fun. The girl was down but the guy seemed hesitant. We kept forcing him and he finally budged cus he felt bad for her. She gave him a peck on the cheek. Yesterday i was on call with him (he is my bestfriend) and we were talking about the party and he said we peer pressurized him. I felt horrible and apologized profusely. He said it was okay and it was just a peck on the cheek so no big deal. But still. I feel like we were stupid considering we were sober. (He was also sober).

ttiz15,"Unhealthy Attachment to Pets? Concerning behavior... how to help? Hi everyone. This is a bit of a weird post and definitely a long story, but I really need some help supporting someone in my life. My (20F) family--my mom, dad, and 16 yo brother--just recently decided to foster a dog. They had the intention of adopting her if it was a good fit. However, she is not potty trained, has lots of physical ability issues, and we have another dog who is having a lot of trouble transitioning to having her there. In short, it isn't a great fit and most of us believe it's best to offer her the opportunity to be adopted by another family. 

However, my dad has become attached to her to a borderline unhealthy degree. This situation has literally sacrificed my parents' marriage and now they are considering divorce because he is willing to choose this dog and adopting her over my mom. (He didn't say this verbatim or in a mean way, but that is what's been implied.) I know it sounds dramatic, and it is, and that's why I am concerned. He's always had a very strong attachment to animals but this is unlike anything we could've expected. He's been sobbing all day at the prospect of giving her up, and my mom said this is the saddest she's ever seen him (and he's lost 2 brothers, both his parents, and many friends). 

I do not judge him, but instead I am concerned. I have OCD, which I believe I inherited from him--even though he has never been formally diagnosed, I've seen him exhibit tendencies of it my whole life. I am worried for his mental health and I know from my own obsessions that this can easily spiral out of control and become catastrophic. I also believe that there is other trauma that may be underlying this. He lost his dad and brothers from a very young age, grew up poor, has always been a lost soul, is perpetually unhappy, etc. 

I guess I don't know what I am hoping to get out of this post other than some support and maybe advice. Has anyone else been through this or witnessed someone go through this (namely, the severe attachment to pets or even to something else)? How did you help them through it? I'm worried his mental health will deteriorate or that he will even become suicidal if he has to give her up. On the other hand, we cannot keep her. It's very complicated and I just want to help him heal through whatever is causing this. If anyone has light to shed, it would be greatly appreciated.

Everywhere I go, I'm running into scenarios that are dirty, disgusting, and/or potentially harmful, and it's been driving me crazy. It seems like every day, I'm stressing over something.  My partner will do stuff like try to cook expired seafood or meat. I know people that don't wash their hands after using the washroom. Pretty much any time I go to someone's house, there's residue/dirt left on cutlery or glasses. If I go to a fast-food place, I see the workers touching food with their bare hands or doing other weird shit. My last workplace had a pest infestation and all the other employees just kept eating the food.  

Today I went to a barber to get my hair trimmed and I started to realize during that I don't think she disinfected any of the clippers or razors. She said she did but I don't see any of the materials to do so, and now I'm stressed about getting some disease. But I look up the place and it has rave reviews. I feel like I'm living in some Bizarro world. 

I feel like I'm going insane because everywhere I go, I'm running into scenarios that trigger my contamination OCD but I actually think I'm justified to be disgusted and fearful of them.

ttkglf,"Does this sound like OCD? Hi everyone, so I haven‚Äôt been formally diagnosed with OCD, though my psychiatrist seems to believe I may have it. I initially shot down my psychiatrist‚Äôs comment because I assumed OCD only manifested as it‚Äôs stereotype (Things always have to be organized, excessive hand-washing, etc). But after doing more research on OCD, I‚Äôm realizing that some of my behaviors as a child, and even into today, may be reminiscent of OCD, and I was wondering if anyone here could tell me if these behaviors sound like OCD or if i‚Äôm just being paranoid.

Firstly, ever since I began potty training as a child, I have always had a very strict bathroom ritual. Whenever I would go to the restroom to poop, I always had to do three things: I had to get completely naked, I had to put two squares of toilet paper on the back of the toilet seat (I did this to cover the little gap that exists where the toilet seat and lid meet because I was scared spiders would crawl out of the space and bite me if I didn‚Äôt), and I had sit on the toilet with my feet on the seat in a squatting position while balancing myself by holding the sides of the seat with my hands. I know this likely sounds somewhat ridiculous, but I found myself physically unable to relieve myself unless I followed all three of these steps. As I got older (I‚Äôm now in my 20s) I found myself slowly growing out of the need to strictly follow these rules, but I still haven‚Äôt been able to completely shake them. As an adult, I no longer feel the need to put the two squares of toilet paper on the back of the toilet seat, but I still find that I am unable relieve myself without completely undressing. I was able to eventually stop squatting with my feet on the toilet seat, but I still am not able to relieve myself while normally sitting on the toilet ‚Äî instead I now find that I can only relax enough to poop if I am holding myself over the toilet with my butt hovering above the bowl (basically imagine sitting in the normal #2 position and then grabbing the sides of the toilet to lift your butt above the toilet).

The second quirk about myself that I was wondering about regards writing essays. I am unable to write essays in Google docs or word because it feels permanent and like a space that must be perfect. As a consequence of this, I find I‚Äôm only able to draft my essays in my notes app, because it feels less permanent and like the words I write are less consequential. I cannot physically bring myself to write an essay in docs or word, I have to finish it it notes app and then transfer the final product when it‚Äôs finally perfect enough to be in docs/word.

I also used to do this thing when my parents would go leave me at the house and run errands as a child, that I‚Äôm unsure is actually OCD or just anxiety. Every time my parents would leave the house to run an errand, I would have to watch them drive away and would have to bow my head and pray to God that they had a safe drive. I feared that not doing this might somehow cause them to get into a car accident. This went on for a few years but I did eventually grow out of it, which leads me to believe I may have just grown less anxious about the situation with age.

tt8g12,"I am struggling doing bad habits ""perfectly, one last time"" (just right OCD) As the title says, I've been having difficulty quitting bad habits. I cut out all junk food from my diet as well as alcohol and pornography. I've lost 10 pounds in the last two months and have 15 more to go. However, I'm stuck in a thought loop of telling myself that I haven't engaged in those bad habits ""correctly"" the last time I did them.

&#x200B;

For example, the last time I had alcohol was at my friend's wedding in October, and I had two sweet alcoholic drinks. This feels wrong to me because in my mind it should have been a beer, the standard alcoholic drink, during a regular day of the week. This has been circling in my mind since I had alcohol back in October. 

&#x200B;

I guess I could have a beer to make things ""just right"" but I am on medications and I'm not supposed to drink alcohol. I also have the same obsession with taking medications, I feel like the day I started taking medications was not the ""right day"" to start and that I should've waited until a different time to start.

&#x200B;

I also have the same thoughts with junk food. Chips, ice cream, soda, pastries. I keep thinking about how I should've had a bit of a ceremony about the last time I had these items to mark the event instead of just randomly cutting them out of my life. The same can be said about quitting pornography as well - I keep feeling like the last time I used it it wasn't ""just right"" and that I need to do it one last time perfectly.

&#x200B;

Does anyone have any suggestions about how I can get rid of these thoughts? I've talked to therapists about this before and it hasn't seemed to help. I honestly can't sleep most nights because of the thoughts that something feels ""off"". I'm losing hope, life is incredibly difficult most days because I can't get these thoughts out of my mind.

ttfcjt,"Worried that I'll be accused of stealing I'm honestly in so much mental anguish right now. I want it to stop

Today at my college, I was looking for a charging cable at one of the campus stores. I rummaged through the bin of cables they had for sale to see if they had the type of cable I needed. They didn't, so I walked out of the store empty handed.

Now, I always feel kind of nervous leaving stores without having bought anything, because I'm worried that they employees might think I stole something. To make matters worse, as I walked by the cashiers, I realized my hand was in my pocket, which probably made me look suspicious. So from their perspective,I walked around for a minute, I rummaged through the cables, and then walked out without buying anything with my hand in my pocket. They probably thought I stole.

I've literally been obsessing about this all day. Replaying the scenario over and over. I even went back to that store to ask the cashier directly if they had a charging cable, just to try and make myself feel better. Didn't work.

tt3of6,"Returning to Reddit as Exposure Therapy I created this account today which is the reason for the low karma count. 

There was a suspicion that I had OCD since I was as young as 8 and I got a formal diagnosis at around 19. Even though I had an official diagnosis from a mental health professional, I never believed it and I never realized that I didn't believe it. I thought that all of my OCD symptoms were character flaws, bad habits, a lot of personal weakness, and that I must be super needy and want attention so I fake symptoms. I figured that if a doctor said if I have OCD then I must, but it also must not be that big of a deal or as bad as people say because my OCD doesn't bother me, I just hate who I am and all the weird things I do (supposedly) for sympathy and/or attention. 

I'm now 32 and had a really bad obsessive episode a month and a half to two months ago, for which I'm currently on leave at work and working with a therapist on a daily basis. I'm not sure what happened, but sometime in the last week or two, I finally understood that OCD is a part of me, but it's not me, it isn't who I am. OCD is like some malignant parasite that attached itself to my brain so it can feed me obsessive thoughts and feed on my mental and emotional pain. Along with that understanding, I finally *believed* that I have OCD. For the first time in my life I was able to look back on so many of the things I did growing up that made me feel like a freak, made me feel like I have no self control, and generally made me feel ashamed of myself and extremely self conscious. I was also able to feel sorry for myself rather than beat myself up and shame and punish myself for having an illness. I took two days off of work just so I could process and cry thinking of how I felt almost every day for my entire life the, and I cried the same way that I would have for anyone else who had to go through that. Nobody deserves that

In 2020 I was struggling really badly with my OCD but I didn't realize it was OCD at the time, I just knew I was suffering and wanted to reach out to anyone for support. I joined reddit to find communities like this one and...let's be honest, a lot of reddit can be needlessly toxic and unkind. I had been the target of what I felt to be some extremely unfair attacks and attempts to smear my character because of untrue assumptions about me. Reddit quickly became a trigger for me and I could spend hours or days just ruminating on it and getting more and more obsessive and upset the longer I thought about the situation, knowing that I would never be able to ""control"" or ""fix"" or ""solve"" this. Instead, I developed a very strong avoidance compulsion toward reddit and basically all social media except YouTube

I'm very uncomfortable being on this platform right now and writing all of this out. I feel like an abused dog slowly approaching with his hackles raised, fully expecting to get kicked and screamed at and shamed again.

ttc8f4,"No Anxiety, but Shame I'm an educator and have had a lot of anxiety this year around being reprimanded or let go.  I went into therapy at 50 for anger issues, after an incident at work, and came out with my OCD diagonals.  I use anger to control.  Whenever I slip back to anger I obsess over the incident and wait for the shoe to drop.  Most of the time, I actually obsess over a minor incident and fear it is the end.  I don't sleep and check my email constantly waiting for the call into my admin's office.

Last night was more of the same.  I did my mental exercises to exercise the ruminations.  I am big into restorative justice, wanting to sit down, make amends and move forward.  As I thought how i might do that when I got to school, I realized two things.  1. I am not feeling anxiety as much as I'm feeling shame.  What I really want to do is go back in time and no do the thing, but since I can't I want to undo the consequences for the other person.  2. Our society is not made for forgiveness, but punishment.  I was nearly fired 15 years ago because I went into the meeting, owned my actions and my union rep said it would be a simple probation while I got better at my job.  Nope, they tried to fire me.  My colleague lawyered up and denied everything and they just dismissed her issue.  So, I'm afraid of what I may have done and of trying to make things right as an admission.

Thanks to therapy and a diagnosis, I have most everything under control.

tteilu,"Scared my food has been tampered with [COCD] This is the second time this week that I've suspected my food has been tampered with. I brought some quacker oats a while ago which come in small paper packets inside a cardboard box. One of the paper packets had split at the corner and spilled oats onto the bottom of the box. At first I thought nothing of it, other than to avoid that using that packet as it's probably got dirty. But now having ate several packets over the past few days, I've become increasingly concerned that the split packet is evidence that my food has been tampered with. Maybe someone opened the box in the shop, split the packet, and injected some sort of poison into the food. Maybe in the other sealed packets they were more tactful with it, so it was only one that appeared visibly broken. I now feel really scared that I've been poisoned. As I said, this is the second time this week I've felt my food has been tampered with. I don't think it's likely that I was unlucky enough to get poisoned two times in a week, so it's clearly my brain that's the problem and not the food but it's hard to believe that fully ):

I never had let her go and I used her as fap material and  then finally after all these years 5 6 years. I deleted them and I said  goodbye.

ttgrsm,"OCD Support. OCD Advice Needed.

\*TRIGGER WARNING\* Mentions of eating issues & possible ED

&#x200B;

I'm a teen, female, and have been diagnosed with OCD since the age of 7. I am also autistic and have an anxiety disorder.

I have ALWAYS been thin, and still am. I've never paid much attention to my eating habits and my health. I often develop compulsions and its absolutely debilitating. My OCD affects my daily life, and has its moments where its seems dormant, and others where I cant escape it. I'm currently struggling with an issue that I believe is extremely unhealthy for my mental health and I am in dire need of some advice.

I can not exactly pinpoint when this issue began (I never really can with compulsions). Though I'd expect it to be early March. For some unidentified reason, I began to become extremely concerned with my eating habits/weight/health. I am a fairly healthy person, I only drink water. I've been eating healthy meals twice a day (salads, sandwiches, soup, pasta). As well as various snacks (fruit, veggies, granola bar, mixed nuts). And one junk snack at night (not every night). You get the gist. I do not have an insatiable appetite. I find myself to be hungry fairly often, but I eat in small portions. I have a fast metabolism, I'm pretty short and tiny, (4'11 and 81-83 lbs). My mother is small, (5'0 and around 100 lbs). I've become increasingly worried I will suddenly balloon up and become 'fat'. Despite my genetics and difficulty with gaining weight. Due to being small, after I eat (not always & depends on meal) my stomach slightly bloats and I look bigger only in my stomach area. I'm constantly worried I'm gaining weight even though the bloating goes away and I'm thin everywhere else.

I've been obsessed with eating healthy meals and have been doing so for the past two weeks (I am NOT starving myself or skipping meals). Today I ate (scrambled egg toast & grapes, apple &pb, veggie soup) But, around 8:45 I ate one Little Debbie strawberry shortcake roll & one zebra cake Little Debbie. I felt insanely guilty after and still do. I'm scared this will throw off my ""health"" despite my water drinking and good meals. I do not know if im developing an eating disorder or already have one. Or if this is just another OCD compulsion that will pass. OR if its a combination of the two. If i do have an ED, why? My mental health is astronomical side from this, I have no family issues and have never had a history with eating problems. I'm honestly scared, I dont know why this is happening. Please note, this is not an emergency situation, and I do not feel the need to inform my parents yet as my physical health is perfectly fine. I do NOT have any health complications, and never have. I am not emaciated, just fairly small.

NOTE: I am in no way trying to be fatphobic. Everyone's body is absolutely perfect as long as they feel healthy. I do not wish to offend anyone and I apologize if I did.

ttbta1,"Catch-22 I think I have OCD and it‚Äôs been present my entire life. (24.5 years old) it got really bad midway through my junior year of college. That combined with Depression made me barely functional.

My compulsion involves making these documents with a title and an activation time. Once the activation time hits, whatever I want to kick in kicks in. In college, it was about being perfect, or not having any doubts, recently, it has gotten meta and been about leaving OCD entirely.

I didn‚Äôt know it was OCD until early February of this year. That realization has allowed me to make some headway. I stopped the document triggers realizing it was part of the problem and not simply an attempt to fix a real problem. I‚Äôve been free for around a month now. 

I have a whole range of compulsions. I‚Äôve gradually been able to let go of the more deliberate compulsions, such as watching for an even time to hit and starting my streak there. (Like 6:00 PM). I‚Äôm starting to work on mental compulsions. The hardest one is literally trying to focus on work. Anytime, I focus on work, I get anxious and ruminate. Naturally, this has made me a poor performer at work and in general.

My problem is that although I have been diagnosed by 2 OCD specialists, I don‚Äôt believe I have been diagnosed until I have been diagnosed by a neutral psychiatrist. I fear OCD specialists may over diagnose to build clientele. Now, I‚Äôm in this weird situation where I want to continue doing ERP to improve, but I don‚Äôt know if I should, since I‚Äôm technically not ‚Äúdiagnosed‚Äù.

I feel like I want to wait to get a diagnosis from a psychiatrist to continue ERP, but I haven‚Äôt started the process to see one and I don‚Äôt know how long It will take and my life suffers in the meantime. 

I want to continue ERP, but it feels ‚Äúwrong‚Äù or ‚Äúinvalid‚Äù to do so. Deep down. I think it‚Äôs just a clever trick by my OCD to stunt progress.

tsz3ya,"For those with Sexual obsession OCD: Don't test for arousal. It's a false misconception lots of people have, that what makes you 'aroused' (it's not real arousal because real arousal doesn't come with internal anguish) is what you're into.

Don't fall for the trap. No, it's not true that if you watch some porn you'll figure it out. Form imagine sexual scenarios to test yourself - I fell for it myself.

Arousal is not indicative of your attraction. If you hate the idea of being with someone but get aroused, it's not real attraction.

Attraction makes you happy, look forward to life, you daydream (positively - not OCD style) about the future with these people, etc. You want it 110%. It's not something you feel turmoil over.

In our world everything has been so hypersexualised it's no wonder some people have OCD centered on sexual thoughts. It makes life a nightmare, and that's how you know it's OCD - because you'd love a life without them and they make you depressed inside.

tt2mzz,"Does anyone else have daydreaming obsessions? For context, I recently got diagnosed with OCD and am extremely skeptical about it. At this point I‚Äôd say that between constantly re-researching the same medical symptoms and scrolling through other people‚Äôs struggles with OCD has become a hobby of mine. 

I wanted to know if anyone else had daydream-like fixations or if my habits of constantly daydreaming can even be explained by possible OCD. 

I‚Äôd say that I‚Äôm always daydreaming. But only when I think up a certain world or dream a plot I think is extremely interesting. And because I think it‚Äôs interesting, I find myself unable to stop thinking about furthering the plot or the world I made. This leads to disruptions in my daily life, which I‚Äôve never truly noticed before.

I‚Äôd spend hours at my desk thinking about the plot of a story, and repeating the events of that plot, from beginning to end. This happens constantly before I have to pull myself away from those thoughts and actually do my homework. I don‚Äôt work a lot, and my current job is relatively light work. And because of that I‚Äôve only recently noticed that my fixation with my daydreams also interferes in my work. I‚Äôve had my coworkers ask me multiple times if I‚Äôm okay, because I‚Äôm just standing or sitting somewhere daydreaming. 

This kind of behavior is normal for me. It appears in my relationships, but I‚Äôve always chalked it all up to being a daydreamer. And I‚Äôm not sure if not daydreaming will cause me anxiety.

tt05sd,"Everything is soaked with ink Slightly strange admission, but I figured this would be the best place to ask. I have been suffering with OCD for a few years now, and can never seem to find a better way of describing the problem than by saying it's as though every single thing on the planet is covered in a layer of ink. 

If I touch something, I will have the ink on my hands, and if I then touch something else without washing them first, I will have put the ink on that as well. 

I used to think this was just germs - like you see in those adverts for cleaning things where there is a layer of animated green germs on things before they are blown away or destroyed by the cleaning product. However if this were the case with my OCD, I could just spray things and be fine; but it's not. 

Because it's more of a sticky ink that I imagine on things, just spraying them with cleaning products wouldn't actually \*remove\* the ink, but simply kill the germs on the surface. So to clean things I need to physically scrub them with water and soap (as if trying to remove a stain of ink). 

Does anyone else have this problem, and does anyone have any tips to living with it?

tt1lk2,"Relatively unknown, fascinating treatment model for OCD and other anxiety disorders I'm a huge fan of the work of renowned psychotherapist and medical doctor David Burns, bestselling author of Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy. Some of you in your quest for relief may have heard of him. He works mainly in the treatment of anxiety and depression. He has credentials out the wazoo.

Anyways, I stumbled upon his ""Hidden Emotion Model"" of anxiety that he claims has proven to be more effective for treating anxiety in the majority of his anxious patients than CBT or drugs. He says that over the years he's seen that classic CBT methods for treating anxiety such as ERP are usually effective in relieving some symptoms in his patients, but were rarely effective in reducing the anxious symptoms to zero. He began noticing the same trends popping up over and over again in anxious patients which resulted in him developing his most effective model for anxiety, the Hidden Emotion Model.

The general gist of the model goes like this:
People who develop anxiety disorders tend to be overly nice people. These people fear conflict and hurting other people's feelings and thus automatically sweep anger and other negative emotions under the rug so as to not upset anyone. The anger they feel with someone close to them, or dissatisfaction they feel with their career or place in life, etc., gets bottled up rather than expressed, and instead gets expressed indirectly as some sort of anxiety disorder such as panic disorder, GAD, or OCD. These anxious people have generally been people pleasers all their lives, raised that way by their parents. When they develop a chronic anxiety problem, they typically don't even consciously know what's really bothering them because they're so used to automatically sweeping their feelings under the rug. Once the true problem or bottled feelings are uncovered and expressed and the problem dealt with, often there will be a total disappearance of symptoms.

As he puts it himself:
""The vast majority of these patients were exceptionally nice individuals who felt a strong urge to please others. In fact, most of them seemed to exhibit‚Äîbeneath their panic attacks, anxieties, and fears‚Äîphobias about conflict, anger, or negative emotions of any kind. They seemed to experience a kind of emotional perfectionism, the belief that they should always be happy, pleasant, calm, and totally in control of their feelings, even at the expense of their own desires and emotional needs.

In other words, when anxiety-prone individuals get feelings or urges that don‚Äôt seem ‚Äúproper‚Äù or ‚Äúacceptable,‚Äù they sweep them under the rug without realizing they‚Äôre doing this. Then they suddenly develop a phobia, a panic attack, or OCD symptoms and completely lose sight of the hidden problem or feeling that triggered the anxiety in the first place. This dynamic isn‚Äôt always happening‚Äîsometimes a phobia is just a phobia‚Äîbut through the years, I‚Äôve observed it in roughly 75 percent of my anxious patients, and when I help them uncover the hidden emotion, the anxiety disappears with astonishing regularity.""

""From my work with large numbers of clients with every conceivable type of anxiety, I‚Äôve learned more about the nature of the hidden problems that trigger the symptoms. First, the problem is almost never buried in the past. It‚Äôs something that‚Äôs bothering the client in the here and now. Second, it‚Äôs something obvious and simple, like hating law school, but feeling you have to stay in law school because your father always wanted you to be a lawyer. Third, it‚Äôs usually a symbolic expression of the hidden conflict. For example, the law student with panic attacks doesn‚Äôt have to say, ‚ÄúDad, I‚Äôve decided to drop out of law school because I don‚Äôt want to be a lawyer. I want to become a journalist.‚Äù Instead, by assuming the sick role, the student can say, in essence, ‚ÄúI just can‚Äôt continue with law school because I‚Äôm going crazy: I‚Äôm on the verge of a nervous breakdown.‚Äù This symbolism isn‚Äôt created at the conscious level, of course. Anxiety is a kind of creative poetry that the brain automatically generates, much like dreaming. As a therapist, you have to ‚Äúlisten‚Äù to the poem to detect the symbolic meaning.""

https://www.psychotherapynetworker.org/blog/details/575/living-with-the-devil-we-know

Dr. Burns also makes clear that usually the nature of the anxiety relates to the nature of the problem. In his book When Panic Attacks, he gives an example of a pathologist who develops contamination OCD when he's working with a cadaver and a piece of a  skeleton that he's working on accidentally gets lodged into his eye. He gets the piece out but develops a crippling fear of contamination and starts taking hours doing compulsions to avoid infection. The man insists everything in his life is fine except for the OCD. Eventually it's revealed that he hates pathology and only does it because his dad wanted him to, and he also feels his coworkers are discriminatory towards him. His OCD slowed his work down and dead bodies started piling up in the morgue which impeded his coworkers' work flow. His OCD was indirectly saying ""I hate this job"" and also ""I don't like how you guys treat me so I'm gonna ruin your work."" He eventually expressed his feelings about the discrimination to his supervisor and also became an ER doctor which he always wanted to be, and his OCD symptoms completely disappeared.

If you look up Burns' Feeling Good podcast he talks about the Hidden Emotion Model in a few of them. I'm sharing this because I find it fascinating and hope it might help some of you. I've also struggled with horrific OCD and have myself always been a chronic people pleaser who is discontent with the status of my life. There are a few things bothering me apart from the OCD that I know I should deal with and I feel I may be closer to relief than ever before.",3,3,2022-03-31 10:57:06-04:00,rel unknown fascin treatment model ocd anxieti disord im huge fan work renown psychotherapist medic doctor david burn bestsel author feel good new mood therapi quest relief may heard work mainli treatment anxieti depress credenti wazoo anyway stumbl upon hidden emot model anxieti claim proven effect treat anxieti major anxiou patient cbt drug say year he seen classic cbt method treat anxieti erp usual effect reliev symptom patient rare effect reduc anxiou symptom zero began notic trend pop anxiou patient result develop effect model anxieti hidden emot model gener gist model goe like peopl develop anxieti disord tend overli nice peopl peopl fear conflict hurt peopl feel thu automat sweep anger neg emot rug upset anyon anger feel someon close dissatisfact feel career place life etc get bottl rather express instead get express indirectli sort anxieti disord panic disord gad ocd anxiou peopl gener peopl pleaser live rais way parent develop chronic anxieti problem typic dont even conscious know what realli bother theyr use automat sweep feel rug true problem bottl feel uncov express problem dealt often total disappear symptom put vast major patient except nice individu felt strong urg pleas other fact seem exhibit‚Äîbeneath panic attack anxieti fears‚Äîphobia conflict anger neg emot kind seem experi kind emot perfection belief alway happi pleasant calm total control feel even expens desir emot need word anxietypron individu get feel urg don‚Äôt seem ‚Äúproper‚Äù ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù sweep rug without realiz they‚Äôr suddenli develop phobia panic attack ocd symptom complet lose sight hidden problem feel trigger anxieti first place dynam isn‚Äôt alway happening‚Äîsometim phobia phobia‚Äîbut year i‚Äôv observ roughli percent anxiou patient help uncov hidden emot anxieti disappear astonish regular work larg number client everi conceiv type anxieti i‚Äôv learn natur hidden problem trigger symptom first problem almost never buri past it‚Äô someth that‚Äô bother client second it‚Äô someth obviou simpl like hate law school feel stay law school father alway want lawyer third it‚Äô usual symbol express hidden conflict exampl law student panic attack doesn‚Äôt say ‚Äúdad i‚Äôv decid drop law school don‚Äôt want lawyer want becom journalist‚Äù instead assum sick role student say essenc ‚Äúi can‚Äôt continu law school i‚Äôm go crazi i‚Äôm verg nervou breakdown‚Äù symbol isn‚Äôt creat consciou level cours anxieti kind creativ poetri brain automat gener much like dream therapist ‚Äúlisten‚Äù poem detect symbol mean httpswwwpsychotherapynetworkerorgblogdetailslivingwiththedevilweknow dr burn also make clear usual natur anxieti relat natur problem book panic attack give exampl pathologist develop contamin ocd he work cadav piec skeleton he work accident get lodg eye get piec develop crippl fear contamin start take hour compuls avoid infect man insist everyth life fine except ocd eventu reveal hate patholog dad want also feel cowork discriminatori toward ocd slow work dead bodi start pile morgu imped cowork work flow ocd indirectli say hate job also dont like guy treat im gonna ruin work eventu express feel discrimin supervisor also becam er doctor alway want ocd symptom complet disappear look burn feel good podcast talk hidden emot model im share find fascin hope might help ive also struggl horrif ocd alway chronic peopl pleaser discont statu life thing bother apart ocd know deal feel may close relief ever,"Sentiment(polarity=0.005683785911058638, subjectivity=0.5060808131262674)",0.005683785911058638,nuetral

\- I cannot watch when someone in a film targets the camera with a gun

\- When I was little, whenever I went under a bridge, I thought it was going to fall into my eyes and I couldn't help but close my eyes.

\- I don't know what to think about many times, especially while trying to sleep. So, I constantly get bothered for the same reason: What to think next? Or something like ""I'm thinking"". So I get disturbed whenever I'm doing something, really anxious about this. I can concentrate on tasks, just like writing this post, maybe I need the urge to always be doing things because otherwise I get bored and start getting anxious on ""I'm thinking"" or ""I won't sleep tonight"".

\- I can't almost wear a ring. I start taking it out, putting it into place... 1,000 times in a row. It hurts.

\- There are songs I can't listen to, because otherwise it will repeat itself in my head hundreds of times. Even sometimes with songs I enjoy, I end up a whole week with the song in my head, can't take it out.

\- If people are not singing perfectly the song, I get distressed

\- I hate to remind my wife about everything. She is quite forgetful, so I always repeat her what she has to do. I guess she has ADHD but we love each other very much. I always thank her for bearing with me.

\- I cannot stand hearing my voice on a recording. I even shout because I hate the way I talk.

\- I cannot stop thinking about sex, even if I don't want to. Even if I had sex, then I feel the urge to masturbate even when I am already ""satisfied"".

\- I cannot stand some people. I believe they are not that bad, but I cannot stop thinking about them and the ways they hurt me (or some characteristic of personality), and next time I see them I am hating them.

\- I open the fridge lots of times in a day. Even some times in a row. I feel anxiety for food. But I want to weigh less.

\- I hate surprises, especially when I have to talk.

\- I hate when I am on vacation, I love my routine. Everything hurts (I have some other health problems) and I cannot sleep well. Sometimes I am all day in ""grumpy"" mode. But even loving my routine, sometimes I hate it. But I prefer it to going elsewhere.

\- It's an agony to get up from bed. Another miserable day goes by. I prefer to dream.

\- I tend to procrastinate a lot during work. I have back problems too, which makes it a pain to be more than an hour sit.

\- I always think about suicide whenever I am sad. I simply do not understand why people want to continue living. It's like death equals to win.

\- I do not feel well until I have read the last piece of news. (I'm subscribed to +100 news sources).

\- I think a lot about my pains and although I'm relatively young (28 yo) I'm thinking I'm dying little by little, and I have low hopes of recovery.

\- I always cringe/tremble when thinking about an event of the past that didn't went as I wanted to (Mostly whenever I said something wrong, or simply weird). I can even shout a little.

\- I cannot play chess because once I played it a lot and then could not stop thinking about it and had a very rough night. Since then I ditched chess, although I liked it.

\- I tend to follow the pattern on the street if I am doing nothing better, but I'd say it's not because ""something bad happens"".

\- I optimise the use of my time pretty a lot, I cannot stand people not being as diligent.

\- My father hates psychiatrists but after commenting about him with them, he may be suffering from Diogenes disease or even schizoid personality disorder. For a whole year, the only thing I could hear from him was a ""Hello"".

\- My mother has been always very demanding, even throwing to the bin works that I did when I was little (even several pages long), making me repeat them entirely.

\- I always been afraid of talking in public, can't stand it. After so much work, I can read and   
and pretend I'm talking freely when needed, but never have been able to talk freely in front of, for instance, 10+ people.

\- I always prefer to do things alone.

\- I was no. 2 in my faculty in Engineering. Although I procrastinate now more than before, I have been pretty strict.

I am taking Paroxetin 20mg per day. I have improved overall in all areas I mentioned now, some things better, but largely I feel that there is a large improvement. I know Paroxetin acts like an anti-depressant. I wonder if it really attacks the OCDs (Or if these things are normal). What would you say about these things that happen to me?

tsnsid,"Does anyone else have constant obsessions over stupid reckless shit you did as a teenager? I swear to god this is what my brain always goes to as soon as it can't find anything to obsess over. I have one big event in my life that I constantly obsess over that I really only talk about with my therapist and the moment I stop obsessing over that, boom let's think about stupid shit you did as a teenager.

It's always driving for me. I'm 22 now. I got my license and car at 16 and I thought I was invincible. I did so much stupid shit. Right now i'm obsessing over this time I passed someone going way to fast in an opposing lane. I was in a hurry and there was a long stretch of road. I remember getting up to like 70 or 75 in a 50 to pass a car. Or maybe it's a 45, I can't really remember. I remember, even at the time, thinking ""wow that was stupid I could've hit someone and injured or even killed somone.""

I keep going back to that road because I still live near it and just driving up and down, trying to pinpoint the exact spot it happened to see if I had a clear view or not. There is a spot you're allowed to pass but it's kind of on a hill and the view is a bit obstructed. I'm not sure if this is a good exposure exercise or if i'm just giving into my compulsions but I just feel like my whole world in coming down on me again.

I just keep trying to pinpoint every single detail and remember every single thing so I could see if a car had been out in front of me if I could've avoided it or not. Either way it was a stupid thing to do. Every time good things happen in my life I think about stuff like this and feel like I can't be happy because of what could have happened. Or that I couldn't be sad if one of my loved ones was on the opposite end of a situation like this because of the stupid reckless shit I did as a teenager in my car that could've hurt or killed someone.

I've been doing good with my treatment. I make consistent appointments with my therapist, i've been steady on my medication, and i've been trying to avoid seeking reassurance. But I always find myself back at square one, like I am right now, obsessing over random things (usually driving scenarios).

I talk to my dad a lot about stuff like this and he seems to have done things as a teenager that were far more reckless than me when he grew up in the 80s. He's no stranger to mental illness, but he doesn't struggle with OCD so he doesn't really understand why I obsess over situations where things could have gone very wrong but didn't.

tsw3sh,"Obsessive loops - is there a way to feel healthier? Since I was 14 or so I've struggled immensely with Pure OCD. It began with unwarranted obsessions about my sexuality. I had a girlfriend at the time, yet my brain would convince me I'm a homosexual. When spending time around my close male friends I'd have thoughts like: are you checking out his arse? Kiss him (when I was close to him) and other variations of that. It drove me insane and really made it difficult for me to understand myself. I drove away my close guy friends because of this - which was a shame cause I was popular in high school and played football and did boxing.
Next it was schizophrenic OCD. I was convinced I had schizophrenia - I would analyse my thoughts, be convinced that when my mind was replaying conversations at night I was actually starting to develop schizophrenia. This has been a theme since and the thought of losing my mind absolute terrified me to my core.
After this it came and went, mainly in the shape of health ocd / hypochondria - i was convinced I had lung cancer, testicular cancer - you name it.
However, it got severely worse after I had a traumatic brain injury in 2018 after falling off a 30 foot wall and fracturing my skull. Because of the damage I had sustained I was required to rest in the house for months and I began to develop Harm Ocd. I became convinced I was going to hurt a member of my family. I was convinced I was going to become a serial killer. I literally spent months (almost a year) utterly broken and worried of what might happen if I lose control. It was at this point I seeked help and realised it might be OCD - how could I possibly be all these things, its like my mind would pick up on my biggest fear and convince me its possible - this gave me relief to some extent but it didnt change how my brain worked. 
Since then, I've had quite a traumatic break up with my ex which triggered another obsession and has been tormenting me since. I really dont know how I'm going to get through life if this is how my brain operates. Outside all of this I have alot going for me: I'm a straight A student when I keep my shit together, I'm good with people and a good salesman, I can play sport and I try keep myself fit. 
But im really lost internally. All of this has happened in my defining years - I'm 23 now. This has been going on for around 10 years and its completely disrupted my sense of identity and my trust in my mind. Im now on the verge of failing university after not submitting assignments due to my mind being all over the place. I dont know what to do anymore.

tswtwp,"OCD and self induced bodily sensations.  Just found out by self diagnoses I have OCD... I'm hyperaware (basically 24/7) of self induced bodily sensations or tend to hyperfocus on small meaningless sensations making them huge because my hyper focus increases the sensitivity tenfold.

Never had any real OCD problems but it just blew up when I had some negative experience and thought that my physical problem (dizziness) would be forever. This caused me to hyperfocus on it (actually causing the dizziness for months after).

My bodily symptoms are not due to anxiety as in getting afraid of something that fires up internal anxiety symptoms. But the thoughts about the future (afraid that this symptom will be forever and that would be disastrous) causing me to hyperfocus on certain symptoms and also feelings wishing them away. The best example I can give is heart palpitations before sleep. I don't have heart palpitations because i'm stressed or have anxiety, I have heart palpitations because I ""know"" this will prevent me from falling to sleep. So I ""automatically"" hyperfocus on my heart once I go to bed. I start to feel my heart beating (not fast, only 45-50 beats, but just very loud and noticable). Just like you would bring your attention to your breath and notice it. But instead of wanting to bring attention to my heart, I don't want to bring attention to my heart. 

This focus stops me from falling a sleep. But the reason behind this is fear of not getting enough sleep which is considered bad. This results in a vicious cycle because I don't sleep enough (according to my mind) causing me to feel not rested the next day. Causing even more desire to get a good night rest. But this is also causing even more compulsive checking on my heartbeat because that prevents me from getting a good nights rest (sometimes i'm awake for many hours). Only when i'm so tired i can't even think (or can't be bothered anymore) about my heartbeat and I sleep just fine.

So instead of accepting feeling my heartbeat or accepting that a bad nights rest is not so bad I focus on not feeling my heart beating. I'm totally conscious and aware i'm trying to stop feeling my heartbeat and I know it does not help but in the moment the desire to stop feeling my heart is so big (or the fear of not getting sleep is so big) so I get lost in thoughts trying 100 ways to stop it. In that moment I just can't simply focus on it and feel it because the desire to fall a sleep is much greater. I do try feeling it but that is a trap because in the back of my mind I already know if I truly do want to feel my heartbeat it will stop beating (in the sense of not feeling it).

This same process is happening for other bodily sensations I feel during the day. For example, I had a peep in my ear. The thought that this peep would be forever caused me to hyperfocus on the peep making it even worse. Causing me to focus on it even more and causing more fear for the future (will this ever go away?). But this does not concern me anymore so now I don't even hear it. Not sure how I overcame this I just stopped thinking about it on a conscious level. Not trying to get rid of it. I simply don't care anymore. 

Another major part in this is stress. I'm stressed all day. Not because of something is wrong in my life. Just because I think stress is bad for my health. So i'm stressed about having stress causing the stress in the first place... This is also impacting my sleep so my desire to have a good night sleep for recovery is very demanding. This has nothing to do with feeling my heart when trying to sleep by the way.

So what i'm struggling with is what I should focus on. It's not the feeling that is the problem but the thoughts about the feeling. So I'm stuck in a eternal battle of what would be best. Feel the feeling or work on the thoughts or both? 

Funny thing is, when during the day when i'm focussing on some other sensation I think ""ok let's shift my focus on my heartbeat"" (because I don't want to feel the other thing right now) and then it's impossible to feel it even beating. While at night in bed it's impossible to not feel my heart beating haha. It's just in the moment I'm totally stuck in the desire to stop feeling the feeling caused by fear about the feeling. I can't even feel my heartbeat when doing the most intense MTB ride on max effort. But i'm able to focus on whatever feeling i don't want at that moment. Even during the most intense MTB ride.

I'm simply not able to not be (mentally checking( in my body anymore. I'm 100% aware of my body 24/7 with a negative body scan. I know this can change because I did not have this problem for 30+ years so I know how it feels to be focussing on something else or just be in the moment. The desire to wish these things to go is so strong in the moment they happen it seems impossible not to focus on it.

When there is a moment (very rare) that the symptoms are very minor or almost none existent i'm always 100% aware. Thinking ""Ok, now I don't feel/care about the sensations that much. What am I exactly doing right now?"" And the answer is always the same: nothing!

I'm not trying to wish it away, not thinking about it, I just don't interfere with my mind. So the next time I do feel something and things getting worse I always think of those moments when everything was ok. But then thoughts pop up about doing nothing and how to do nothing. But the paradox is you can't do anything about doing nothing. Meaning just stop thinking about something. Then I'm trying to stop thinking which obviously does not work haha. But you can't stop thinking about something consiously.

Now my recent addition to this problem were some mild RSI complaints after excessive gaming. This happend 3 weeks ago. Never had any issues with this but I did spend more hours than usual. But now my focus is stuck on my hand and arms. Feeling all kinds of things related to RSI. Tingeling, cramps, can't even work or type normally. Because of OCD I can't tell if the symptoms are real or just imagination. Probably the latter because I've been through this so many times but I can't stop focussing on it. Because of the fear I can't do my work anymore (working in ICT) and to never game anymore (my biggest hobby). Been to a few fysio therapists both said nothing is wrong or damaged. Still when working or gaming everything burns and can hardly use my arms anymore. It's just the same thing with my heart at night. When I focus on it, sensations become tenfold enhanced. Causing me to focus on it even more.

Been to therapy few times but that was about general anxiety. Not knowing I had OCD. Did mindfulness and tried various things. But no matter what, I always use these things as a ""method"" to make the sensations go away. I know this is not how it works but I can't help it. Like, alright lets do a bodyscan because I know a bodyscan helps. But it surely does not help when doing it with the intention of making the feelings go away. 

There is also a very high sense off annoyance. For example when doing a body scan but In the mean time i notice my heart beating during the entire session. Pisses me off... Ofcourse causing me to focus on it even more. Not afraid of having a heart attack or anything. It's just annoying. Just like the peep in my ear. Not worried I can't hear anymore but annoyed of hearing the peep all the time.

Does this sound familiar? How can I break this cycle and not seeing everything (excersises) as a way to not feel my sensations? I think it's about working on accepting feelings and emotions but I don't know where to even start.

tsu4zf,"I feel like OCD took my whole life away from me I had OCD as soon as I was old enough to think. It kept me from having normal friendships (usually) as soon as I started school. It occupied most of my time so I didn't do much for fun. Pretty much anytime that I did try to have fun, it was ruined by anxiety. My ""strange behavior"" as a kid due to OCD caused me to get bullied and excluded. Therapy and medications never made any kind of difference. By the time I was 12 I was feeling suicidal because I had developed POCD and had no idea what it was. By the time I was 14, I was essentially just having delusions. Acting on my compulsions was always horribly embarrassing and easily ruined relationships, but I had to do it anyways. My first real boyfriend at the age of 15 became the fixation for all of my OCD. This went on with any relationship I've ever had and still to this day. Though it isn't as severe as it used to be.

It started a few years back when I got more into watching films, and I'd obssess over whether or not I was enjoying it enough. When people had other opinions to the movie that I didn't have, I'd start to obssess over why I didn't enjoy it/enjoyed it more. I started watching more films and not enjoying them, because I'd keep having a recurring thought of if I was enjoying it enough or if I was getting into it enough. I had to stop watching films all together because of that.

Then it started to leak into TV shows, whenever a TV show drags just a little bit I started freaking out thinking that I'm not enjoying it as much as I should be, when I watch YouTube videos which is something I really used to enjoy, I'm obsessing over every minute and checking that I'm immersing myself in it and getting enough entertainment from it. It's gotten to the point where doing anything I used to enjoy is a huge task and I feel like a failure when I'm not immersing myself 100% in a show, movie or video. Whenever I get the thought of ""Am I immersed in this enough"", I get completely brought out of whatever I was doing and then start obsessing over not being able to immerse myself back into it.

tsx5ym,"idk if this is OCD but don't know where else to ask ever since i was young i have had these weird 'tics' that are not really tics exactly because they're completely voluntary but when i was younger the most common one is hard to describe but i would flex my throat muscles/very back of my tongue. i would become obsessive over it and it would end up hurting my throat but if i didn't do it it would make me so uncomfortable.

another is the flexing of my jaw which i still do now and again it becomes like an anxiety thing of ""i have to do this because it makes me uncomfortable of i don't"" and this sometimes ends up hurting my jaw too.

i can't even play with my PlayStation remote anymore because the joysticks make my fingers so uncomfortable if they're not completely centred to my thumbs and for some reason when im holding it i get this really strong urge to bring my nails together and scrape the tips of them against eachother and if i don't do it, it drives me insane.

it also makes me uncomfortable when there's no pressure on the sides of my belly like if im wearing a loose shirt so i keep applying pressure to my sides with my thumbs and digging my nails into my skin when i do it. it's so annoying because now I have a really dry red area on the side of my belly above my hip which looks really wrinkled and strangeüôÉ also if im stood in the kitchen cooking i get really riled up about there being no pressure on my sides and have to stretch to stretch the sides of my stomach to feel something on them which is kinda embarrassing and weird but if i don't do it it pretty much sends me into a panic attack

tswld2,"How does one deal with real event OCD? I'm 20 years old, although I've never been officially diagnosed, I've had MANY symptoms of OCD for most of my life witch has led me to believe theres it's very likely I have it.

Might not be as relevant but should maybe also add that It's been suggested by a range of different people (including a social worker) that i'm likely on the autism spectrum. It's not particularly hard to believe either as I've always struggled socially (I dislike things such as eye contact etc) and didn't speak until I was 4.

The OCD (if that's what I actually have) has taken on many forms such as how items are placed, contamination, intrusive thoughts and what not.

More recently, I've found myself not being able to let go off of moments from the past. I find myself coming up with questions revolving around ""well what if in that bad thing you done, it had this terrible circumstance meaning it was actually worse?"".

I've practised ERP, not in a therapy setting but rather by myself on the basis that I know OCD is made up of irrational compulsions and that as soon as your brain begins to realise there's nothing at risk, it'll start to diminish and go away. I'm aware it wouldn't be the most ideal option by myself but I'm not sure whether or not I'd be ready to do it with a professional.

I know that ERP is also practised with the real event component but I'm not sure how that would work because without knowing what had actually happened I feel at unease. Would anybody be able to shed some light on this? That would be greatly appreciated.

tsjrm0,"Let's talk about OCD's best friend: smartphones, and why they create a vicious circle in your life Disclaimer: this might not be everyone's experience. Maybe you have OCD and have 0 problems with your scroll time and it has never affected you. However, I know how much it has affected me and others that I've known through this sub.

I am currently getting out of one of the worst spirals of OCD I've ever had in my life, even though I was at a great point in my life and in my recovery. Even though I'm slowly getting out (got a therapy appointment after a while next week!) I still have 0 energy during the day because I spent the majority of my time focusing on recovering, facing the thoughts, exposures... you know the whole pacakage, while still trying to keep up with survival basics (water, food, sleep) which we know is not an easy task with OCD. At the end of the day I feel mentally exhausted but instead of scrolling through my phone until dinner I thought  I would write this post in hopes to reach someone with the same problem.

**My story with phone usage**

I have unfortunately encountered phone and electronic devices during a very though time in my late childhood around 11 yrs old, aka bullying. I was bullied and picked on for a few months until I decided to change schools. During this whole time, I had like, one friend but no one that I would consider close. I was extremely isolated, depressed and anxious (with some OCD slowly creeping into my life), and just like magic, there came my quick fix: 8 hours of computer time with 2 hours of phone time, in the dark, alone, to drown all the anxiety that was already bubbling up. I wouldn't take care of myself in anyway, wouldn't drink, ate in my room, rarely shower. (*My parents did intervene and they were aware but I'm not going to write about that because it would make this post endless, but for those concerned, they tried to help me*). 

This all came to more or less an end when I found friends and hobbies later on. However, I still had and I still have way more hours of screen time than any of my friends. Aaand then we got to the pandemic. With the first lockdown, I had one of my first full on episodes of OCD and what better way to numb the pain than to use our phone? 

So after 2 years of this hell, I'm starting to work on ditching my phone because I realized how bad it feeds the OCD. 

So, why does phone addiction goes hand in hand with OCD?

1. Some psychologists think that OCD is linked to the ""flight"" response to danger. According to some theories (if you're interested, look up polyvagal theory) people with obsessive tendencies tend to be in a chronic flight state where they constantly run from perceived dangers (in our case, our intrusive thoughts) by avoiding/numbing/distracting in any way possible (doing compulsions, numb with substances, ask for reassurance, ruminate, **USE DISTRACTING DEVICES**). That's why so many of us developed such an addiction to our phones: they numb at least some of the pain out.
2. Social media is a **huge pool of reassurance**, especially subs like this, but also places like advice subs. Sometimes my brain literally tells me that I cannot trust myself in any way so it makes sense to go to those subs because you feel like everyone but you is capable of judgement. Of course, needless to say doing this keeps you in a loop.
3. There can be other reasons **based on your themes** and your compulsions. A big one I can think of is definitely ROCD: checking couples on instagram to see if they're better or worse than you. But there are so many other reasons: HOCD (looking at pics on social media to check feelings), POCD, religious OCD... the list goes on forever.

So there are extremely good reasons why you're glued to the phone. Now you might think that this is just a side effect of OCD, and that compared to experiencing OCD ( which is a kind of nightmare I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy ) this is nothing to worry about. But the thing is, scrolling so much is setting your brain for disaster!

Think about this: OCD is linked to low levels of serotonin in the brain. Phone addiction is linked to [difficulties in cognitive-emotion regulation, impulsivity, impaired cognitive function, addiction to social networking, shyness and low self-esteem](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.669042/full#:~:text=Results%3A%20Comorbidity%20with%20depression%2C%20anxiety,shyness%20and%20low%20self%2Desteem). 

Also, using your phone as a coping mechanism for OCD is a big obstacle for building resiliency against it. If everytime we have an intrusive thought we try to numb out using our phone, then we are implicitly saying to our OCD ""yes, there's something to worry about"".

You're living with two sources of constant mental dread , OCD and your phone. They're both exhausting your brain and they keep feeding off of each other. OCD thrives in the mental exhaustion that you are in when you doomscroll! It's a fertile terrain to give you a big slap in the face because at that moment you have poor cognitive resources to fight against it. 

If , like me, you've always used your phone as a way to numb the pain, to muffle the sound of the intrusive thoughts, you know how scary it feels to even think about not looking at your phone for like 2 hours, because that means being alone with your thoughts. Just by thinking about it I squirm. But the only way out of OCD is through, and procrastinating that by using our phones for ours is only going to delay the beautiful progress we have ahead of us.

tsvhz0,"Girlfriend smoking is becoming a weird issue for me This is gonna be a weird and a bit lengthy post, hope that's okay. Not sure if this fits here, but I've struggled with OCD in the past and I think my current problem is part of an obsessive thought pattern...

I recently started dating a girl who smokes. I knew about it before we started dating and from the beginning, I've felt a bit uneasy with it, but my attitude towards it has gotten worse.

I've always been very adamant about never picking up smoking and I still view it pretty negatively (though I don't push that on others).

I have quite a few friends who smoke and it doesn't bother me at all. But when I see my girlfriend smoking, or even think about it, my stomach sinks and my mood goes south instantly. 

Rationally, I know smoking is bad, but it's really not as bad as to warrant my reaction towards her smoking (for example, I drink and don't live perfectly healthy myself, so I bet there are smokers who are healthier than me). She doesn't seem to want to stop soon and I don't want to pressure her or take it on me to make her stop, so I'll just have to deal with it.

I tried a few approaches: looking away when she smokes, trying not to think about it, thinking about the reasons it bothers me, actively thinking about it and trying to control my reactions towards it... but no matter what I do, my feelings towards it get worse. It's not *that* bad yet, but it's definitely not ordinary and I want to tackle it before it becomes an actual problem.

tsdios,"(WARNING GROSS) Little win over my contamination OCD last night So last night I used the bathroom and I had really bad mix of diarrhea and normal poo, which is due to a medicine I take (not for OCD, something else), and when I flushed there were poo skid marks in the toilet. I kept flushing and flushing in hopes that it would just go away on its own but it wouldn‚Äôt. I was filled with dread and while I usually try to ignore or let someone else handle it (I know I shouldn‚Äôt deal with my problems this way), the skid marks were really big and noticeable and I share a bathroom because I leave in a dorm. I didn‚Äôt want my roommate to see it because I knew if I saw something like that I‚Äôd freak out or be really annoyed. So instead of leaving it I got to work.

I knew I had to touch the toilet wand and I HATE toilet wands so much. They always gross me out and the one in our dorm bathroom was especially old. Because I was dreading this, I started with the bleach first (probably didn‚Äôt need bleach but better safe than sorry). So I got a huge wad of toilet paper and grabbed the bleach, which sits in the same weird holder as the toilet wand, and their was water in the bottom of the container. The water was REALLY dirty and had stuff floating in it and I thought I was gonna puke but I pressed on. I sprayed the toilet, promptly returned the bleach and went for the toilet wand with a new wad of toilet paper. The toilet wand had the same exact problem except worse and so it was already dripping before I started using it. I got to work on the toilet and scrubbed at the skid marks,and it made the toilet water and awful cloudy color. I was hoping that it‚Äôd only take a couple scrubs but the poo was really on there so I was scrubbing much longer than I‚Äôd had hoped. I got it done though (thank god), and returned the toilet wand. I flushed the toilet again, and the water was clear and there were no poo marks any more.

I washed my hand for like five minutes after and kept getting more soap because I felt so unclean. Once I got back to my bed I immediately took of the sock I was wearing, threw them in the hamper, and then started using copious amounts of hand sanitizer. I didn‚Äôt think this way enough so I also wiped down my body with Lysol wipes.

tsrcd5,"Contamination OCD I (female) have contamination OCD of sexual fluids, and its more about the disgust and feeling of contamination that germs and sickness. (This is gonna be TMI, I'm sorry about that) So I started masturbating without cleaning anything on my bed, with my clothes on like I usually do. I don't feel the need to clean anything on my bed, but when I moved on to doing it on my desk chair, all the sweat and ""contamination"" concentrated in one small cushiony seat of an ergonomic chair made it worse. Doing it repeatedly made the place obviously very contaminated and made me associate the chair with the action and contamination, and how it has that ""extra"" contamination that other chairs don't. I feel even people without OCD would clean it and won't do it, or would avoid the chair and find it disgusting, and that I'm taking exposures too far and its just dirty and unhygienic and not required. It also made me feel like I'm disrespecting my study space, and doing it anywhere other than my bed is worse contamination and being disrespectful, including communal spaces. My family and others borrow and use this chair sometimes as well (people sit on my bed as well and I share my bed as well, and I face similar issues there, just a lot less intense), which makes me feel guilty and shameful. I basically feel guilty for spreading my fluids and contamination around and to others without them knowing or expecting it. I recently also noticed that sitting on my chair makes me sweat really fast and I thought it was cuz of all the sweating that happened there, especially cuz of the cushiony seat of the chair, and it made me really annoyed. I finally thought I should only do the deed on the bed like normal people, even for exposures, especially cuz of the sweat. I cleaned the chair with soap and water which is the compulsion I usually used to do, but I feel the need to clean it properly and its giving me anxiety. I feel like choosing not to do it on the chair is going to make it worse by making me more cautious, and doing it on the chair and the sweat, along with the fact that others will use this chair whether or not I'm around, makes me uncomfortable and gives me anxiety and distress. But the sweat and disrespect (along with the contamination and guilt, etc.) is making me want to properly clean the chair in detail so its not associated with masturbation and contamination in any way.

All this was only about the chair, but I guess its the same case with any place other than my bed, though even doing it on my bed causes distress and all the stuff I mentioned to some extent.

What should I do? Should I clean it, should I leave it, should I contaminate it again or more?

Anyway, growing up, we had money, great, doesn't excuse some of the shitty things my mum did. We had enough money, we had a nice house, and she hosted students for a little ""extra money"", to do this, I would give up my room for months, even years at a time, and sleep upstairs in this box room, which didn't even have a bed just a matress frame thing on the floor. It was uncomfortable. She then cheated on my Dad, and got with this abusive prick, who hated me, and she never once stood up for me. Again, she then got with a new guy, a narcissistic asshole, sociopath who toyed with all our emotions and once again we were cast aside. He called me all the names under the sun and emotionally toyed with my little brother which I think has messed him up (he's now 11 but was 8 at the time). I could never go to my Mum for advice because she just gets angry with me for having mental health problems and acts like it's an inconvenience... (ironic since she works with children with mental health issues) but never has any sympathy or understanding or researching what her own daughter is going through...

I walked out at 16/17 - And fended for myself with my now fianc√©. 

Roll on a few years and she's out of the toxic relationship. Shes there for me through my miscarriage.  Great. For my 2nd one? Yes but still got annoyed with me for having ocd issues. Fast forward to now... She's paying for my therapy, letting my stay round hers when it's really bad, feeding me etc because the ocd got really bad... but then, since she's got a shiny new boyfriend (tbf he's not a dick this time) she has been acting like I'm inconvenient again, she was all caring until a new guy came along... and doesnt seem to want her mentally ill daughter ruining it for her. Last week she implied it wasn't such a bad thing that I had my miscarriages because of my mental health issues. No - I actually was coping really well while pregnant, cutting out compulsions and working really hard at recovery for the sake of my baby. Was actually almost fully better and then went and lost it... She seems to have no hope for me and its ashamed and aggravated to have a daughter who isn't ""normal"". And when I called her out on this she said I've thrown her kindness ""back in her face"". But how could I have when she is giving me mixed signals? Being kind to me, then making hurtful remarks about my baby and mental health, all those years when she wasn't there for me, I feel like, she kind of owes me??

tsjdos,"Triggered because of a duster brush I only buy books whenever they are in perfect condition in the store and I always keep them clean, no matter what. I never touch my books if my hands are not fully clean. Even after I wash my hands, I wait minutes so they dry (lest they get dirty when I wipe them in a clean towel) and only then I dare to touch my books, and even then I barely open them up when I read. 

There's some dust in my room but it doesn't affect my OCD. So basically my table is very dusty except for the place of my book. My mother knows that I hate it when someone tries to touch my books (even though every other family member ignore this). Today she used a duster brush (the one I already told her not to use ever) to brush my table and the book I've been keeping on my table for months now (and I still kept it totally clean and germless) became all dusty between it's pages. I had been keeping it completely clean for months and she messed it up in a minute. 

I hate all this and I hate myself because of how easily I'm triggered. And then my mother asks ""Is it that big of a deal?"" ‚Äî What am I even supposed to say in a situation like this?! It means nothing to her and she wouldn't understand it even if I told her how big of a problem that is for me. 

I hate all this because I almost told her about my disorder, what would've happened then? I hate myself because of all this.

tsmpyn,"dealing with intrusive thoughts and magical thinking.. vent I guess (long rant but asking for some advice at the end)

that ""something bad is going to happen"" feeling hit me like a truck a few days ago and now I'm so anxious. 
for a long time, especially over the past 2 years, my fear that I cause bad things to happen has gotten so intense. 

2020 it was at its peak, not just because of covid but also due to some traumatic stuff. I was set to move back to my hometown on 2/29/20, I was so excited and looking forward to the future.. my grandfather died 2 hours before I got there. my sister and I drove up 9 hours and actually had left around 2 hours later than planned. we originally thought we were going to have a few more months with him after he got diagnosed with cancer. he got really sick like two days before and I begged my mom to let me fly up there early, but she told me it would be okay (she probably knew he was dying and didn't want me to go through that, which I understand).  
and then covid started a few weeks later and it all went downhill from there. had some more family deaths that year and some other random stuff. I became an alcoholic and was more s*icidal than I have ever been.

every time something bad happened my brain managed to somehow connect it back to me. did I do something to cause this? did my mere existence in this place in time /in the universe cause this? it got so bad. my grandmother got covid a few weeks after i moved out and she almost died. through 2021 it started to simmer down and it's been mostly okay since then. 
i haven't talked about it too much in therapy, I have avoided talking about my ocd bc f*ck no I am not doing exposure therapy while covid is still a thing (I also have germophobia and have luckily avoided covid so far, probably due to that lol). and I've lived with ocd my entire life, it's just my normal, I know I need help but I have a lot of other stuff going on and always have other priorities to deal with in therapy.

I am visiting my grandmother this weekend and right after I booked the tickets I started getting anxious. nothing really bad has happened around me in a while. I feel an oncoming sense of disaster. I'm still going on the trip, as I'm taking advantage of the covid lull and I'm not sure when I'll be able to see my grandmother again after this.

As you will likely know, with OCD, it is SO RIDICULOUSLY HARD to figure out 100% certainly what it is that you want. Thought loops create self-doubt where it wouldn‚Äôt exist for other people. Trying to check, double and triple check to make sure something would never be regretted after the fact, even with minor decisions like grocery shopping.

So, with that, it seems like so far for me in life, the best teacher has been experience. Only, pregnancy is NOT something you can just so easily try out and then stop if it‚Äôs not working, like pursuing certain life goals, dating someone before realizing incompatibility, etc. Obviously.


I am really unsure as to whether I would 1) be ok with raising kids or 2) physically be ok with going through pregnancy, the overall medical experience of your body enduring that.

On one hand, I always thought I wanted kids, but I was also very raised into that idea.

On another, I am trans (FTM), so there is a big fear of increasing my existing physical dysphoria and incurring regret from it all.

So these days, as I begin to give more adult thought to it, I still don‚Äôt hate or love the idea. My pros and cons list is very 50/50 and my end feeling boils down to a blurry ‚Äú??????‚Äù. Because, well, how can you know if you‚Äôd be ok with it, unless you are THERE, experiencing it!

The idea I‚Äôve come to is that I need to have some real-world experience around kids, which hasn‚Äôt been the case since I actually was one, since none of my friends at the moment actually have any. I‚Äôve considered becoming a babysitter or a nanny of some kind. The other option, is, I guess, casually dating someone who had a kid (and was ok with a casual relationship, and many probably want something more serious, no?).

One thing that neither of those offers is that I want to see how the physical side of pregnancy plays out, see the belly grow over time and try to understand how I‚Äôd feel about that happening to me. I can‚Äôt imagine any situation that would offer me that chance.

How would I find this out in actual practice and not just in theory? Are there groups or something that I can sit in on? I‚Äôm struggling here.

One thing that complicates it also is that I‚Äôm visibly trans and people tend to think LGBT = pedo for some bizarre reason, so despite literally having a uterus myself, many mothers‚Äô social groups or jobs like childcare would probably discriminate and push me out. I have heard of this exact thing happening to others and it‚Äôs depressing. I live in an area that is not as gay-friendly as somewhere like San Francisco and it‚Äôs a real possibility.

tsdjkt,"Anyone else labeled as a ""perfectionist"" when they were younger? I was thinking about a conversation I had with my parents a while ago where they mentioned that many of my grade school teachers, including my counsellor, would often mention that I was a perfectionist during parent-teacher meetings. My counsellor even asked my parents to give me this one book called ""Mistakes That Worked,"" which is a book about how many cool inventions were made by mistake. She even advised that I try playing in mud to get rid of that mindset. 

I didn't think much of it at the time, but looking back I realized that was probably one of the early indicators of my OCD. My parents never pressured me to be perfect, so I'm not really sure where else I got that mentality from.

For a long time, I've wondered if what I have experienced and endured from my own mind was more then GAD. I match the criteria for the disorder, but sometimes I wonder if what I worry about is more similar to OCD. Not only what but the VOLUME of the things I worry about feels exsessive. I just can't shut the worry and intrusive thoughts off no matter what steps forward I take, or what coping mechanisms I try. It's gotten to the point in these past few years, but this one specifically, where It feels unbearable. I worry about everything all the time, most of my fears steming from the fear of dying or my actions (or lack of actions) resulting in those I care for most/those around me dying or me hurting them. I can provide more examples if it would help, but I just feel so lost.

I'm asking for others experiences because I am going to be starting therapy again soon after a few years of not having it. My first therapist was helpful but after feeling I ""graduated"" therapy, her help didn't really change things in the long run (mainly because she just gave me mindfulness excersizes and talked me through my current surface level issues). I may be overthinking, but I would appreciate anyone's input and experience here of when they realized it were told what they experience is more then typical worry, it helps me understand my own, and see if I should make sure whatever therapist I do see is able to treat OCD.

ts5fbu,"My girlfriend broke up with me and my obsessions are getting worse trigger warning for suicide, intrusive thoughts, and references to body horror

\*\*\*

Hey everyone, 

I'm sixteen and am homeschooled in a very conservative Christian community by adoptive parents. I'm not diagnosed with OCD because my parents don't believe in treating mental health and predominantly attribute my compulsions with lack of faith and/or typical adolescent struggles; they refuse to see any reason for my behavior beyond what is the accepted norm, despite my doctor advocating for me. However, I have received a few therapy sessions to ""restabilize"" me after I sliced my arm open in a suicide attempt and had to get five stitches at the ER. The woman I've spoken to thinks my issues aren't debilitating or intense enough to warrant further treatment or diagnosis, though she concurs my symptoms are pathological in nature. 

I am really suffering right now. My girlfriend just broke up with me (my parents don't know I'm gay) and I have a horrible intrusive thought that there's a parasitic organism inside of my stomach or head - I can't figure out which. I've had it since I was ten but now it is getting much worse. It's such a distressing thought that a few weeks ago I made myself throw up several times to get it out of me. I think about swallowing chlorine to kill it or smashing my head open or cutting into my stomach. The thought triggers whenever I'm hungrier than usual or have excessive abdominal noise, as these are both symptoms of parasitic infection. Usually when I talk about my bad thoughts, I talk about my fear of tooth infection or a periodontal disease and how I brush my teeth all the time because of it, or how I think when I think about something too much it's going to make it happen (if I think about my mom dying in a car crash, she might do it, etc., which is less pervasive and more easily assuaged than the others.) I talk about this much less often because it grosses them out. It hasn't ever been as prominent as it is now. I feel very panicky and the anxiety is exhausting. 

I have a self-harm problem and a lot of self-loathing for being gay. I don't know how to get support as I'm not plugged into public school and though there are people who do take me seriously - my neighbors, whom I'm very close to, for instance - they aren't capable of providing serious help. 

Does anyone have any advice or resources?

tsn7eb,"Doubting my short term memory Hi all!

I keep obsessing over something that happened last night with my husband, and I‚Äôm doubting if my memory about it is correct or not.
So last night, we woke up in the middle of the night, apparently really horny üòÇ We started making out passionately, when he asked if I would go down on him, I said no because I was too tired, and he asked me if I wanted to stop altogether and go back to bed, but I told him I would take care of him and give him a handy (sorry to be graphic lol) So he guided my hand down there, we did our business, we went back to sleep. 

Now today, I‚Äôm doubting my memory, as it was all sort of fuzzy due to it being the middle of the night, and I keep getting intrusive thoughts of ‚ÄúWhat if you didn‚Äôt offer to give him a HJ and he guided your hand down there without being prompted?‚Äù 
I talked to my husband this morning and told him I don‚Äôt think we should do anything sexual in the middle of the night anymore since there‚Äôs always this sort of  fogginess and weirdness the next day surrounding it. He totally agreed, and said he doesn‚Äôt want me to feel weird about anything of course. 
But I can‚Äôt shake this thought that keeps coming back of what if I didn‚Äôt offer to give him a handjob and he just put my hand down there? I‚Äôm fairly certain that I remember offering, but I also remember not really liking that he guided my hand down there. I also asked him today to not guide my hands places anymore and he agreed. 
I‚Äôm trying to resist the urge to ask him AGAIN about it and get further clarification on it, but it‚Äôs so hard. 
Consent has always been a huge theme in my OCD and it makes me question literally anything sexual, even leading to sexual avoidance at times.
Does anyone have any advice?

tskvni,"OCD intrusive thoughts, and relationship issues A bit of background about me, I have OCD intrusive thoughts, I was on medication for 1.5 years from early 2020 to the end of summer 2021. My OCD, which was not diagnosed back then was one of the reasons that my last relationship didn't work out.

Hi, I am having an issue in my relationship and life in general. I have been dating an Australian guy for 2.5 years, and our relationship is great, we are thinking of getting married maybe 3 4 years down the line after he finishes his Ph.D. I am from Vietnam, and we live in Europe. However, lately, I have been haunted by the thought that I need to be available to go back to Vietnam and live there at any moment because my parents might get sick, so I might need to break up with my boyfriend or something. This starts off with my mom asking if I don't miss her, don't care about her, or even randomly calling me in the middle of the day to cry. However, it's not an issue now after I have been honest with her about how I feel and my life plan. But now, it gives me this thought/fear that keeps coming up. Every time I come across any relationship advice from any podcast or youtube video that mentioned something along the line of ""your life plan must align for it to work"", then this 1% possibility that something bad happens or my parents get old and I must go back to Vietnam and live there but that's not really his plan.

I have been trying to reason with myself and with my boyfriend about it many times. And we both agree that it's a very small probability, and regardless of who I am with, I would have some sort of similar problems. I also have a long list of reasons why I should stay abroad (better for my career and sanity), and why living in Vietnam does not necessarily mean seeing my parents more often because there is a lack of work-life balance, and also the fact I can't stand them for an extended period of time. 

However, I just keep having this fear/thoughts whenever I am stressed out or alone, and it's really hammering my well-being and our relationship. At this moment, I don't even know if this is a real issue, that needs to be addressed, talked about, just an intrusive thought, which I should just ""let the thought go"".

tsktw2,"How to cope with weed withdrawl heightened OCD and anxiety  

Hi there, I keep trying to post this on r/leaves and it keeps getting deleted? I don't know why. I just really want some help.  
I am a marijuana addict. Weed withdrawal heightens my illnesses, especially ocd. I'm not sure how to cope.  
I am medicated for OCD on prozac, but it's a low dose. I'm trying to get it upped as soon as possible so it can help. I'm probably going to have to wait a couple months to get it up to 60-80, which is horrifying because of what I'm about to say. but I'll live... i hope.

I am SO tired of smoking. I'm trying to quit for real this time after many failed attempts. Throughout all of this, if there are any benefits, I've realized I have really bad OCD. so i've been using weed to cope with ocd, along with other things. makes sense I guess.

So naturally, when stopping weed, it all comes back 10x as strong. If nothing triggers me I can get along fine. My appetite is a little lower, but I'm more productive and clear headed. I'm a little scared I've ruined my short term memory irreversibly though; I smoked tons for around a year and a half. I'm really praying once all of the thc and cbd is out of my system, my memory will be like how it was before.

But nothing's really that boring. In fact, things seem way more interesting and invigorating. It's just the panic attacks and overwhelming anxiety at times. Last time I tried to quit I was up til 4am panicking over a friends well being because of my ocd, even though  he was completely fine. I was hyperventilating, crying for an hour, and just completely unable to cope with my emotions. I eventually just took a hit of weed to calm myself down. I want to prepare to cope with things like this  
 so I never have to touch that plant again.

My parents are lifelong stoners, so when they see me have a panic attack, their natural inclination is ""want a toke? it'll make you feel better."" and this has caused me to fall back in several times. I think I might have to bottle up my feelings so I don't freak out in front of my parents; I'm really not sure how to even do that. I have supportive friends but the only people in my life physically are all stoners. I have to wake up and smell it every day, all day, and that's the hardest part. Doesn't help my mom wants to hang out, too, and all she does is smoke. I have to avoid her for a while and it really sucks.

I'm extremely excited to finally quit, but horrified I won't be able to because of this cycle. If anyone has any tips of how not to lose their mind over things during weed withdrawal, I would greatly appreciate it.

tskswq,"Trouble Making Decisions or Having Opinions Does anyone else have a lot of trouble making decisions, or even holding opinions (especially ethical or political opinions) since being treated for OCD? I started seeking serious professional treatment for OCD, PTSD, and a phobia about five years ago, and as I realized how many of my decisions were based on fear and avoidance, I started having trouble figuring out who I really am. For example, I had a habit of signing petitions on my phone while walking anywhere, because I believed that if I wasted a single second of time, I was behaving immorally. I refused to throw away non-recyclable items like empty plastic tubs because I believed that it made me a bad person. A lot of these beliefs came from my mother, who also had OCD and various paranoia issues. I kind of just adopted her way of thinking about everything because doing otherwise as a kid would cause her to tell me ""I knew I couldn't trust you, you don't really care about the planet, you're just as bad as your father, etc."" So I know that I should be happy to get away from that rigid way of thinking. But what's left over is...nothing. 

I try stepping out of my shell in various ways - I throw things away, I back away from politics, I eat foods that aren't vegan, etc. When I do these things, I feel careless and nihilistic. I know that I'm freeing myself, and that I should feel stronger, but I just feel like I have lost all meaning instead. Take for example the idea of making consumer decisions. I used to think that buying a product that wasn't as environmentally friendly as it could be made me a bad person. Now, I understand that that isn't true (even though it's good to care about the environment, everyone has to use plastic bags once in a while and it doesn't make us evil). But, when I stand in the detergent aisle looking at a biodegradable detergent and a less expensive non-biodegradable detergent, I just freeze.

I have no idea where the line is or what I really believe. It feels like I have no say in the decision, it's just my mother and my therapist and my boyfriend arguing in my head. ""Buy the biodegradable - what, do you want to destroy the planet?"" says my mother. ""Buy the nonbiodegradable, you have to defy your mother and do what will benefit you in the long run. Don't you want to save money?"" says my therapist. ""Buy whatever, no one cares, consumer decisions don't make a difference to big companies anyway,"" says my boyfriend. Where do I come in? When do I get to have an opinion? I have no idea what I think in that situation. I feel like I don't have a self sometimes. I left that store on the verge of tears and this isn't even a big decision that matters a lot.

ts9vex,"OCD has been worse recently, any treatment/ coping recommendations? Hey there! Long time, first time~ 

I‚Äôve been dealing with OCD, anxiety, and depression for most of my life at this point. Throughout college my mental health has been in flux between some of its highest highs and lowest lows, I imagine this isn‚Äôt too uncommon of an experience. However, recently my OCD has been especially bad, anxiety inducing, and all encompassing. For the past couple of years I have had multiple weeks long episodes where I feel so trapped in my own head that it‚Äôs hard for me to feel like I‚Äôm an active agent in my own life. In the last few weeks specifically I‚Äôve been extremely stressed and my anxiety surrounding having a psychotic break or losing control has been especially bad, and of course the worsening anxiety, intrusive thoughts, and self isolation because of my OCD make that seem like a very real possibility in my brain. To be Frank, I‚Äôm just not sure how much longer I can cope acting as I have been, but I‚Äôm also not sure about what to do next. Like, I‚Äôm writing this after just coming down from a no-reason panic attack that struck me this afternoon, I had another major one just yesterday night (again, no specific triggers), this doesn‚Äôt feel sustainable. 

The last time I went to the doctor I mentioned my worsening anxiety and he offered to up my prescription (I‚Äôm currently on 50mg of Sertraline). At the time I said that I‚Äôd rather wait until I could start therapy back up, which I haven‚Äôt been able to do yet. He did give me 6 Valium to deal with the panic attacks (at the time I had a specific event I was stressed about) thus far I‚Äôve not taken any of them. 

I guess I‚Äôm mostly looking for advice or similar experiences anyone has had. I‚Äôm torn because at this point I likely wouldn‚Äôt be able to build a relationship properly with a therapist for a couple months. Obviously this illness is different for everyone, but if anyone has been in a similar place I was curious if they‚Äôd have any recommendations for what to do. Up my antidepressants and see if it helps? Use the Valium during the worst of the panic attacks and cope for the rest of the time? Look into a supplement to accent the sertraline?

Although I have many various routines, there's this new one that came out of nowhere just recently. I keep hearing swear words especially slurs in my head.

I really hate myself for saying those words in my mind. I'm afraid that one day they might slip out by accident and offend someone or make me look like a complete a**hole.

ts6e7d,"I have terrible religious OCD, and maybe I did something so WRONG, LIKE REALLY WRONG, AND I REALLY NEED HELP IF I CAN HAVE IT FROM SOMEBODY Ok, I'll start.

&#x200B;

First, I'm 17, I've been suffering OCD since being eleven or twelve years old.

I'll tell you what I may have done:

I had thoughts of selling my soul and offering my family to the devil. What I really don't know is how is that done or something.

I really live in constant worrying in that it may have happened 'cause I don't really know how's that done. But I see my family ok and normal and I don't see them have something wrong. But I really felt that I did something wrong to them.

Those thoughts just don't go, and I seriously wanna leave them so I don't do anything

Currently, I don't follow God anymore and honestly I prefer not to do it anymore. I would like to know if for the thoughts I can get another kind of help.

But I really want to know if I did those evil things, because I REALLY REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED

And I just live doubting and doubting and doubting.

And I really want to commit suicide or die but I just can't just for thinking the pain of my mom when I do. But maybe it will be better if I die, like it's justified, like if I do, it would just prevent myself from hurting or still hurting people.

I really didn't want to be a bad person, a satanist person, I don't know if I am though but I just don't know what do, or if I'll be rejected by people and I guess that's fine because maybe I do deserve that

I‚Äôve been messing around with my dose amount because of side effects for the past 2 months and have been on a crazy roller coaster ride of times.

I just bumped up my Prozac about 14 days ago and just now feel like maybe I‚Äôm doing better, but I‚Äôm not sure I trust it, if that makes any sense???

That sucks. I‚Äôm bad with germs too!‚Äù or ‚ÄúWow! I also hate people‚Äôs noises! I don‚Äôt spend an hour mimicking them to make myself feel better but sometimes I have the urge to shout at them!‚Äù

(It‚Äôs one of the reasons I‚Äôm thinking about dropping her as a friend, among many other reasons.) 

I mean, I don‚Äôt want people overly pitying me and I know every other mental illness is hard to live with too, some of the mental illnesses people live with are so severe I can‚Äôt even begin to imagine their feelings. And I don‚Äôt run and tell strangers about it to make them feel sorry for me. But I wish people like my friends and family who I should be able to trust and talk to understood how crippling OCD is.

I‚Äôve had a few friends who have told me that they can‚Äôt imagine what I go through, they will be here for me to talk to them, they think I‚Äôm incredibly strong for working so hard to overcome my OCD, etc. Again, I don‚Äôt want people feeling sorry for me and I know it could be worse and that other mental illnesses are just as difficult, but validation every once in a while helps a lot.

trwmdk,"Could this complex I have have been part of my OCD all along? I've been diagnosed with OCD years ago along with a plethora of things like anxiety/autism/adhd and potentially cptsd and there's one trait I have that I've started to be realizing might be connected (my ocd is closer to the pure o kind)

&#x200B;

My thing is that I sort of have a complex about the concept of being ""genuine"" or ""performative""? Like for years I would avoid talking about like world issues and such cause I felt like if I started I'd have to engage with the whole spectrum of things and I'd end up just talking about things cause I felt like I was supposed to and that would be bad. In general, I have a fear of both doing something performative or being perceived by people as performative or attention seeking. In church as a teen I remember receiving strange looks because when they told us to do things like stand up I wouldn't do it because I knew I'd only be doing it to impress other people and I wouldn't mean it and god would know I didn't mean it anyways. One thing that really freaks me out that prompted me to ask about this though is thinking about the concept of writing a professional email. I thought about it too hard tonight and my stress levels have skyrocketed because it's something that makes me feel sick to think about doing. I just think ""But I would never actually say that/talk like that"".

To keep it short I have existential OCD and OCD rituals I need to do at night in order to get at least a little sleep in. This involves intensive cleaning, moving things back and forth, turning fans on and off, messing with the thermostat, opening and closing medication lids multiple times, etc. On top of that I do also have existential OCD that has literally made it impossible to think about anything else. I have CRIPPLING insomnia and sleep-anxiety. The ""rituals"" I perform at night can go on for hours before I can even begin to think about laying down. If something gets messed up or out of place, I have to repeat many of the same things I already did. It's horrible. I am probably underplaying it here, but it truly is hell. It's obviously made me suicidal and I fucking hate my existence. Lately the frustration at night has gotten out of hand to the point of me sweating, being angry, and now...feeling incredibly nauseous.

Anyways I was curious for those of you who have been through the harm thing, did/do you think about the theme every time you see any hiding related to murder or especially anytime you see tools that could be used for murder? 

I live on a farm with my family so I do a lot of outdoor work. That means I have to dig holes, I have to use axes, I have to use saws, I have to use sledge hammers, I have to use knifes. Every time I have to use them it triggers the thoughts of murder. It‚Äôs like immediate association. If I see something that could be used to harm someone my mind immediately goes to the same thoughts as above and rumination.  

No reassurance plz, but can anyone relate? What helped you? I know ignoring the thoughts is the best avenue but they get triggered alot. Idk I‚Äôm kinda at a loss. I really want to get better and trust myself cuz it‚Äôs really hard on the mind and soul to stress so much about such deep, real, intense things such as becoming a murderer. It‚Äôs fucked me up tbh.

i cant do this anymore. when my ocd started, i felt weird and anxious and i didnt know what it was but at least i could still somewhat function. i felt like myself somewhat. my obsessions were annoying and sometimes scary but they were silly and i overcame them eventually. now im a year in and ive totally lost myself. im in hell every day. every waking moment is torture and i have the most vile and traumatizing obsessions and this thing has evolved to give me intrusive feelings as well. it convinces me that ‚Äúdeep down‚Äù i wanted to do the most terrible things even though ill literally be panicking that i dont want to. im constantly afraid of my girlfriend leaving me because i have horrible abandonment issues and this is what fuels my obsessions. i love this woman so much that my ocd ruins my entire life trying to make me lose her.

tonight ive lost my mind and ive realized that there might be something about me that legitimately makes me a bad person. i have to tell her and im terrified itll shatter the trust and love weve built up over 3 years. i dont even know if we will make it to our anniversary in like 2 weeks. i want nothing more than to kill myself and the only reason i havent done it is because i love my family too much to traumatize them like that and there is still a stupid ignorant part of me that wants my old life back. i sob every day over my obsessions and im constantly trying to calm myself down but now i feel like everythings already over and im going to lose the person ive been fighting through this for.

tr1ona,"I had a bad sexual fantasy that I didn‚Äôt realize was bad until later. Now I can‚Äôt trust myself and I‚Äôm questioning my judgment in past sexual experiences. I‚Äôm going to puke. About a year ago I developed a recurring first person sexual fantasy that only later I knew was very bad.

The fantasy was born from a hook-up where my hookup taught me to make her ejaculate. I thought I got superpowers. Riding on my excitement I began fantasizing showing someone they could ejaculate for the first time. The girl in the fantasy said ‚Äúwait stop I have to pee‚Äù not knowing what the pee feeling was and I‚Äôd say ‚Äúhey it‚Äôs okay, it‚Äôs about to get really good‚Äù in an assured caretaking tone. She‚Äôd lie back down and I‚Äôd continue. The fantasy concludes with her mind being blown. The appeal of the fantasy was showing her something good she didn‚Äôt know and her praising me after. 

The fantasy replayed til I realized it was fucking disgusting and assault. The worst part is I nonchalantly thought I could maybe try playing it out irl. I also didn‚Äôt realize it was wrong for weeks. My view of the fantasy was warped and I believed I was benefitting the girl in the fantasy. She was just confused at the sensation. Once I explained assuredly (ironically I thought my assured tone would add safety but actually could be forceful to her if she was real), I‚Äôd just **assume** her confusion/hesitation would be solved and she‚Äôd be down to keep on even though the fantasy girl said stop. 

I wonder if I actually could‚Äôve carried out the fantasy if faced with the situation irl. I think I wouldn‚Äôt but maybe it‚Äôs wishful thinking because there‚Äôs a part of me that probably could. I took on the assured caretaking tone to people before as if I knew better than them, not in sexual scenarios as far as I remember but now I‚Äôm unsure about that. 

What weak view of consent would I have had to have, the same view I guess brought to past sexual encounters, to not see anything wrong with that fantasy?

trn8lq,"My Girlfriend has OCD, and I need help. Recently, I've been very stressed and anxious around my girlfriend. She has frequently been having these episodes that happen in a very specific order. Generally she goes completely silent and had a blank stare as if she's deep in thought. Soon after she becomes highly irritable and agitated to the point where I'm worried to speak or make noise as to not make her angrier. Any time I consult her or try to talk to her to see what's the matter, she quickly and aggressively replies ""Nothing, I'm fine"".  After a few minutes of tension filled silence she then tends to grab a blanket and stuffed animal and hide away from me or back away from hugs, back scratches and back rubs. I try to do what I can to make her feel comfortable and safe but it only seems to make her more upset.
I feel extremely guilty just typing this and I'm sure this will make me seem rude, but these moments tend to scare me pretty badly. I'm a very anxious person so seeing her like this has been really getting to me lately. When this routine happens it generally feels as if I'm the problem or I'm making her situation worse. I can't tell whether or not this is the case as She doesn't want to speak to me and no matter what will never talk to me about what's wrong neither during or after these moments. Anytime I talk to her about it she shrugs it off and disregards my concern. 
The lack of communication here has lead my mind to fill the gaps with this mindset that I'm the problem and that I'm what's making her so upset and by me trying to help her feel better I end up just hurting her more. 
I don't want to be that for her at all. I want her to feel safe, comfortable and relaxed at all times and when she's not feeling well like this I'd like to be able to help her in any way I can.

I suffer from severe contamination OCD and am absolutely terrified of the floor and things that touch it, not so much due to germs but the thought of things from the ground trasnferring onto me. It's something that goes through an unlimited amount of ""cross contamination"" where the thought process will be me overthinking that disgusting things and particles from people's shoes are on the floor, then I'll think about all the places people walk with their shoes (public bathrooms, etc.)

I can barely function, I can very rarely leave the house or even my room, I go through hundreds of latex gloves per day and one of the main things I always try to avoid is making any contact with the floor or things on it because of the extreme stress and irrational thought processs that comes with it.

This morning I woke up and I had somehow flipped my blanket to the side, so one end of the blanket to each side of the bed, I then without thinking readjusted it and put it the correct way, but I immediately considered that I might have flipped it the wrong way, with it being sideways I don't know which end I usually have my head and body under and which end I have my feet under.

I have been in a panic attack about it.

To summarise, it stemmed from the possibility that the end of the blanket that has touched my feet was subsequently flipped and rested on my body/face.

I have had two showers, brushed my teeth, washed my mouth out with mouthwash and I still feel contaminated. 

The craziest thing about this is I don't even know if any of its true, it realistically could have been either end and in reality I don't even know for sure that the end that usually touches my feet was flipped, i suppose it's very much 50-50, but that's more than enough for me to stress excessively.

tqxyg5,"I can‚Äôt stop thinking about being r*ped by a guy I hate. Why? To preface this: No I‚Äôve never been r*ped in the past, so not PTSD related, and no I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a fetish for me. I can‚Äôt tell for sure though.

Basically there‚Äôs a guy I really dislike, can‚Äôt stand to be around him really. He was my ex-boyfriend‚Äôs best friend for a year or so. Very bad guy. They had a terribly toxic friendship, he is very manipulative and basically just did everything he could to make others believe he was incapable of taking care of himself (so they would give him money, food, place to stay, etc.) He was a homeless opioid addict. There are too many instances of him being gross, perverted, stupid, aggressive, unreliable, deceitful, controlling, and scummy to list so you‚Äôll just have to take my word for it.
He was a barnacle in my ex-boyfriend‚Äôs life for a long while. Ex-bf was a very soft-spoken and malleable person at this time so he was an easy target for his manipulation. Now he has moved on to hanging out with pedophiles and nazis I guess.

For some reason I find him attractive and I have no idea why. I have so much destain for him that I could spend hours explaining why I hate him so much. He is a decently attractive guy and is very charming, like a class clown type almost. My belief is that he learned how to make people adore him to get what he wants, because beneath his charm there is an ugly beast waiting to sink his claws into anyone he can use for basically anything.

He invades my thoughts constantly. I daydream about scenarios of him taking advantage of me often. Kidnapping me, r*ping me, hurting me, you name it. I have a few theories as to why I have this urge to experience such things. It could be that because he has never done anything to me directly, my mind craves a valid reason to hate him as much as I do. It could also be that I am used to being sexually involved with people who are somewhat similar to him. I‚Äôm really lost on this.

It feels like a dirty secret. I find myself bringing him up a lot, trying to find a way to work him into conversations. I‚Äôm just simply obsessed with him but I don‚Äôt know what I exactly want from him. I haven‚Äôt even spoken to him in months. I have literally zero interaction with him but my mind has latched onto him. I think it has to do with my OCD/ROCD in some way. I‚Äôm just stuck on him.

When I was dating my ex, I constantly had to think about him and consider him as a factor in my relationship because of how much influence he had over it. He was with my ex all the time, ate up all his free time, caused him so many problems that in turn affected our relationship‚Ä¶just that kind of stuff. He was also very antagonist and tried to cause problems between me and my ex on multiple occasions. Even recently he has spread a rumor about me to my ex to try to cause problems, since he knows I don‚Äôt like him and doesn‚Äôt like me because of that. Or some other twisted reason.

Another theory I have is that I want his attention because he is constantly the center of attention. Tons of people are obsessed with him. Whether they love him or they hate him, he‚Äôs a very popular topic of conversation among many different groups I have encountered. But I want his attention in a way that could alleviate me of taking responsibility for this attraction I have, so it being against my will could account for that.

I want help. I want to be thinking about normal things, not some weirdo guy doing things to me. I feel like I need someone to think about in this way all the time and he‚Äôs just my latest subject of arousal. It‚Äôs like this void I need to fill inside me. I need to have sexual fantasies about bad people. The sexual fantasies are only a part of it, they just happen to be the part that upsets me the most. I‚Äôve had obsessions like this in the past, where I‚Äôve constantly brought up certain people whose validation I wanted. So really it‚Äôs not about the guy, but what he represents. I have more people that I am obsessed with as well. It‚Äôs nonstop, compulsive, and I fear it‚Äôs going to get me into trouble somehow. I fear that people will find out. I feel disgusted with myself knowing how obsessed I get with random people.

tqpwjb,"I'm getting sent to an eating disorder program even though I'm not anorexic, I just have OCD, and I don't know how to become ""medically stable"" without treatment for the compulsions that make me starve myself I just need to vent I'm sorry. 

I have OCD, and it presents itself in a few different ways, one of which is pretty straightforward contamination OCD, and the other is around food. 

My OCD is obsessed with numbers. It's NOT about how I look. I've had body image issues in the past, but I'm happy with what I look like now: I think I look slim, I look good in my clothes, and I'm comfortable and confident in my body.   
It's just about the numbers: counting calories and limiting the number I can eat in a day, hours I go in between meals,  weighing and measuring the amount of food on my plate, number of times I chew a piece of food, rituals around meals and eating, constantly checking my weight and trying to achieve arbitrary numbers on the scale that don't align with the bodyweight I actually want to be. 

It's NOT an eating disorder, but I get that it *looks* like one since I'm not eating, counting calories, and weighing myself a lot. But I've talked to 2 different therapists, 3 psychiatrists and my GP, and they ALL agree that I'm not anorexic, I'm obsessive-compulsive: my disorder is egodystonic while anorexia is egosyntonic. I don't think I'm fat or disgusting, I'm not trying to punish myself by starving myself, I don't think I need to be skinnier and I'm not afraid of food. I WANT to eat food, god I miss pizza and icecream and literally anything that isn't oatmeal, greek yogurt and grapes. 

I had an outpatient OCD program I was going to go to, but they pulled out at the last minute; they won't take me until I go to an eating disorder treatment or hospital and get medically stabilized since I'm underweight.

How am I supposed to get ""stabilized"" without receiving treatment for the compulsions that make me starve myself?? If I could just \*decide to eat\* enough to keep myself healthy, I wouldn't *need* OCD treatment!!

I don't like being like this. It's getting worse and I'm losing a lot of weight very quickly and I'm scared. I don't like not being in control of myself like this. I'm not getting my period anymore and I don't get hungry anymore either, and my stomach is always upset. I'm too boney and my clothes are all too big. I cried when my dad cooked my favorite meal for me because my brain wouldn't let me eat it. I WANT to eat food! I want to have energy to do things I enjoy and put time into the things I'm passionate about instead of spending all day sitting around obsessing over food and feeling like shit because I'm literally, medically starving!

tqd1bj,"I got scolded by my uni prof for asking for an extension due to OCD, depression and burnout As the title suggests, I am in university, and OCD, depression and extreme burnout are just making my school life hell lately. I asked one of my profs for an extension for an assignment (and TW: I actually self-harmed the night before), and she came back with a reprimand that made me sink into a deep depression. She  wrote in three paragraphs that I should not be requesting extensions, as next time at work I won't be able to ask for them. While this is true, her stern words were very triggering and caused me to have a full blown nervous breakdown.

It is also this reason about not surviving in the real world next time that got me really depressed and hopeless, which caused me to fall behind in my coursework. I tried so hard to fend off my compulsion spirals and my fuel burnt out, and I sunk into a depression that has not lifted still. I \*did not\* tell her that I self-harmed and attempted \*\*\*\*\*\*\*, because I did not want to alarm her. It seems like the effort I put in before the mid semester break came to naught for her, and all she sees is my failures and her perceived laziness of mine.

tre6pe,"I think I have OCD and I'm reluctant to bring it up to my new therapist. Howdy! I'm currently in therapy for anxiety and depression, but I had been wanting to bring up therapy with my therapist due to certain things that will get me in ""trouble"". 

It's mostly happens when I'm around my partner/sister/mother (the people I'm around the most). My actions are usually me realizing they're doing something ""wrong"" and I cannot stop talking about it until it's done the ""right"" way. 
For example: my partner and I were buying some wine and he gets a box to carry it in. He puts a bottle of wine in the box and carries it without holding the bottom- he's just holding it with one hand. I felt like there were alarms going off in my head. It got me in ""trouble"" because I was repeatedly saying ""Can you please hold it the right way?"" To which he got understandably annoyed by. I only realized later that I was being really annoying. Another example is that he got a new car and put the spare key in his wallet. To which I repeatedly said ""you shouldn't keep it there it's going to get lost, keep it here, ect...."" he gave valid reason of keeping it in his wallet but I just couldn't let it GO. Again, u til later I realized how obnoxious I was. 
This happens often- I see someone doing something the ""wrong"" way and get really anxious that something will drop/get lost/ break and have to repeatedly say things until it's right.

tqudyj,"I pretty much constantly have intrusive thoughts, to the point where even when I'm completely preoccupied my brain will basically repeat gibberish over and over It's so hard to explain, but I've always called it ""other people's thoughts"" for some reason. It only really happens when I'm preoccupied with something physical and repetitive. It feels like since my brain is so used to making intrusive thoughts, that even when my brain is mostly in use, there's a part of it that tries to activate those intrusive thoughts but doesn't have enough conscious energy to fill them with my own things.


I work a job with a bunch of different physical tasks. So, say I'm like pressure washing all day, it takes a certain part of my brain to focus on this, I'll catch my brain just saying a sentence over and over again in someone else's voice, and the sentence doesn't even really make sense most of the time, and if it does then it doesn't really apply to anything im doing. It'll be like a young woman saying ""the part of that is where the everything is being."" Or an old guy saying "" if it fits it's the right size, but if it doesn't then it isn't"" while I have a general idea of the age, sex and race of this person saying these things. It feels like the person is being interviewed or something. 

It's not ""hearing voices"" these are just loops of thought in other people's voices that I've dedicated to a random character I've unconsciously made up in my head. This only ever happens when I'm mostly preoccupied. It's annoying and disturbing, because it's like a nagging over and over again that I have a hard time stopping. It just feels gross, really. Listening to podcasts and music completely fixes the problem. But I really wish I could just be in the moment with a silent brain while I do these things.

I‚Äôve spoken to people and even the person I wasn‚Äôt nice to and though it all seems ok now, I can‚Äôt seem to get over it. I read a quote once that said ‚Äúif you didn‚Äôt think about it then but do now; chances are it‚Äôs OCD‚Äù

So what I guess I‚Äôm asking is do you think it‚Äôs ok for me to use that as a basis for my recovery.

Because I have experienced this for years with no end in sight.

I am biracial and identify as a Black American.

My mind is constantly occupied with thoughts related to racism against Black Americans and being paranoid that everyone I encounter holds racist views. I get these thoughts of some horrifying event that will cause great embarrassment to black people and me.

Honestly, I have internalized racist views and sometimes feel other people are right when they think we are inferior, violent, our culture is bad, etc. Whenever I see another black person do something criminal or stereotypical, I feel shame and guilt and that they are confirming racist people right. I feel personally responsible for their actions.

It's hard for me to see a black person behaving badly as just an individual. No, they're that *black* person. I try to combat this by looking up or remind myself of bad behavior committed by people of other races or write a list of black people I know who aren't that way.

I've talked to other black people about this and they understand, but it isn't as intense for them. It doesn't preoccupy their minds 24/7. I've actually considered suicide partially because of it.

tqwa79,"Best way to exfoliate when you have OCD? I'm so exhausted :S Hi there.

I've had OCD for years now but, recently I was scratching at my skin in the shower and all this gross skin stuff was coming off like all the dead skin was rolling up like little tiny bits of Play-Doh and being washed off. It was honestly horrifying for me and since then I have been completely unable to shower without scratching and scratching at my skin until there is nothing at all coming off.

I'm trying to transition to a better and healthier way of exfoliating than scratching at my skin with my nails which leaves horrible red lines and often cuts and scratch marks.
I want to use some sort of tool but I am afraid nothing will do the job properly. Everything I've tried so far (dry brushing and loofahs) don't get the dead skin off like scratching with my nails does and there's always more skin left over if I try other methods that I end up scratching away anyway.

It's really debilitating and can take me up to half an hour of scratching at my skin for it to stop coming off. It's really disgusting to me and I hate the thought of having all this skin accumulating on my body.
How does no one else feel this way? How can other people just not even think about it or care? My partner never exfoliates and doesn't see why I would?

I just I really cannot stand the thought of the dead skin just accumulating on my body. And it only makes it worse when I hear dermatologists recommending daily exfoliation because it's so exhausting mentally and physically.

I never used to do this so why and what do I do to ease it or cope better? I don't want to damage my skin either and my partner says scratching it is only tearing my skin and hurting it.

I'm just so tired.

I (18m) was in another country this weekend and went clubbing. I got shitfaced and ended up getting beaten up somewhere in or outside the club. Only thing i remember is me lying on a stone floor and some people assaulting me (kicking and throwing me around i think, it's all a haze) and me thinking it was somehow people i knew (i think because my brain tried to connect the dots on what was going on and settled on them being friends who betrayed me for some fucking reason). Rest of the night i spent in jail where the police put me to sober up because  i was drunk and acting aggressively because i was going on my instincts and thought everyone was trying to hurt me, including the police.

To the point:
I am here thinking of the possibility of getting raped. I only remember small fragments from the events that took place and they were all violence but no cock in my bum. I have been diagnosed with a really bad case of ocd as a kid where i washed myself for nearly 6 hours every day, then i got put in a psychiatric ward and healed really well. After that shitshow in recent years my ocd came back but it had ""shifted"" into intrusive thoughts about being gay and constantly thinking and doubting my sexuality (it's a real thing i shit you not). In recent months i have been able to get pretty much over it and have declared myself gay-free. Is there a legitimate possibility or has my ocd shifted again into the worst shit imaginable?

I'm wondering if this would speak to anyone else. I had DPDR for a while, and now I've been suffering, what I believe to be, existential OCD/depression.

I'm having 24/7 thoughts about consciousness, the nature of reality, of existence... I've been reading (especially Nietzsche) and watching a lot of philosophy on YouTube.

There's one thought I can't get rid off somehow, the fact that reality could be a simulation, and that, knowing that, that reality could change or ""shatter"" in the next second, like being in the next second in a universe that wouldn't make sense... It makes it hard to live my daily life...

tqod0r,"Would this be considered OCD? 

This post is long overdue. 

To put it simply, For the past several years have been living with this sense of unease and discontent with the fact that there exist forms of technology that were invented after I was born. Namely, the technology that triggers these feelings the most is the ability to take a photo or video and then post it online, wirelessly, from a smartphone, allowing others to see your experiences in near real time. 

At times, when I‚Äôm reminded of the existence of this common technology, I begin ruminating over the fact that I‚Äôm effectively younger than it (I was born in 1997, so ten years before the iPhone and even longer before Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, etc.). Therefore, I feel the need to search for examples of this technology that might have existed (at least as a concept) around the time I was born. So far I have discovered the work of inventor Steve Mann, who built wearable computers and is known in particular for transmitting pictures to his website in the 90s from a wearable webcam. There‚Äôs also Philippe Kahn, who paired a cell phone with a digital camera and laptop and emailed photos of his newborn daughter in 1997 to a couple thousand people, then founded a company, LightSurf, that developed wireless multimedia messaging.  Those are the only two precursors to modern media sharing I know of. 

Then I have to try to form some sort of mental connection between those early concepts and today‚Äôs world in order to ‚Äúsatisfy‚Äù these thoughts. I have to keep reassuring myself until they ‚Äúclick‚Äù, but then after a few minutes the connection expires and I have to perform this ritual over and over again until the thoughts decide to buzz off on their own. That‚Äôs the simplest I can explain it; there‚Äôs other details and specifics but I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre important in getting my point across. 

There are remission periods to these thoughts, during which I still think about them but don‚Äôt necessarily find them troubling. These usually last a couple of weeks, but lately they‚Äôre few and far between. I had a particularly severe episode during a birthday trip I took with my parents in January, brought on by my mother so much as posting pictures of me to Facebook, not to mention the two chicks live-streaming from the hotel jacuzzi, where I went to try and escape the thoughts. 


I think all of this has something to do with my aging; like, I don‚Äôt feel all that old but the awareness of the technological change that occurred within my lifetime contradicts that sentiment. This uncanniness could explain why turning the milestone age of 25 allowed the thoughts to escalate to the point where I couldn‚Äôt even enjoy myself on my vacation. Still, there is little objective reason why these thoughts are so bothersome, and they can get very specific in ways I can‚Äôt really describe. 

I‚Äôm currently doing talk therapy sessions over videoconference with psychologist, which is only getting me so far. What I have been considering is reaching out to another specialist for medicinal advice. My reasoning is that this obsession does seem to match the overall framework of what OCD and Pure O are (intrusive thoughts, mental rituals, seeking reassurance, etc.), so starting a medication made for OCD (I‚Äôm currently on 40mg of Prozac for anxiety) in addition to the talk therapy might target whatever brain mechanism causes these thoughts. 

However, I‚Äôm still not exactly sure how the subject matter of my thoughts would be classified (as in, what OCD subtype they belong to, if they‚Äôre OCD related at all). So rather than make a hasty self-diagnosis, I figured it was time to make this post before moving forward. This obviously won‚Äôt act as a formal diagnosis, but I feel I should gather information from other people who might know things I don‚Äôt before making any decisions as how to combat this. My ultimate goal, I guess, is to get that ‚Äúremission period‚Äù to persist so I can be more in the moment and enjoy the more special occasions in my life. 

So, what do you think‚Äôs going on here?

tqryet,"What should I do ? 

Hi I‚Äôve been dealing with this over the last 2 yrs. It all started from taking a large dose of an edible and I suffered a horrible panic that brought a complete change to my mind. Ever since then, I‚Äôve had this combination of depersonalization and fear of unable to control my thoughts. I‚Äôm a senior in HS and during this year, those fears have reintensfied to the point where it has been difficult for me to concentrate in my baseball games. Those fears include thinking about thinking (hard to explain - I have awareness of when my brain switches consciousness as that what caused me to have the panic attack off the edible. When I drink alcohol, it becomes worse the days after), my blinking , eye floaters, breathing, etc during my games and during school. It is hell for me as it has gotten worse over the past month. I feel like I have no answer to these fears as I used to be able to combat them with stuff I‚Äôve learned since the edible that has worked. I feel like it went away during my junior year because the amount of stress quarantine brought was minimalized. My question is that should I try taking antidepressants and stuff like that ? Over theee last two years, most of the time I‚Äôve felt comfortable with these thoughts but never fully happy ever but able to live and do things. Now its difficult for me and it makes life hard. Some days are better than others though. I‚Äôve always been very against taking antidepressants as it scaries me a little bit and I don‚Äôt want to be label as a pussy as my Dad would put it. In addition, I have a feeling that the pills won‚Äôt help for some reason i don‚Äôt know.

Right now I am in complete despair, as I am in total disorientation, but I have a faint hope that one of you will be able to support and / or console me.

Unfortunately, three or four days after this risky maneuver, something suddenly switched in my head: since then, my personality seemed to dissolve without a trace, I stopped experiencing any emotions and enjoying my former hobbies. I just spend the last months in bed without getting out because of anhedonia, amotivation and apathy: it‚Äôs hard for me to mobilize myself just to take a glass of water.

I'm in the midst of a depressive episode that was preceded by a spike in my OCD (which usually causes me to become depressed if it goes on long enough, which then, ironically, causes my OCD to go away because the depression overpowers it). The never ending cycle...sigh. As I'm about to go back on an SSRI, I can't help but think, what if I never took these damn drugs in the first place? Do any of you have any thoughts on this?

Of course, the evidence is far from conclusive, but it irks me more than words can describe that for a lot of us, it feels like our only good option are these drugs, that no one really knows how they work for sure, or even what they're doing to us when taken for long periods of time. I'm fed up.

i have the ocd where i will think for example; if all the lights are off then i will go blind, which leads me to have a panic attack if i can't find a light switch in time, and sometimes i have a need to push buttons like the power button of my laptop while i am in the middle of a project. other stuff too but i'm not entirely sure what is my ocd and what might be something else, but the worst for me is ROCD.

i want love, but i can't stop questioning everything about any partner i meet. like are they the one? what if i am making a mistake? if i tell them what i'm thinking then what if they leave me? or what if i had just said this then would this have gone differently? it's exhausting not only for me but i imagine for them trying to live up to my expectations. currently i am with someone who doesn't seem to know me really well, or maybe just doesn't care. i have mentioned having ocd, have mentioned how much anxiety and overthinking i get when i am ignored, yet he will still sometimes ignore my messages. i feel like the more i talk about how it drives me crazy, i will end up driving him away. i just want to seem normal to people. i'm sorry if that's not the right way to phrase things, but personally i feel like i am trapped in my own head and am crazy but i don't want people to know. i want to seem normal and unbothered but deep down inside i am just being ripped apart and constantly crying, trying not to do it in front of people because they don't understand and i'm just labelled as someone who is too difficult to put up with.

the only times i am okay is when things are going well. when work is good, when my relationship is thriving... i am in a good place. but all it takes is some weeks and shit hits the fan and i can't relax until by some miracle something happens and things are good again. i am simply exhausted from being me. i don't hate my brain all the time, i feel like being this way has made me an empathetic person and i always think about what others may be thinking and feeling, but this is like to an extreme where it might not even be relevant, i don't know, but i can't concentrate on things or relax. i just want to scream and cry but it gets me nowhere and resolves nothing. i'm just tired of this and none of the professionals i have tried to talk to actually seem to listen to me. i get brushed off a lot, and feel even more alone in dealing with this.

tqixee,"SchizOCD, but I might actually have schizophrenia. Weird story I believed in some weird shit 2.5 years ago and I do have OCD. I'm thinking maybe I do actually have the schizophrenia and it's just in remission? I‚Äôll explain.

I had a period of time in my life where I thought the world was really bland and I thought there had to be more to this world. Some time after that I met someone I fell in love with instantly, became obsessed/infatuated and started trying to find them again and stuff. I'd get a strong urge to look at this person and I even felt like the thoughts were coming from somewhere else. I'm also dissociated asf in general, so maybe my own thoughts felt foreign to me as I wasn't used to recogizing them, I have no clue really.

After some months of this I constantly saw 11:11 and felt weirded by the coincidence and googled it. This is how I found the articles and started believing in shit called twin flames and telepathic communication (because that‚Äôs what it wrote online about the concept.) I was very surprised that these things could exist and I just believed in what I read. I thought finally the world wasn‚Äôt so boring, there was this special thing only I knew. I was isolated and lacked insight (and love) for sure. I believed and wanted to believe in it so hard, I doubt I even questioned it.

After knowing this I thought telepathy existed for real and I'd constantly misinterpret my own feelings and would think these feelings were coming from her through telepathy. I believed in most of the things I read online about the topic, but when I looked online into other, different forums, a lot of the stuff would strike me as just crazy and schizophrenic. I‚Äôd refuse to believe those ones since they sounded too crazy/weird.

This weird phase ended when my friend from the forum realized they had somehow created this concept all in their own head because they wanted so desperately to be loved. I resisted it at first but deep down it resonated with me a lot. I never had love, I was deeply, desperately in lack of it, same as that friend. I slowly lost faith in the concept thanks to her and I‚Äôd remind myself that the love feeling in my stomach was not telepathy, because I kept on feeling it. 

I got the same feeling in my stomach with my ex-gf, and it‚Äôs literally the love I feel for them, felt in my own body, but I had misinterpreted those feelings because they feel kinda seperate from me. I'm very dissociative. Even my grief is felt in my stomach, why am I such a disconnected person?

I‚Äôm certain I was using the concept/delusion as a crutch because I severely lacked love, and I thought the world was boring and I wanted it to be more special. Now I have this weird and shameful experience in my life that I kinda repress.

Anyway, I never had a hallucination. Pretty sure I became very depressed and suicidal many times and still didn‚Äôt hallucinate or believe in weird shit. I have bad OCD, and the theme now is obviously about having schizophrenia. I researched a lot. The only possibility is it might be schizophrenia but in remission for 2.5 years. Is this possible? I will see a professional for sure. Is there any way I can test if I have it and maybe it's just in remission? I even got what I assume is false memory OCD over this. I had a recent break-up and I can't even be sure if the stress triggered the schizOCD, or if I got weird thoughts first, which then triggered the OCD. I'm just confused and dissociated.

I believe I could have undiagnosed OCD. I have a had a history of severe anxiety, paranoia, and delusional thinking. I have never really been worried about having schizophrenia. I have a strong family history of bipolar, and some schizophrenia. I'm in my middle-teens.

I hallucinate every so often, when I do, a lot of times it feels like I'm looking through something. Last week, for 3 days I thought my grandmother was a demon, trying to convince me to sell her my soul. I couldn't look anyone in their eyes. Everyone's eyes looked so off. Nobody was human to me for 3 days. Sometimes (not often) I hear people laughing at me, and I've even heard a woman tell me to kill myself. I have never self harmed. 

I was prescribed Abilify, however I cannot take it due to insurance issues, I also, don't want to be made into a zombie. I don't really want my thoughts to be suppressed. I've seen people who aren't there. There was a night when I couldn't look at anything, everything was staring at me. I kept getting laughed at. 

This has been going on since the summer of 2021. I've had severe anxiety since way before then. I've had somewhat of an obsession for the past few years of aligning things I see together. I have to walk along a what is to my sides or I get a lot of self doubt. When I look at anything I have to tap or play a beat to what it looks like. I'm able to look at something and transpose it into some rhythm. 

Every time I get any feeling in my stomach I get so worried, the difference is when I feel like this, I know it's just my thoughts. I can keep feeling and thinking of that feeling in my body or stomach and it makes me so upset. 

I'll answer any and all questions, there is a lot more I'd rather not type out for the sake of no one answering.

For example I had a hard time taking a book about suicide (I'm fine) from the book store because I was worried someone who needed it may go to the bookstore, not find it because I took it, and kills themself.  And it'd be my fault.  Or whenever I see trash on the road I worry it will cause someone to crash.  Even these things don't feel like TOO much of a reach, even though I know most people wouldn't think of it, and I think there's been worse examples that I just can't remember.  It's just making my actions have weight to them that others would consider irrational.

So I'm wondering if anyone else could relate to the butterfly effect metaphor.

I adjusted my pants and went to bed touching things. I woke up and felt my pants elastic and it felt a bit damp. All around.

Like proper wet brown.

I realised, ""wait, That touched my bed, which touched my pillows and sheets, it also touched my mattress and I also adjusted the pants at night and then touched things.

tq1jo9,"Plagiarism OCD when writing fiction Just wanted to vent about this. If you are a writer and can pick compulsions up just from hearing about them, you may want to turn back now.

I keep obsessing about whether or not I‚Äôm ‚Äúplagiarizing‚Äù by using extremely generic things in my stories that were inspired by other stories. For example, I might read a story that includes a young space pirate (random dumb example) and end up later including a young space pirate in one of my own stories because I was inspired by that, and that sort of thing will be enough to make me think ‚Äúoh no, I‚Äôm stealing this idea, this is so morally wrong, what if I published this and profited off this idea that‚Äôs not mine‚Äù. Doesn‚Äôt matter if the stories and the character have very little in common outside of that (although my brain does also try to make me think they‚Äôre more similar than they are).

It‚Äôs gotten to the point where I recently recalled a Reddit comment that referenced *a popular existing work* (in a genre with a lot of stories with similar elements in it) in an interesting context and started thinking about creating a character based in that genre (not even directly based on the work itself!), and *that* turned into ‚Äúoh no, I‚Äôm stealing this random Redditor‚Äôs idea‚Äù. It‚Äôs annoying. I‚Äôm not looking for reassurance or anything, just putting it out there in case anyone else has this, I guess.

tpzjhs,"The REAL problem gets solved only once I'm currently in a compulsion loop, but I noticed that when this loop is just beginning, my brain offers me a totally reasonable problem to solve.   
And I take it.   
It's like bait.   
For example, if my brain is telling me my hands are dirty, I'll wash them. There, that's the one problem based in reality.  But then, many more spin off of it, like is my soap effective? are there germs on the tap's handle? what if I've already gotten myself sick? Cue days worth of research and obsessive hand washing and me trying to google how many germs i think are on the subway.   
And these thoughts seem like they're completely reasonable, but they start to become more and more based in disreality as they place too great an emphasis on total certainty, rather than listening to a genuine fear.  
Currently, I'm having a really hard time distinguishing between genuine fear, what my real solvable problems are, and what I can do to move on.   
(Like, another compulsion I have is reality to digital privacy. This one sucks for me, because I can't distinguish between what i can do to protect myself versus what's out of my control. Because at one point, this was a solvable problem, and now the fear is left behind and it's an obsession).

tq5whw,"What is happening to me ? Hello

Just some resume so you can maybe understand my situation : I'm germaphobic because of some PTSD and I have big anxiety issues. I'm very sensitive and when something has a bad affect, it can trigger very big crisis to me.

For one month now I moved in a student room in a residence.

At first sight the room looked nice and clean. The concierge told me it was a woman before me in this room, so I felt comfortable (I don't say that man are messy, just I feel comfortable feeling that a woman like me was living there, it was just kind of relatable). I was really happy to be there and taking care of the sharing kitchen with my neighbor. Everything was nice.I did a little clean of the ground while arriving, but not a deep cleaning, on wall or other.

Last Thursday I checked up my letterbox for the first time, and there was a letter from the court, in the name of a man, the same name as it was on the letterbox.First I felt awkward like, the surprise it was actually a man and not a girl before me. But I felt also stressed because it was a letter from the penal court, it looked important.

I asked a neighbor the phone number of the last habitant, to warn him I received some stuff from court. The ancien habitant answered like ""just send me picture of it"" and so I did. As I didn't know what was inside the letter, I just joke saying ""I hope you're not a murderer haha"". The man said ""no but I was robbed in your room by a random guy I brought back from party and it appeared he was a big criminal and now he's in jail cause I complained"". So there I was suddenly feeling bad like ""ok there was a robbery in my actual home, feels weird, and maybe the guy would get revenge as he get out of jail ?"" and trying to get over this, I said ""haha as I'm germaphobic I hope he didn't pee everywhere in the room further that"". The man answerd by ""I don't know but for me I vomit everywhere in this room""

There I was starting feeling bad, but I felt ok like ""there must be agency that clean the room before the next inhabitant"". I asked a neighbor like ""furtonately, there is a cleaning before the other person"" and the neighbor said ""no there isn't any cleaning. The last habitant has to clean, and if it looks ok it's ok. Plus, the guy before you, he was a mess, he was doing drug, taking weird people to his home, etc.""

There I was feeling really bad. I asked the guy if he did clean his vomit before living, but well, with soap, disinfectant etc.First he started insulting everyone in the residence group, saying that he was schizophrenic and that he is not responsable of not cleaning well.

After that he told me he cleaned with only water. He also told me that he vomit on the wall, next to the bed, where I slept and sat down on the wall for a month now.

And there I lost it, I didn't feel I was home anymore, I began shivering, crying, shouting because of anxiety, I had to sleep at my neighbor, I passed all the Saturday disinfecting everything, etc but it was not enough. I was feeling really really sick. When I get in the room, my vision is becoming trouble, I don't feel anything in my legs, and I just faint.

I used to feel bad like really bad, but it's the first time that something like that happened to me. I lived in another place before and I know that place have history, and that building have seen a lot of people through year, from the dirtiest to the cleanest, and I had no problem before. Usually I always clean up a bit before moving, but I didn't know that this time, there was a background like that.

Now, even the agency proposed to clean the room with disinfectant and special product, but I still don't feel well like, I can't dissociate the room with what I learned. I don't want to sleep in the bed anymore. I cry all the time I had to go back to my mother's place.

Why am I reacting like that ? Is this normal to feel bad ? Someone compare this situation with ""the buildings where there was murderer and other bad stuff, nobody want to go there because of the affect of the location"" is that some similar thing ?
