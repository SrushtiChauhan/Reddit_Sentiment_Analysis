tx850u,Absolutely not man.  You have to educate yourself on hiv more.  Hiv cannot survive outside the body so u could never catch it like that way.  You're fine,2022-04-06 04:03:21,1

twx61z,"Yes you aren't infected as your doctor told you and a quick search in Internet could easily assure you.

Same search could also tell you that oral sex isn't a risk practice (for HIV).

If you want to be 1000% take a Viral Load and CD4 count cell test, just be sure to pay it for yourself and don't charge it to social security health system (as it isn't a cheap test and it's completely unnecessary).

Oh Dog, I'm getting tired of people wasting tests and PEP just for their anxiety.",2022-04-05 20:29:50,1

twrynv,Some people don’t even have seroconversion symptoms when infected with HIV and some people only have a few and some people have all of them. You just have to buckle up and get tested in 6 weeks and 3 months. Those should give you accurate results,2022-04-05 13:07:50,3

twecrg,I love my wife and she is the most beautiful woman in the world (seriously if you see her google young Zoe Saldaña) I'm not attracted to men whatsoever I just find it crazy how guys will pleasure me with no questions asked. I've had the free urine tests and they've been negative just the hiv part I keep getting talked out of doing by my doctor and 111,2022-04-05 04:29:37,1
twecrg,Hmmm interesting I can’t say I really understand but I hope ur at least having protected sex with her while ur waiting for results… my ex gave me herpes from his escapades and im currently in the middle of a series of HIV tests since I found out how many partners (male) he had outside of our relationship but without any disclosure to me :/ im devastated and have serious emotional problems now how shocking and confusing and scary it all was. I don’t think I’ll ever fully trust a person again and there is a heavy pain in my chest for a long time now. I hope that maybe you can get to the point of honesty with her Bc for me finding it on my own has destroyed me,2022-04-05 04:33:08,1
twecrg,"I am so sorry to hear that, I hope everything goes well for you. I asked my doctor can I go on prep just incase and he said he'd only prescribe me it if I was doing risky stuff like sex. He knows the ins and outs and I rang him during covid as I was worried about hiv and he said there's no point even taking test so I'm in a bit of predicament. I dont want to lie and say I did something risky to get tested because if it did come back poz then oral is a risky one and would change the world of HIV transmission for sure",2022-04-05 04:41:20,1
twecrg,"Well as long as she is okay with you being with men then I guess she knows the risks! I personally think all sexually active people should test at least 1x a year for everything whether it’s from a doctor or planned parenthood or online testing depending on ur resources, I hope you guys are safe and ok though either way",2022-04-05 04:43:03,1

tvxnt7,Ur fine with 3 mnths,2022-04-05 13:14:59,2
tvw4jj,Yeah I went and got tested with it at a clinic after I had a potential exposure. It’s strange some countries say at 28 days it’s conclusive or 6 weeks but where I’m at the guidelines are to retest at 12 weeks.,2022-04-04 07:52:27,1

tvpj1c,Yes definitely too early. Rapid test won’t be conclusive until about 90 days. If you are gonna test that early you would want to do an RNA test. 4th gen test would be ideal at about a month but even then 6 weeks will give you the best idea,2022-04-04 01:34:12,1

The other is a another scenario a month before, where I was bottom without using Prep, and this was with a regular partner. These two are the cases why I am worried. Any thoughts would be helpful, again, the rash is one flaky red spot with a raised bump on my elbow, maybe a bit itchy (on contact).",2022-04-03 22:33:15,1
tv9ynu,Just test. Sounds like most risky exposure was a month ago. A 4th generation blood test will give you close to 100% accuracy at that point. After 6 weeks it’s considered conclusive.

He has already had all reasonable advice provided him, but he persists in posting these ""Do I have HIV?"" posts. The obvious answer being 'Stop asking randos on anonymous boards to diagnose you, and go get tested.'

In r/askgaybros, a person (different screenname than OP here) posted a week ago with a very similar story: low-risk MSM contact; 'I have thrush. Do I have AIDS?' That person sent out somebody else's pics of a dirty mouth (not thrush), to various people who posted in his thread. Then this week the same story was repeated in AGB by the OP of this thread.

You don't get thrush days after an HIV infection. As another in this thread said, it usually takes years before thrush is a sign of HIV. OP has been told this repeatedly, and I note that he is changing his approach to 'There's a bump on my elbow.' 

There's a tell-tale faux-naivete to his posts and replies, as if he has no understanding of HIV, and no memory of the advice he has already received. He just wants to keep the conversation going.

tueirq,"42 days is conclusive, better to re-test 3 months after , for anxiety and 110% sure",2022-04-02 15:47:21,3
tueirq,The common thought process here is to get a baseline test around 3-4 weeks. Test again after 6 weeks for conclusive and then one more time after 3 mths to make absolutely sure. But the 6 week test results is very very unlikely to change.,2022-04-02 22:53:13,3
tueirq,"It’s 6 months for conclusive, but 90 days means you almost certainly don’t have it (97-99%) don’t",2022-04-03 04:56:17,1
tueirq,I also read that no one has shown a false negative at 6 weeks. So it’s probably 99.999999% accurate,2022-04-03 20:48:22,3
tueirq,Don’t listen to this guy. It hasn’t been 6 mths since the 90’s,2022-04-03 15:13:08,3
tueirq,Retest at 84 days (12 weeks ) or 90 (3 months)?,2022-04-03 22:25:50,1
tueirq,"It’s the same. We use 3 mths because it’s easier to remember than 84 days. But the results aren’t going to change from 84 days to 90 days. 

Most seroconvert around 14 days and at that point many test positive for hiv as the 4th gen test is also testing for the antigen component which are the particles of the virus. Those are present around 2 weeks and peak around 4 weeks after which they are then binding to the antibodies your body behind producing in an effort to combat the foreign virus. Which by then would make the antibody component of the test be positive. That happens around 4 weeks but some may take 6 weeks which is why most countries consider the test to be conclusive any time after 6 weeks or 42 days. 

So 3 mths is just to reinforce the 6 weeks test and provide peace of mind. If you don’t test positive by 3 mths it’s because you don’t have Hiv.",2022-04-03 22:47:14,2

tty40w,RNA tests aren’t suppose to be used to diagnose long standing infections unless there is a high suspicion that an individual cannot make antibodies to HIV infection.

ttoya5,Yeah i read that up online too but for some reason my doctor says it’s not conclusive until 12 weeks so it’s just stressing me out,2022-04-02 01:44:16,1
ttoya5,and how it will help you with your anxiety to retest after 60 days when your dr told you that you dont have?,2022-04-01 13:47:36,1
ttoya5,At 6 weeks it’s 99% conclusive and at 12 weeks 100% so technically your doctor is right. But 95% conclusive is more then good. You should stop worrying,2022-04-02 01:46:05,2
ttoya5,It’s just cos it says you have to re test at 3 months everywhere and honestly I feel like the fact that my condom got tore just added to my anxiety but my anxiety will be gone after the next test when my doctor says it’s negative.,2022-04-01 13:50:12,1

ttddgr,"Hey! Hope you’re doing fine. To answer your question no you shouldn’t be worried about it. After medication your CD4 count should be going up not down and it happens much faster than you’d think. They will do a blood evaluation in about three months to check if you’re on the right ART medication (because I’m sure you know there are several and they work differently for some people) and I’m sure you’ll see that youre on the right track! On the slim chance that it’s not working they’ll ask about the side effects if you’ve had any and change your meds to another one that’s suitable for you. Meanwhile you should be eating healthy and taking food care of yourself, I would recommend not smoking or drinking for a while. Read about stories from PLWH and watch movies were they have the right representation, I personally really liked POSE. And remember to take good care of your mental health!

tqjzpb,3 months is accurate and conclusive.,2022-03-30 14:06:22,1
tqjzpb,"That's a very important thing to know. 

There are a lot of numbers thrown around, but in summary the HIV 1 & 2 Antibody (4th Gen) Test is considered to be around 98-99% accurate 28 days. 

The HIV RNA test is considered to be 90 - 95% accurate at 11 days, and 99% at 28 days. 

Some sites say 6 months is the number for 100% accuracy for the HIV 1 & 2 Antibody (4th Gen) Test, while others say 3 months, and even others say 6 weeks. I found some UK and Singapore sites that say it's conclusive at 28 days. For the HIV RNA, anytime from 28 days on is supposedly 99 percent accurate. 

A negative at 18 days is great news (especially if it's the HIV RNA). Getting tested again at 28 days is probably a good idea for further confirmation. A 28 day negative, combined with your 18 day negative, is probably definitive. 

If you, like me, are eaten up by worry. you could do another test at 42 days. A negative here and you're 99.999 in the clear.",2022-03-30 14:23:24,2

tqirz3,You say you study medicine and Anatomy and still asking this ridiculous question.  This is beyond me.  This is gotta be some type of joke lol.  The answer is no.

tqirz3,"So I know everyone is being a dick to you in the comments, but since you’re 15 and most 15 year olds are ignorant (I know I was) I’ll give you a few pieces of helpful information. 

For starters, HIV isn’t transmitted through saliva. It’s only through blood, sexual fluids and breast milk. So you probably can guess how these would be transmitted. Sharing a vape unless your mom is bleeding blood like her tongue got cut  off the chances are zero.

Second, if your mom is taking her HIV medicine known as ART (antiretroviral therapy) and has an undetectable viral load. There is no way she can pass on HIV to anybody, zero chance. So good news is that’s probably the case and you have nothing to worry about it.
I hope you don’t make your mom feel like some kind of weird mutant where touching her can infect you, HIV is heavily stigmatized and it’s probably the second hardest aspect of dealing with the disease. Read up more on how it’s transmitted, so you can fight the stigma. 

Anyways I hope this helped relieve some anxiety!",2022-03-29 05:54:38,0

My father has AIDS but I don't live with him since I was 6 cuz my mom kicked him out, and yeah I'm traumatized, cuz he sometimes would threaten me and my mom, ( before we found out her diagnosis) that he would put blood on out door handle and other shit.......hes just gross....

tq87m6,"What test did you do? And how long after potential exposure? (never mind, saw 17 days)

The HIV RNA test is rated 90-95% accurate (sources vary) after 11 days (9-11 is the actual range) and 99 percent accurate at 28 days. 

The HIV 1 & 2 Antibody (4th Gen) Test is rated 99 percent after 42 days. 

> Newer antigen/antibody combination tests (you might hear them called “fourth generation” tests) can find HIV in 99% of people who are tested within 13 to 42 days of exposure

So I would say if you've done the HIV RNA at 28 days or the HIV 1 & 2 Antibody (4th Gen) Test after 42 days and are clear, then you are good.

If no then you are fine it is not HIV. 

HIV is very hard to contract from a woman that is just facts.

Get tested make sure you test at the right time. 

3 months for a conclusive HIV test.",2022-03-19 14:56:59,1

tg1isb,"Since you’re clearly a retard and can’t read, I’ll link two sources who don’t say that 3 months is conclusive. 

First is WebMD which is reviewed by doctors before it’s published. 

https://www.webmd.com/hiv-aids/hiv-window-period

Quote: “Antibody tests, which look for the antibodies -- special proteins that help fight infection -- that your body makes in reaction to an HIV infection. Most rapid tests and at-home tests are these kind. Antibody tests require the longest wait time after infection to get an accurate result. For most people -- around 97% -- this takes anywhere from 2 to 12 weeks. For some, it can take as long as 6 months.”

Or Planned Parenthood, Quote: “It usually takes about 3 months for your body to make enough antibodies to show up on an HIV test, but it could be even longer. This time after you first get infected but won’t test positive for HIV is called the “window period.””

See how these two sources don’t say anything about 3 months being ConClusive, Captain Porch Monkey? It can sometimes take longer than 3 months. 3 months is a very very good sign you’re not infected, but not everybody’s immune system is the same. Also the CDC doesn’t ever use the word “conclusive” it says “can usually detect” in case you haven’t noticed what that means, it means that it’s not definitive until you repeat the test after a certain period. Most doctors will say 6 months to be considered conclusive, but 6 weeks and 3 months is the usual standard people will seroconvert. Big difference but I’m glad to be able to  break it down for your pea-sized brain.",2022-03-18 22:00:20,0

At this point I don’t see a reason for you to get tested. However, if you develop more symptoms definitely go in. Or get tested now for peace of mind… there’s really no downside. You should definitely be detectable by now if you do have it.",2022-03-13 18:54:55,1

I was showing severe symptoms by then though. 18-45 days is considered typical, so I hope they do an RNA test on you.

tcz0t2,"Okay so they are doing both an antigen and RNA test which is great. With that information, I take back what I said before, I would be confident when you receive your results. It’s typical for HIV tests to take longer btw. The RNA test will probably take the longest.

From what I have read, early HIV symptoms can be mild at first and even mistaken as the flu. However, from personal experience and the experiences of those I know with HIV, this was the worst and longest illness of my life (granted I am pretty young). They are flu-like symptoms, just much more severe for me. It started with a rash and thrush in my throat. I had 103-106 degree fevers for a full week where I did not eat a single thing. I and the few people I know all went to the ER at some point. The fevers continued for 2.5 weeks in total and I felt heavy fatigue until the meds started kicking in. Obviously, the personal experience of three people is not indicative of everyone’s experience, but I have always been very fit and my doctor has commented on my phenomenal health. So if it did that to me, I’m surprised that it could be so mild for others. Regardless, I trust the scientific literature on this. 

Tell me your results when you get them if you’re comfortable. I hope you get good news. Free free to ask any other questions. 

Have you gotten treatment for the other STDs yet?",2022-03-13 20:11:45,1
tcz0t2,"Took blood probably 11-15 days after exposure, got positive results 4 days later. Didn’t even show up on the antibody/antigen tests at first. It took the RNA test to show a positive.

tcz0t2,"I haven't had a fever as of now. I tend to get pretty sick going back to like 7th grade. I had a nasty case of bronchitis and whenever I get a cold/flu, it tends to last for a month at minimum it seems. I actually wonder if maybe I had contracted one of the two STDs I tested positive for earlier. Back in 2019, I remember my previous GP saying I had an unusually high white blood count, but I didn't really have any other symptoms, so he just figured it might be down to stress. I don't know much medical stuff, but a quick glance seems like higher WBC means a possible infection of some kind. It would be crazy if I had an STD for that long and didn't know about it. This would be the third guy I've done unprotected sex with. The first two were on prep and one even showed me his prep bottle, which I thought was interesting but sweet. All other times I've insisted on a condom. For that reason, I've never done a full STI screening until now. I'm very inexperienced for my age. It would suck if the 2-3 minutes he went in bare resulted in an infection, but I know it happens.

tcz0t2,"Well I’m glad you haven’t had any HIV symptoms. There could be a chance you contracted them much earlier. I definitely know chlamydia can lie dormant for years without you knowing. Gonorrhea less so, but still for a long time. Elevated WBC can for sure indicate some sort of infection. Not HIV though: it attacks CD4 cells which are a type of T cell, and T cells are the white blood cells that attack foreign particles. So at least we know you didn’t have that at the time. 

I know what you’re feeling. I always talked about sexual health and used condoms unless my partner was insistent on doing it raw. Most were on PrEP. Well it wasn’t enough. Probably 7 partners in total with precautions and it still happened. So don’t beat yourself up. The infections you have are curable, and in the slight chance you have HIV, it’s easily treatable with no side effects. Probably for the best that you’re waiting for all the results to contact your doctor. The treatments are just some antibiotics for a couple weeks. Or you can take a shot in the hip for gonorrhea. Super easy. Hope the best for your HIV test.",2022-03-14 04:03:49,1

She said to go into the clinic for an antibiotic (I'm guessing the shot) and then start a 7-day course of antibiotics before having any intercourse again. If I did happen to test positive, would she be making that recommendation to have sex so soon? I would imagine she must have access to some of the results by now even if I don't.",2022-03-15 19:33:28,1
tcz0t2,"Yes the antibiotic would be for the gonorrhea I’m guessing. And if she’s telling you to take a medication for a week that would be for Chlamydia. I always thought you should wait one week after medication is done to have sex. I know I waited one week after the shot. 

I feel like you would have gotten the results by now. How many days has it been since they took your blood? I can’t imagine it would take more than a week. Do your results just have nothing on them right now?",2022-03-15 21:28:12,1
tcz0t2,"Let me check. It sounded like what you said (a shot) if I had to go to the nurse clinic to get it. She prescribed Ceftriaxone and then a 7 day course of Doxycycline. Finally she made the recommendation of not having any intercourse for the week of treatment. I'm just a little anxious still because she made no mention of the HIV result. Like I want to think she knows at least one of the test results and that it just hasn't updated on my end.

They took my blood just after noon on Friday, so it's been 3 days. The results just show up on my online portal when they are ready. The two different HIV tests she ordered are the only ones that haven't shown up yet. I just thought that maybe she might know the results if she's saying I could have sex again.

I doubt she knows the results and if she did, they would obviously be negative. I wouldn’t over-analyze what she said about having sex. You’ll know your HIV results by the end of the week anyway.

All of the other tests are usually automatically made available to me as they are charted. It said nonreactive for antigen and antibody. I'm not sure if those are the two exact tests you mentioned. I asked her about when I might be able to re-test and confirm the result so I can maybe go on PrEP as this whole scare really worried me. But first I have to treat the other STDs and I'll definitely abstain until I find out about the PrEP.

I’m sorry that happened to you. I had a similar situation and it’s considered to be SA as we didn’t consent to condom-less sex. It hasn’t affected me or caused me trauma or anything but still shitty to do.",2022-03-16 04:28:03,1
tcz0t2,"I'd definitely like to double check to be sure. It had only been about 15 days (I think) when they took my blood. I asked my doc when she suggest I try for a re-test. I also want to check with my main provider in case there might be any kind of interactions with my other BP med or if they need to check my liver again or something.

It was pretty messed up. It's not often you hear about a younger guy assaulting an older one (him being 21 and me 27), but after years of watching Law & Order: SVU, I should know that anybody can be an abuser. It did traumatize me a little because I didn't even know it had happened. The video is also why I was so confident about the duration of the encounter. He took the condom off at the 5:00 mark and the video was over at around 8 minutes when I asked him to stop because of the blood.

tcabqh,"But then I totally don't get this, why the sudden symptoms? Fever and sore throat at the third week",2022-03-12 12:31:10,1
tcabqh,Yes i will get tested but does the condom break when it's on non erect penis and we insert the penis anyhow into the vagina?,2022-03-17 04:46:29,1
tcabqh,"bcs you are worrying like an idiot, and your fear manipulated your brain to cause the symptoms",2022-03-12 12:43:37,2
tcabqh,"No it won't break but you're gonna have a hard time inserting it as it's not erect. And since your penis is not erected, the condom would absolutely not break as it's not stretched out (though still uncommon that it would break if it's stretched out)",2022-03-17 10:08:04,1
tcabqh,Are you hiv positive?,2022-03-16 14:06:58,1
tcabqh,Yes indeed I was having a hard time inserting it so i made her sit on me and stretched the condom so that it gets inserted but still ater some seconds Tye penis became more soft and it exited from hers and I looked at the condom it didn't slip and I don't remeber seeing the condom broke,2022-03-17 10:24:56,1
tcabqh,me? no,2022-03-16 14:08:08,1
tcabqh,Pretty sure it won't break especially when the condom isn't stretched out too much. If you used an oil-based lubricant then that'd increase the chance of breaking which I believe you didn't use. Are you new to sex may I ask? I believe everyone knows this and that the actual way to fully insert it is to make your penis fully erect first so it won't slip out.,2022-03-17 11:07:36,1
tcabqh,You had any risky exposure? Don't mind just curious to know,2022-03-16 14:57:52,1
tcabqh,The lube was already there on the condom. Yes kinda new to sex but also I knew that it should be erect. Is there any risk if it the dick slips out?,2022-03-17 11:13:47,1
tcabqh,"yeah, i had, i banged with multiple ppl from grindr, rn, i'd just suck random men from grindr, this way i cant get hiv as i wouldnt perform oral sex if i have any injury or scar in my mouth,throat and lips",2022-03-16 14:59:43,1

tcabqh,"Don't mind me asking this to you one last time, i tried to insert my penis into that prostitutes vagina when my penis wasn't erect as I was stressed. I somehow made it semi erect and then pushed it into her, as my dick became more softer I had to back off and but saw the condom was there. And while trying for the second time again same it wasn't erect so i made to sit her on me and inserted that semi erect penis into her and she started sliding forward 3-4 times. And again bcoz my dick became soft it automatically exited from the vagina and while she was still sliding she was on my dick but when she got up I saw the condom was there but maybe half the dick covered but it was there. Now is it possible that it might have slipped inside as my dick was non erect or the virus would have entered the small cut which i had a day before due to trimming? I have no other symptoms other than the throat and red bumps on the back of my tongue and fever on and off",2022-03-16 15:07:40,1

tc3fgw,3rd gen tests are conclusive by 8 weeks. 4th gen by 6 weeks. You are good.,2022-03-12 00:01:06,3
tc3fgw,From what I hear it’s possible but very low chance. I’m in same boat I took 4th gen at 6 an 7 weeks and I’m still worried,2022-03-11 23:48:10,2
tc3fgw,"How did your worry start? I will tell you my experience. Randomly one night I remembered a risky thing i did with a former partner, what was it? I fingered her. Yes, you might say that's stupid and not worth a test. But I made the mistake of licking my finger afterwards and vaginal fluids are a way HIV can be transmitted. So I had a 4th gen test done at about 2-3 months after the exposure (do not remember the date quite well but I know it was kn that range) and it came non-reactive. If you're like me, you'll probably never find your conclusive result. I'm deeply anxious and always thinking of retesting. Plus, get into the internet and read conflicting info and you'll only get worse. My advice, from an health anxious fellow to another, if you want to retest, do it. But maybe what you should be checking is your health awareness overall. Today is HIV, tomorrow can be another deadlier disease.",2022-03-12 16:12:52,2

tb4xy1,"You're doing a great job being a friend 💛

When my friend E shared that to us, we were at his house eating takeout. Our orders were fried chicken and a sort of jerky with rice, and the plastic utensils literally weren't going to cut it, so I asked for his silverware.

He brought two sets for me and my other friend D, who kept declining to use the silverware even when insisted. E asked, ""Why? Are you disgusted with me now?""

D was quiet, and managed to squeak, ""Am I going to be infected?""

All this to say: educate yourself and be mindful of their feelings (but avoid being patronizing too because the last thing they want is getting all the attention).

Let them know you're there for them. If they need a companion for checkups and such, If they need help looking for resources, if they need an accountability buddy (for eating healthy and exercising, for example), that they can call you.

tb4xy1,"Kudos to you.

I was just diagnosed a few days ago. I think you should do your best to educate yourself. Both on the medical and historical aspects of the virus. HIV carries a lot of social stigma and it’s good to know why. 

Personally, I like when people ask me questions about HIV though I understand if some people feel uncomfortable with that. Simply ask them, would you like to talk about your diagnosis? And respond to their answer accordingly.

If they’re currently ill, bringing them a little soup or something couldn’t hurt haha.

If you want to go above and beyond, educating others on the virus and condemning rude comments to help erase the stigma is great😁",2022-03-11 09:44:01,1
tb4xy1,"I believe there’s opportunities to volunteer at clinics. Especially relevant if you have any medical/counseling credentials. I believe the Ryan White Care Council accepts volunteers too. 

On a social level, education is huge. The stigma from the 80s has not left, and there have been great medical strides within the last decade or so. Help people understand that undetectable folks pose exactly the same risk of transmitting the virus as someone without HIV… zero!

There’s probably wayyyy more you can do on a medical level in Central/South Africa where people are still dying from the virus. Probably not super feasible for you but something I’ve considered so thought I would mention it.",2022-03-13 19:24:19,1

You don't have HIV only if you haven't had others risky sex activity BEFORE this blowjob and AFTER. In this case, your chances of getting hiv almost zero. HIV is not easily transmitted virus. Don't forget about list of others sti's which could be easily transmitted through oral sex. I don't know what are you waiting for. Go to a clinic and get tested for HIV. You will not find your results in the internet or in reddit. The only way is get tested. After your HIV negative, get tested for syphilis and ask a doctor what to do.",2022-03-10 17:15:24,1

There is no documented cases of hiv transmission for insertive partner (oral sex). There is alot of concentration of HIV in blood/body fluids, in your case, in semen(ejaculation) or pre-ejaculation. If he finished in your mouth and you have open sores, open cuts in your mouth, then you have more chances of getting hiv. There is a little risk and I think you didn't get it.

But i digress.

If it's been three months and you tested negative conclusively and haven't been sexually active or otherwise engaged in risky behavior, it's unlikely that you have HIV.

Just be safe. The acute stage of HIV is miserable and the antiretroviral medication is outrageously expensive. Without insurance I'd be paying $4300/month.",2022-03-10 02:31:12,4

t64tvx,I really agree with this post.  Alot of people are so paranoid they'd rather ask strangers over their own doctors and trust what we say over the actual doctor that has ur blood results lol.  Guys and girls if your main concern is every std other than hiv get it tested after a week or 2 after exposure if you had unprotected.  If protected and condom didn't break chances are you're absolutely fine.  If it's hiv you're mainly worried about wait 40 to 90 days get tested and if it's negative you are fine trust me.  No need for 100 tests and continue to tell ur self that you have the symptoms of hiv.  You don't. They're sickness out there far worst than hiv and that's what you might be experiencing.,2022-03-04 06:33:30,2

What you can do to ease your level of risk going forward (if you will start having anal sex) is getting on PrEP. I think it’s also good practice to exchange written STD results prior to sex and to always use condoms. I tell people all the time not to just trust someone’s word they don’t have a STD.

t1fp7s,I'm going to tell you what to do. Stop convincing yourself you have HIV. Repeat after me I'm human and we all make mistakes. This is why pencils come with erasers. I do not deserve HIV for my mistakes. Sounds like 90% of the other people that come here. You're getting eaten up by your Conscious not a deadly virus. If the test said negative move along. Retest in 3 months to clear your mind. Worrying isn't going to change anything if you have it or not. Let's say you do have it how would Worrying about it change a thing? Can a short person worry themselves a foot taller? Take it as a lesson learned and be thankful that we don't get always get our punishments as we deserve. If you're religious just remember Jesus took those punishments for you. Yea in the back of you mind you're going to have a what if for awhile but once you stop worrying everything will clear up. Trust the test I mean why even go get tested if you don't trust the results? Remember these tested are used on millions of people and have been perfected for years. Trust the results I mean if it said positive you would trust the doctors to treat you correct?,2022-02-25 23:18:04,3
t1fp7s,talk to a shrink or a therapist,2022-02-25 22:18:55,2
t1fp7s,"These tests are highly sensitive after 6 weeks. They are the most accurate tests in modern medicine. 

If you had a negative strep test would you obsess over those results despite multiple results? Of course not.",2022-02-26 00:00:12,2

And get free",2022-03-02 03:57:11,1

t1fp7s,I may need to but I still really think I might have it.,2022-02-25 22:30:55,-1
t1fp7s,No your right but when I tested it was just a couple of days after I hit 6 week mark and it was just an antibody test but it was blood test from vain from the lab at my doctors office.,2022-02-26 00:20:20,1
t1fp7s,Maybe I am overthinking but I have a bad feeling.,2022-02-26 00:21:53,1
t1fp7s,I been tested prolly that many times already. All been non reactive. I’m gonna get tested again at 90 days though to be 100% sure.,2022-03-02 11:28:06,1
t1fp7s,I understand but at some point you have to realize that no matter what happens you'll be okay. When crossing through fire you will burn but after jumping out you'll be cooled. You're in fire now and its about time you've crossed out.  In case you don't understand the fire is worry and you need to leave the worry .Life is full of challenges  and this is just one of yours. Your challenge is to over come your fear. Looks like what ever lesson you needed to learn has been learned now move along with your life as Christ told the woman go sin no more same goes for you.,2022-02-25 23:33:34,2
t1fp7s,any updates,2022-04-04 02:07:07,1
t1fp7s,I have learned my lesson I’m just hoping I don’t have to deal with a disease for the rest of my life for one stupid mistake I made. I realize I can’t change it but I pray that god will give me another chance to prove to him that I can be a better person an not make the same mistake.,2022-02-25 23:58:42,2

t0blvx,This happened February 17th and the symptoms I listed that I’ve experienced are also symptoms for strep throat so I think it could be that? I also heard that it’s a 0.04% chance that you can get hiv from oral from someone who has it,2022-02-24 16:20:52,1
t0blvx,[deleted],2022-02-24 16:43:59,1
t0blvx,No it’s much lower than 0.04%. It’s almost non Existent. 0.04% is the likelihood of getting HIV from penis in vagina sex.,2022-02-24 21:15:32,1
t0blvx,I definitely will thank you so much this made me feel better. I will still be getting tested. :) and I will ask for prep as well! Thank you so much!,2022-02-24 16:44:56,1
syw740,"You are negative. The body would’ve produced antibodies by 6 weeks and even if it didn’t (it does) then the Antigen component of the test would’ve shown positive. Antigen is present until about 4 weeks when it then binds to the antibodies produced by your body. 

So it’s physiologically impossible for a 4th gen test to not be conclusive 6 weeks or more (and many experts say from 4 weeks on) from your exposure. 

So relax.",2022-02-23 02:20:32,2
syw740,What testing facility did you use because I did the same thing. I used stdcheck.com an got blood drawn from lab corp.  an both were non reactive but I’m having all symptoms as well. Just went today to get tested by my doctor an waiting on results an I’m so afraid.,2022-02-22 23:12:39,1
syw740,"Definitely go to your doctor, but that doesn’t seem like HIV. A negative RNA test and Ag/Ab test are pretty conclusive.",2022-02-23 03:11:43,1
syw740,Probably covid,2022-02-23 17:35:26,1
syw740,"I found this because i searched the word Thrush.

Had Covid over a year ago and thrush slowly formed over the year. Doctors gaslit me the whole time until they finally did a test. Came back positive for Candida Dublienesis so I also had to get an HIV test, which came back negative.

Doesn't really answer your question. But it seems related to covid and whatever it does.",2022-02-24 16:30:21,1
syw740,Did you test for Gonorhea and Chlamydia? You need to test urine for those. You also can get oral STDs. You need to do a oral swab. They can give you thrush issues,2022-03-05 20:52:12,1
syw740,"Hello I'm in a somewhat similar situation, possible exposure september and I got 4th generation ab/ag done in december, it was non reactive

syw740,Yes I used STDcheck.com it’s legit tho.. bro I honestly think I got it bruh .,2022-02-23 01:32:02,1
syw740,I get all my test there done always. Pretty accurate.,2022-02-25 05:45:49,1

syw740,I did have COVID like a month ago,2022-02-23 21:39:38,1

syw740,Still nothing yet I just did a 4th generation hiv test at 84 days/12 weeks it’s still non reactive but symptoms still persists. About you?,2022-03-30 13:46:18,1
syw740,What are your symptoms?,2022-03-31 00:29:32,1
syw740,Those aren’t even hiv symptoms. And symptoms typically hit after 2 weeks and then you remain symptom free for years. It’s not hiv.,2022-02-23 03:03:49,2
syw740,Well if that website is legit an those test are accurate than we should be good but I’m in the same boat as you. I have fully convinced myself I have it. Scared asf dude.,2022-02-23 02:19:14,1
syw740,I would hope so man cuz I’ve gotten so many non reactive test back that I want to believe I don’t have HIV but I’m having all the symptoms and it is really scaring me.,2022-02-25 15:18:30,1
syw740,The only thing that would make me think I don’t is I guess a non reactive test at 3 months but I still have a whole month to make it through before I hit the 3 month mark so it’s just gonna be worry until then.,2022-02-25 15:19:12,1
syw740,"An acute HIV infection usually presents with fever, body rash, swollen lymph nodes (particularly in the neck), fatigue, headache, GI upset. Some people get a few symptoms, some don’t get any at all. Also, symptoms usually don’t last for a month in the acute phase.

Thrush is also not very common in the first stage of HIV infection as well. 

The main reason why it seems to be something else is because both your test are negative. A negative RNA test after 30 days is pretty sensitive. Ab/Ag tests (the generation tests) vary in their window, but I would say yours is okay. 

So I’m pretty certain it’s not HIV, but you definitely should get checked for whatever else you’ve got.",2022-02-23 03:22:30,1

You will have definitive results back within a few days typically. Those tests are the gold standard and completely conclusive anytime 6 weeks or more from the time of the exposure you are concerned about.

My initial VL was beyond the test limit of 10,500,000 copies. So I had a LOT of virus in me .. which means I probably got it from a highly infective person and then I was tested at my peak.
They did not mention it being early detection but an RNA (PCR) is the only way to conclusively know early. It is detecting actual pieces of the virus. Rarely a false positive. All this according to my DRs.",2022-02-19 21:09:11,2

I guess either I'm very very unlucky, and genuinely did catch it from giving/receiving oral, or I'm forgetting a broken condom or two, over the years!

* I got it from oral.
* Or despite always having safe-sex there was an accident (broken condom) sometime in the past year or two which I've just genuinely forgotten.

  
I had the interview with the nurse and she said ""Do you have any symptoms?"" and I said, quite honestly, ""If I had flu-like symptoms for a week that went away, even with swollen nodes .. I'd not remember a month later"".  I'd certainly not think ""Ooh STD""",2022-02-20 08:21:07,1

I might have had an accident over the years, but I genuinely can't rememeber any.

ssgwpo,"Well, it is nearly impossible to contract HIV from receiving oral sex, even if you had a cut. In order for you to have been infected: 

-She would have to be infected with HIV and not on ART (medicine that lowers the HIV viral load).

-She would have to be bleeding profusely from the mouth while your penis had an open wound on it.

-The enzymes in saliva kill HIV, making this extremely difficult (nearly impossible) to happen.

Be careful who you mess around with, use protection, get on PrEP, get tested regularly and insist that your potential partners do the same and you'll be alright. I was stupid and thought it would never happen to me, and then it did.

The rash the fever the lymph can be for any other microorganism who's more easy to catch than hiv. And third: single oral contact are not an effective way to transmit HIV. I have more probability to marry Anya Taylor Joy that you of be infected.,2022-02-11 15:42:21,2

sq10a2,I just got my results today 2/14 and it was negative. It wasn’t a NAT test because the clinic didn’t use the correct testing tube so they did a 4th generation antigen/antibody test. I’m getting the NAT test tomorrow with the correct tube. How accurate is the 4th generation test after 31 days of exposure? Idk if it was an elisa 4th generation tho,2022-02-15 04:01:17,1

sp87yu,Go to the official CDC website. They have a calculator that assess the exposure risk. From everything I've read getting it from oral Is incredibly rare. To add to that getting it from heterosexual contact is also incredibly rare. If you still freaking out and live in the US you could get tested within 10 days with a HIV RNA test and get decently accurate results. I used the website STDCHECK.com. Overall try not to worry yourself the chances of HIV in your case is near to none. So many people freak out and let anxiety rule them and amazingly your mind can send your body into a weird place. Alot of people come here scared for HIV even tho the encounter was not high risk. Thus I believe this is due to guilt. Everyone has a conscious whether we like it or not we do stuff and somewhere in the back of our mind it makes us worry due to guilt. Just repeat after me you are human and you make mistakes no you don't deserve HIV due to those mistakes. With all that said I wouldn't rule out other infections .,2022-02-10 22:52:14,1

sp87yu,Anxiety is such a b*cth even if u  broke your arm you will thinking is because hiv. Another std (curable) can be transmitted by a single oral contact and can explain those symptoms. But men if that let you sleep i bet you 1.000 that u don't have hiv,2022-02-10 18:55:53,1

In fact, those tests are 100% accurate anytime 6 weeks + after the exposure. 

Furthermore, It is not physiologically possible for a human to not produce antibodies at that point nor would it be possible for the antigen (particles of HIV virus present) component of the test to indicate negative if in fact there were antigen present (the antigen peaks around 4 weeks and then binds to the antibodies, so the 4th gen test is designed to provide an indication of negative/positive as early as 4 weeks and certainly after 6 weeks).

I have been given the PEP medications and have taken the first dose. 

I began the treatment about 50 hours after the potential exposure. Do you all believe this is early enough to prevent HIV from staying in my bed?

Today I spent time reading research about PEP patients, and was excited to read in one study about a PEP clinic in Canada that all patients who reduced their risky behavior, regularly and successfully took their medicine, did not become seropositive. This gave me hope that in case I was exposed, I made a good decision. 

However, I am still curious about the 72 period. I waited about 50 hours, and am concerned about what could have happened within that time….does anyone know about the difference between waiting less than 24 hours, vs closer to 72?

Were you alive during the 1970s and 1980s or 1990s? Not every single bisexual and gay man who got infected with HIV, got infected with HIV from only anal sex. I know several men who were infected from giving oral sex. They were infected with HIV this way as they were not into anal sex and did not do it, or the very small number of times they did anal sex they were giver/aktiv/top and condoms were used correctly and always.

Getting oral sex is super low risk but it has happened that way when someone has a cut or broken skin on their genitals, or if they have herpes or HPV and the person giving them oral sex is HIV+. HIV infection from oral sex generally happens from someone giving oral sex, and usually swallowing cum or taking cum in the mouth, and they have a cut or sore or broken skin in their mouth.

sn216c,"I’m pretty sure that I had read in a few places there weren’t any documented cases of oral. Period. As it was near impossible to isolate an incidence since people are more likely to also have been engaging In Other activities. 

I did come across this in my quick search right now, which would mean I was definitely incorrect. - “Because condomless fellatio allows body fluids from one person to come into contact with the mucosal tissues or open cuts, sores or breaks in the skin of the other person, there is a “theoretical risk” of HIV transmission—meaning that passing an infection from one person to another is considered possible. But the likelihood of it happening is rare, as there are only a few documented cases.

These cases all involved MSM who were giving condomless oral sex to HIV-positive men. No cases of HIV transmission have been reported among female partners giving condomless oral sex. And there hasn’t been a single documented case of transmission to a partner getting condomless oral sex, either among MSM or heterosexuals.” [(CATIE)](https://www.poz.com/basics/hiv-basics/hiv-transmission-risks)

sn216c,"Yes there have been cases where someone got Pozzed from giving oral sex to someone who is HIV+ or living with AIDS.  I know men who became Poz this way and their HIV or infectious disease doctors confirmed they were infected from giving oral, as these men were monogamous with a guy who is Poz, and they only did oral sex.  There are cases where someone got Pozzed from getting oral a friend became Poz from being sucked as the man sucking him off in a sex bar cut my friend's cock with his teeth and my friend got Pozzed from having a cut or broken skin.  I know men who were picky and they only sucked cock at a sauna and did it to just one guy that night or day who was their type and got Pozzed from sucking cock.

Science and medicine, as well as studying HIV for decades with people's real life experiences with the way they became HIV+ tells us that while giving oral sex is low risk for HIV it is not zero percent or less than 1%, and it is more actually like 5%.

There is a massive amount of misinformation about HIV being spread here on reddit. I have read people writing about how it is in their personal opinion 'very rare or impossible for anyone to be infected with HIV from giving oral sex or that HIV infection from a Poz woman to a neg man having unsafe sex, or a neg man having unsafe sex a Poz bottom simply cannot happen from a single sexual encounter'. When in reality tops who fuck women or men unsafe do get Pozzed, and so do people who are or were neg give oral to people who are poz. Is it at the rate bottoms and women and IV drug users get Pozzed, of course not but that does not mean that it is statistically impossible, improbable, or rare to get HIV from giving oral sex, from woman to man, or from bottom/passiv to top/giver.",2022-02-10 23:16:16,1

slzom1,"I was like that about 3 months ago. Had unprotected sex. Then started feeling some weird twitching/vibrations between my testicles. It was mad weird, I thought the worse. My anxiety went through the roof. Talk about thinking about it almost all day and night. I'm very laid back and chill. Never had that type of anxiety in my life. The twitching later on spread to my arms, legs and other parts of my body that never had twitching before. Once again, I thought the worse. Got tested 1 month after exposure with 4gen and it was negative. That wasn't enough for me. I paid out of pocket for a whole std package, including fast highly accurate hiv test after 2 months of first test. It was also negative. Then, I slowly started to lower my anxiety levels. The twitching in my balls dramatically decrease, but still have it a lot a lot less. 
Anxiety can do a lot of physiological damage. 
To make matters worse, my body was stuck in a fight or flight state afterwards. I guess my subconscious mind still was traumatized, like I was having PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder).
I would wake up at the middle of the night with a little of a fast pulse. I felt like I never went to sleep. I was having this episodes about 4-5 nights in a row. I got sleep deprived, I started shaking.
I'm telling you, Anxiety is no joke. Specifically high levels.

What did I learned ? If you are going to bang someone that is not your regular sexual partner, use  protection. Nothing like banging raw yeah i know, but is it really worth it??? I don't think so. I won't do something that stupid again.

shygru,I suggest you go for another 4th gen duo test just to ease your mind. If it's negative which has a window period of 43 days you are good. Chances are still almost zero it would come back positive. Regardless of what anyone says no one test negative at 3 months and then positive at 6 months. The CDC which is an extremely conservative organization suggest 3 months while most countries suggest 6 weeks for the 4th gen duo test.,2022-02-03 03:42:20,1

shnveo,"HIV infection is dependent on a factor known as viral load (aka the amount of the virus in your system)

In the first 6-12 weeks of infection, the viral load spikes and is extremely contagious. This is known as acute infection and is when HIV is most dangerous.

After this, the virus settles down and the viral load drops back down - it then slowly increases over a period of time. This stage is latent infection. People can remain in the latent stage of infection for years.

Then, once the virus has taken over the body again and knocked your CD4 count down to below 200, that is considered AIDS. In this stage, HIV is not as contagious as it was in the acute infection stage, but is still contagious.

Now, if the person is on medication and has a viral load that is undetectable, they cannot pass HIV to a partner. The risk is zero.

That being said, HIV is an extremely difficult virus to catch..  To put the risk of transmission into perspective, **IF** you came into contact with someone who was positive, *and* they had a high viral load, the risk of contracting it varies by the type of act. 

When not using condoms - The riskiest scenario for infection, is receptive anal sex. 
- The relative risk for this is 1.9% 
- During the acute stage the risk increases sevenfold and goes to 13%. 
- **The risks for all other sexual acts fall dramatically below this.** For more stats you can check out the [relative risk table from Aidsmap.](https://www.aidsmap.com/about-hiv/estimated-hiv-risk-exposure)

It would probably help for the future to re-educate yourself and others on [HIV transmission](https://www.catie.ca/hiv-transmission) and the [likelihood of infection occurring](https://www.aidsmap.com/about-hiv/estimated-hiv-risk-exposure). Also, understanding [U=U](https://www.catie.ca/positive-side/uu) is an important step in destigmatizing HIV and preventing new infections.",2022-02-01 22:31:28,2

The bloke who fucked him before you who claims he is undetectable, if he is having bb sex he will not stay undetectable, and he could very well easily be detectable or transmissive.

sduv0c,Once it’s removed what are you worried about ? Not trying to be rude but genuinely curious?,2022-01-27 15:08:37,1
sduv0c,"If it’s indeed a genital wart, they are caused by HPV. Removal of the wart, independently of the method, only eliminates the lesion, but does not clear the viral infection.

HPV is pretty common, estimates say that everyone in their life will get infected with HPV at some point. Young people are often the group with most exposure because of sexual activity. Talking with your doctor/derm is very helpful. 

If you haven’t gotten the Gardasil vaccine, you may want to get it. It will protect you from other strains of HPV, some of which are considered high risk (HPV-16,18 which can evolve into some types of cancer if untreated. These don’t tend to cause warts.)

In general, most people clear the infection. How long it takes can vary. There is no blood test that can help determine if the infection has been cleared by your body. My overall tip: get vaccinated, keep a healthy lifestyle (good diet, exercise, no drugs/smoking). With time, things should be good and everything will turn out okay.

If you engage in sexual activity, disclosing your status is important. Use protection at all times (vaginal, oral, anal), to keep your girlfriend safe. She most likely is vaccinated against HPV, but you should ask anyway.

I hope everything turns out okay, OP. It’s easier said than done, but keeping an optimistic view is important. I wish you all the best.",2022-01-27 21:41:58,1
sduv0c,Well hpv isn’t permanent. So just tell her you want to wait until marriage or something until you’re sure it’s kinda gone.  Hpv can cause cancer so make sure u get all ur tests,2022-02-03 03:03:14,1

Now for the past two days i have tried cutting down my smoke habits. I havent smoked a whole cigarette in the past two days and i only smoke a bit pot just before sleeping/ after waking up. The thing is i cannot stop at all suddenly. It’s been a habit of mine. I cannot tell my girlfriend or my parents right now. I may tell my girlfriend later in the future when we have sex. But man, im devastated",2022-01-27 22:34:53,1
sduv0c,"No I don’t , I have herpes and PPP which are stuck with me for life but I have GF ? And have sex ? So once your wart is removed you’ll be good won’t you ? I get right now you probably don’t like having it there but it can luckily be removed",2022-01-27 17:18:29,1
sduv0c,"I understand. Facing situations like this is very hard. But there’s many ways to navigate them!

Smoking is linked to a decreased immune response, which can cause a symptomatic presentation (like your wart). HPV infections can be asymptomatic in most occasions, but smoking (tabaco particularly, I have no data on how cannabis affects the immune system and HPV) usually doesn’t help if you want to clear the infection, the same applies to bad diet habits or lack of exercise. A healthy lifestyle is encouraged because it helps to strengthen your immune system, which helps your body to fight the virus.

Quitting is hard (been there myself), but it’s very helpful. Doing it cold turkey is not for everyone, but other ways (like patches, gums) can open the way to at least quit cigarettes while still using nicotine. This is something that, of course, you have to speak with a doctor or a counselor and you have to determine if you are ready to quit so they may guide you towards the best steps to follow so you can achieve it. But it’s a very personal journey.

As for discretion, that’s more than alright. You should only disclose the situation if you feel safe and ready to do so. As for your girlfriend, it would be important if sex comes up, as she could be at risk of contracting it. But that’s something that you’ll work through in due time.

Know that you are not alone, and that you’ll be okay. For now, go to your appointment. Get checked (and indeed confirm that it’s a wart), get treated and talk with your doctor about the Gardasil vaccine. They might also recommend other treatments/lifestyle changes that can help you get back on track.",2022-01-27 22:57:12,2

sdcptj,"You had a low risk exposure for starters. Believe it or not, most sex workers do not have HIV. Symptoms would not start this soon, symptoms usually don’t start until 2-4 weeks after exposure and symptoms do not mean anything as most with symptoms test negative. Antibody tests are basically not going to tell you anything until the 6 week mark post exposure. You can get an RNA test which can give you a sooner conclusive result. 

Vaginal sex is a low risk exposure without a condom with someone positive you are around a 1 in 2000 risk, I assume you stopped as soon as the condom broke which makes your exposure mush less. 

I can understand your fear, but the odds are very much in your favor. I wouldn’t worry to much.",2022-01-26 23:28:27,2

sdcptj,I was in same situation as you( see post history). It will get better as time goes on trust me. Rna test at 14 days is very accurate from what I researched so maybe consider delaying till day 14. If you could wait few more days it would give you a lot of mental peace knowing that you are very likely negative. Then once you get that negative go for 4th gen test at anytime 45 days+ and that will conclusively rule out HIV. I am sure you will be fine. Condom breaking still means that she is seeing clients with condom. Its not like she is seeing clients to have unprotected sex.. Its highly unlikely that she has it and so extremely unlikely that you have it. Everything will be fine. Time is a great healer but those initial days are the hardest.,2022-01-26 20:17:34,1

sdcptj,"  
Ambiguity is a bitch and when we are talking about something that is marketed like HIV it can be devastating. 

It is very unlikely to get infected with only one encounter. Even with a prostitute in Amsterdam. Just get a full STD screening and it would solve a lot of problems.

And the worst-case scenario, if it was positive, don't worry. Just read about what happens when you get HIV in a progressed country like yours. You even can have children and unprotected sex without infecting others. This will be just a pill that you need to take daily. Anything might happen but HIV in a 1st world country is nothing more than a pill you should take regularly.",2022-01-27 07:43:42,1
sdcptj,"Hi there,
I recently had unprotected sex with a sex worker and after 4 days I started having symptoms like tiredness, sore throats, headache, and a low grade fever.

If you are positive, believe me, that nothing is gonna end or change that much. You only have to take a pill every night. That's all. 

If she chose to be with you, then she has to get along with you and your decisions, correct or wrong.  And if she said fuck you and moved on from you, again it is not the end of the world. It is sad, I know. You have to grieve, I know. But there are other girls who would date you and love you.

&#x200B;

I am pretty sure there must be a doctor for these cases even on the weekend and public holidays. Go and consult with them.

Also, you can pay the prostitute to get tested right away. If she is not positive, then you're not as well.

sdcptj,"Till now how many days from exposure?
Certainly NOT, the symptoms will only appear as a reaction to high viral load and so:
1- If the symptoms cleared, then there must be a measurable antibodies that reduced the viral load.
2- symptoms still there due to a high viral load.

In both cases you are clear, especially the symptoms came was so early and this is normally not applicable to HIV infection graphs!

sdcptj,That is going to be different but there are dating sites for people who are hiv positive and there are plenty of women who are educated in the subject and doesn’t bother them as long as you’re undetectable.

sdcptj,"Certainly yes, the HIV standard RNA device like GeneXpert will detect as low as 50 copies per ml, the altar sensitive device will detect even lower like 20 copies per ml.

If your symptoms is due to HIV infection, this means your viral load is so high and guaranteed will be detected by the PCR test.

Even the infected people who is not experiencing any symptoms will be detected by PCR only, and the aim for them is to make it undetectable.

Be sure, your are cleared from HIV, congratulations!",2022-01-31 15:55:26,1

This means there is NO HIV RNA in your blood!

I have done maybe 7 4th gen in between, last one was on Saturday which is my 80th day from exposure, and still having symptoms!

You tell me, what you will do in this case? 

Will you keep throwing it on HIV?

This is not right, the studies said that the PCR will detect it for sure, and then someone affected will be seroconverted just based on this immune response, and the maximum will be 90 days.

So, if there is no HIV RNA, and you have symptoms, then what you will be seroconverted to?

There is no HIV virus that your body is dealing with, which means you are waiting for something does not even exist as long as you do not have another exposure, so you are waiting for nothing.

Your symptoms is due to something else only.

Since it’s NOT detected, this means your symptoms isn’t related to HIV at all.

I also had the same idea as yours, the virus will keep replicating until the body immune system generates antibodies against it.

So, since no RNA then nothing will appear.

I saw that 10 days is actually not that accurate that's why my concern.

sdcptj,"See, scientifically your theory isn’t correct at all.

The virus nature is to replicate and at this stage it must be the highest point with millions of copies per ml.

The symptoms are coming only because of hight viral only.

The infected individuals who does NOT experience symptoms are detectable if they are not on therapy.

So, how about someone who experiencing symptoms, it must be detectable for sure.

The doctors use the PCR to rule out that the symptoms isn’t cases by the HIV.

since you have symptoms, then viral load MUST be detectable.

You are just clear from HIV, believe me.",2022-02-01 15:48:58,1
sdcptj,"I totally understand that!

I am saying that if the symptoms are NOT related but I still have it. 

This could mean that the virus cannot be detected at 10 days since the viral load is below the measuring capability of the machine.

That's why I am worried. I understand that if it was the cause of the symptoms then it would show. However, I am very worried that I have not had the symptoms of the virus yet and therefore it cannot be detected.

The test came back not detected. For an HIV RNA PCR test. The GeneXpert one.

I want to thank you for your comments. Do you suggest I get another PCR at 21 days? To rule it out and peace of mind, because it is still lingering in the back of my head. They say to test at 6 weeks to be sure but it is so difficult for me to wait that long.",2022-02-03 08:58:34,1
sdcptj,"Congratulations once again, you are HIV negative!

No chance of being positive at all.

As per the guidelines, you need to wait for 6 weeks and test with 4 gen just to rule out any odds like HIV-2.

If you can’t wait this long, to reduce the anxiety do a fourth gen test in 28 days from exposure.

This is a very rare type of HIV and mostly available in west Africa, since your exposure isn’t related to Africa the chance is very very low to get it.

Please act normal and you will be just fine.",2022-02-03 09:58:19,1
sdcptj,"Just out of curiosity because it seems like you have done alot of research.

I noticed that when they do the PCR they only take a small amount of blood... is this normal???",2022-02-03 10:00:25,1
sdcptj,"Yes, the PCR now is an automated process, the device will not work if the blood they supply isn’t enough for the testing cartridge.

The PCR test is make based on the blood plasma which is so accurate in detecting any fractions of viral RNA.

the PCR can even detect the RNA in a dried blood - if present - see how sensitive is this test.

It is not an approved test to diagnose the HIV for many reasons and one of them is that this test may give a false positive rather than false negative.

When you get negative from GeneXpert, this means you are clear and no sings of HIV genital material in your blood.

Chill, you are NOT infected, and your symptoms is not related to HIV.

I have also done more than what you have done and there are a millions of people do, the published data about HIV was studied very well and if there is a chance it will be for sure documented.

UK and US guidelines was very very clear, it states a fourth gen test done after 6 weeks does not need to be confirmed.

And the PCR will for sure deny the symptoms caused by HIV.

In contrast, another test 4th gen in 45 days from the exposure day will give the final, and it’s very likely you are negative.",2022-02-03 10:14:11,1

sdcptj,"The reason I ask is because if the viral load is higher by then it will be more accurate no?

The testing center says I should not do any another test until 6 weeks... I just have no idea how to wait that long to make sure I don't have it.

That's why I was thinking getting the RNA one more time at 21 days so if I had it then the viral load would be high.

Is there any possibility that I am still too early for testing with the RNA PCR test? The back of my head is telling me that it is too early and my body still not get sick yet from it...

I really really appreciate your answers",2022-02-03 13:51:31,1
sdcptj,"I don’t know what to answer you really.

You said you had symptoms, so your body is sick!

I’d your body is sick and recognized the virus, the PCR also can detect it!

Now, you either believe that your are sick because of something else like paranoia, or some other infection.

Or you had in worst case scenario - which is so unlikely - an HIV-2.

HIV-2 will only appear in 4th generation sometime around 28 days.

So, making another PCR by 21 days will not change the game and you are just making tests for wasting money.

In my personal opinion, you are HIV free, just wait for 28 days and make one combo.",2022-02-03 14:10:47,1

sdcptj,"This theory is not correct at all!

The virus when in enters the body, the purpose for it is to get replicated and infecting the blood cells.

The aim and the great thing about the PCR is looking for the general material (RNA) in the blood regardless you are sick or not.

The RNA can normally be found in the blood plasma before the seroconversion (regardless with or without symptoms).

The seroconversion period is only counted based on positive RNA and negative antibodies.

Since the RNA isn’t detected now, then you either have not to worry about your symptoms as HIV is not the reason, or you make another serology test (4th gen) test in about 6 weeks to close this chapter.",2022-02-03 14:34:11,1

>However , does our immune system get affected when we first get HIV and the viral load is too high ?

ofc acute hiv affects the immune system, but the negative effects aren't permanent.  cd4 takes a big dip during acute hiv, but it rebounds even without medicine once the immune response kicks in.  unless people start medicine **very** late in infection, there's usually no permanent damage to immune function.

>I feel that sometimes ,we , people with HIV are really pampered by the healthcare system ( which I find great) but it also makes me wonder about the reason why we get all that extra care when we have undetectable viral loads and good CD4 (cancer check ups , etc)

money and politics.  there's funding for hiv that doesn't exist for any other disease.  there's no equivalent to ryan white funding for any other illness.  the funding structure, lobbying/advocacy orgs, and treatment institutions for hiv all came into being decades ago, when hiv was a **very** different disease.  when the first effective regimens came out in the 90s, it took a lot doctors time to manage the brutal side effects.  and so there was a lot of funding to make it possible.  esp bcuz before obamacare people with hiv were nearly 'uninsurable' on the private market.  but as treatment got easier and easier, and as insurance became easier to get, the funding didn't go down.  it actually went **up.**  bcuz there's now a humungous 'hiv industrial complex' with a lot of power to make sure that funding keeps flowing.  it has nothing to do with the current **merits** of giving pwhiv special privileges that people with other diseases don't have.  it's all about our political power and the power of our lobbying groups.  that's the plus side to hiv stigma.  if hiv were 'just like any other treatable disease', that shit wouldn't exist.

>Why do we have loads of comorbidities ?

most people with hiv don't have 'loads of comorbities'.  we get **some** comorbidities at higher rates than the general population.  the biggest reason is bcuz people with hiv **aren't like the rest of the population.**  on average, we are poorer, blacker, more lgbtq, more likely to drink, smoke, use drugs, engage in more risky behaviors, more likely to be homeless or food insecure, more likely to have lifestyles associated with other diseases, more likely to have psychological problems.

it's almost impossible to find a good comparison group that controls for all the factors that put pwhiv at higher risk of many diseases.

the second reason is that 'people with hiv' includes **a large number of people who had unmanaged hiv for years and years before beginning treatment.**  unmanaged hiv causes chronic inflammation and chronic inflammation is a big risk factor for many diseases.  also, 'people with hiv' includes those of us who've had hiv for 30 or 40 years and were on older generations of medicines that are no longer used.  many of those medicines caused permanent damage to some of us.  so 'people with hiv' are a varied group.

hiv medications increase the risk of some diseases, but with modern medicines, it's not that big of a factor.

immunodeficiency is a factor if u consider **everyone** with hiv.  bcuz there's a percentage of people with hiv who did not get on effective medication until hiv had totally decimated their immune system.  to the point that it couldn't always be fully repaired.  but if u only at people who **started medicine early**, immunodeficiency wouldn't be a factor.

the stats on comorbidities are **averages.**  someone who starts biktarvy during acute infection in 2021 isn't gonna be at the same risk of medication- and immunodeficiency- related comorbidities as someone who was infected in 1984, spent years on toxic medicines like ddi and ddc and d4t, didn't become undetectable until the virus was active for 15 years.

>is it that our immune system is not as good as it used to be before getting HIV ?

depends when the person starts medicine and how damaged their immune system is at that point.  also depends on their age at infection.  people infected at birth who aren't immediately medicated can have perma damage that people infected as grownups don't have.  someone who doesn't start medicine until their cd4 is close to zero might have permanent damage that won't be fully reversed.  but someone who starts medicine early after infection won't have any permanent damage to their immune system.

not if medicine is started early.

>Also , I remember having to get some boosters for hep b immunity ( I don't know if the immunity got lost due to the early hiv infection or it was just a normal thing that happens to everyone regardless of their status)

everyone needs multiple shots of the hep b vax.  it's 2, 3, or 4 shots depending on diff things like age and type of vaccine.  without knowing your full immunization history, nobody can tell you anything.  hep b titers [go down in everybody](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23408522/) after primary vaccination.   we have no deets at all about your immunization history, your titers of hb surface ab, or anything else.  or your hiv history.  but there's no reason to think it's related.",2022-01-18 01:23:11,3

To put the risk of transmission into perspective, IF you came into contact with someone who was positive, *and* they had a high viral load, the risk of contracting it varies by the type of act.

rsdoca,That is very relieving. However 4th gen tests are only 100% accurate 6 weeks out. I don’t think u have hiv since it’s oral sex with a female and you both got symptoms this fast. It’s most likely a cold. Bc you wouldn’t have gotten it at the same time it would have been weeks apart.,2022-01-05 17:29:53,1

rpjlna,"Hi, I’m so sorry about this :( 
I have no position to really comment but I noticed no one else was. 
I have hpv and I’m a woman, so I risk cancer and had to get a biopsy and I’m waiting on results.
I don’t want you to think I’m comparing by all means because I can imagine this is worse for you.
I got curious about peoples stories of hiv because a friend of mine sister who is also my friend (a woman) got hiv from a partner who definitely knew he had it. 
I remember her telling me she wasn’t the same for months. Crying in the shower and just feeling gross all the time. 
Now I can not necessarily empathize with you other than I know how that feels to an extent and feeling like you’ve lost control of your own body and that someone did this to you. 
But it’s not your fault. 
You’re not gross and you’re not any different than you were before. 
There are lots of books, forums, and I’m sure groups for this because it does kinda shrink your dating pool a little bit which is okay! Just be honest with people from the start. 
You are strong enough to do this. My friend has been positive for about two years now and she was very suicidal in the beginning but now she is going to cosmetology school dating a nice guy and doing really well. 
Get a therapist, work on yourself, be honest and always wear protection from now on! 
I’m here for you and I’m rooting for you. Please don’t hesitate to message me or anything. 
Love ya friend!",2021-12-28 01:08:26,2

rpe4av,"Hey man, I work as a doctor, and, although I don’t want to give out any advice on here, I hope I can help reassure you somewhat.  

There are so many different things that can cause a sore throat, and it is likely, although not guaranteed, that if you’ve had contact with your brother, and he has a similar illness, that you probably both have a virus or something. Strep isn’t the only thing that can cause a sore throat, but it’s a relatively common culprit, which is why it’s tested. For example, I had Covid a couple of weeks ago and had a sore throat. As far as visiting the sexual health clinic, that’s probably a good idea.  It’s very unlikely that you have caught HIV, but you are doing the right thing in being tested.  Chlamydia is very common, and very treatable. It’s also totally fine to be anxious about this - these things happen.  I’m hoping you feel better now, and I hope I’ve helped alleviate some of the anxiety.",2021-12-29 21:07:37,1

2. no matter when u start treatment, early or late, medicine will almost always get u to an undetectable viral load.  that has nothing to do with whether u will still test positive for hiv.  u test positive for hiv if u have certain antibodies to hiv, not if yr viral load is detectable.  
3. if u start treatment, hiv will be suppressed and can't cause immunodeficiency.

rnaod4,"Contracting HIV via oral sex is extremely low. In order for HIV to be transmitted successfully there needs to be a few things that happen.

1.) A person with HIV. 
2.) A person who doesn’t have HIV. 
3.) A way for HIV to escapa the body. In this case, through bodily fluids and HIV only lives in certain bodily fluids. 
4.) An act that requires said bodily fluids to enter the body through a mucus membrane. 
5.) Doing the act with no barrier and/or treatment as prevention.

relks7,That’s strange but I wouldn’t say it’s a positive. Did they prescribe you diflucazole medicine?,2021-12-30 02:32:42,1
relks7,They gave me flucanizole (that one pill that you’re supposed to take for years infection 2x and it didn’t work). When I went to urgent care before I went to a gyno they prescribed me metronidazole pills which is used for BV and trich but the pain didn’t stop. Then when I went to the gyno she gave me the flucanizole pills and  the cream version which make the pain worse. When I went for a final check up at the 3 month mark she did the Pap smear said there was a little bit of discharge but she didn’t say if I still had a yeast infection or not. But like I said I got tested for everything under the sun and everything came back negative. The only thing I didn’t test for at the 3rd month mark was for hsv2 which I hard takes at least 12 weeks to show up in igg blood test. I was doing some research and came across something called vulvodynia which perfectly describes what I’m experiencing and I mentioned it to my gyno but she brushed me off. I don’t have health insurance and have already racked up a shit load of money just on lab tests. I feel like I’m losing my mind.,2021-12-30 02:40:39,1
relks7,I understand that. Do you live near a free clinic ?we have them in VA but the yeast infections are usually from ART kill both bad and good bacteria  that why most HIV positive get them more frequent then most. Not really because of HIV I just talked to my fiancé about it. He had fever flu and like rocking on the boat kinda it’s like being terribly drunk dizziness.,2021-12-30 02:52:03,1
relks7,Oo gotcha. I was under the impression that it’s a symptom of infection. The only “free” clinic near me is planned parenthood but if you want to see the nurse they charge you based on income which is still a good amount of money.,2021-12-30 02:58:47,1
relks7,But rest easy that is not a symptom it’s due to the volatility of the medication in the ART. So you got something else going on. internet is a double edge sword for information really.,2021-12-30 03:02:54,1
relks7,Yea I really need to stop googling symptoms but my anxiety gets the best of me sometimes. But thanks for the advice :),2021-12-30 03:09:12,1
relks7,When I  go to the ID with my man next I’ll see if the docs got any suggestions for you,2021-12-30 03:11:41,1

r2poes,"I just had this happen to me a couple weeks ago. From what I read, it depends on the situation.
Did you receive penetration?
If so, did they finish inside of you?
Did you penetrate?
Receptive people are more likely to contract HIV than the one that penetrates.
It take 2 weeks to 3 months for HIV to develop, but you want to test every 3 months to be fully sure.
Most people don't develop symptoms, which means testing is the only way to be sure.
If you took the rapid test, that will show pretty well, but if you do the P24, then that will be more accurate, but according to many clinicians, nurses, and doctors I have spoken with over the past 3 weeks since my encounter, waiting the 3 months is going to be the best bet.

I also found that Acute stages increase transmission rate, so do the STIs, and I have like a cut... that's what makes me extremely worried. Deep down I know that I most likely don't have it, but man do these thoughts tear my mind every minute of every day, what if I am wrong... Im basically 2 weeks on from exposure, and I'm monitoring symptoms that can arise during seroconversion stage, mainly fever, but the fact that my lower back hurts a bit makes me worried since myalgia is also a common symptom, although I have not found answers whether it can manifest on its own.",2021-11-19 19:07:00,0

To be honest, I'm a very laid-back person, I love my life, I have everything that I need in terms of family, friends, money, and now I feel like because of basically 20-30 mins of my life I have put all on the scale. I see what you are saying, and most likely you are correct, but as I have said, this is the first time I have ever felt like this. Never had any STIs or anything... so it's my first exposure to something like this. Imagine, 28 years of age, a grown adult, and I'm scared shitless...  I try to stop, mind my own business, then I notice this weird feeling in my back, and it all starts over again... Searching for information about seroconversion, running for my thermometer, although I am certain I do not have a fever.

Not everyone uses medications or is aware of their status. In addition, if you are injecting heavy drugs on common occasions, I would imagine looking out for a sore throat or fever might be the least of your concerns to detect it early on.",2021-11-19 20:39:19,1
qxm7s0,"Transmission rates are impossible to measure accurately. We can't purposely inject 10,000 people with HIV-contaminated needles and count how many end up contracting HIV. While that would give you an accurate estimate (the more people we inject the better!), it wouldn't exactly be ethical. So I guess the CDC's methodology to estimate the transmission rate is the best we can do. Also, the assumption inherent in this estimate is that you get injected by a needle that was previously injected into someone who is already known to be HIV+. The chances of getting HIV after being injected with a needle previously injected into someone with unknown HIV status would be lower.",2021-11-19 20:53:30,1

yr timeline doesn't tell us how long after yr last hi risk activity yr last neg test was.  if yr dec 2020 test was 3-6 mos after yr last unprotected hi risk sex, then it's prob a false pos.  it's not impossible to get hiv from giving oral, but it's real unlikely.  but we can't tell from yr deets if u could've been in the window period during yr last neg test.

the worst case scenario isn't that bad.  with one pill a day, almost everyone w a new infxn can be undetectable in short time, never experience immunodeficiency, and be incapable of infecting their sex partners.  it's about as easy to manage as any chronic disease that exists.

qtrajz,"Well I believe HIV doesn’t transmit through saliva, but I’m not too sure because HIV can transmit through sperm. There is always precum too if they didn’t ejaculate in your mouth. I don’t know when this possible exposure happened, but HIV symptoms take 2-4 weeks to show up. But as always if you’re worried go get tested. One now, so it can give you a peace of mind.

I truly had no idea. The only thing I will say is that I was sooooo fatigued. I was diagnosed with a CD4 of 201 - an AIDS diagnosis is 200 and lower. So, I was very sick and I literally just thought I was depressed because I wanted to sleep all the time. Turns out my body was literally shutting down… but that was the only major indicator I really had - and I misread it.

qsdg5l,"TEARS foundation is based in SA and helps anyone in need (the charity is for ppl who have been sexually assaulted) regardless of ethnicity, race, culture etc. The free helpline number *134*7355# - Available 24/7. 

You must please phone NOW. Explain how you have been feeling - and tell them everything you’ve been feeling - include feelings of suicide and extremely intrusive and obsessive thoughts about hiv. They can arrange counselling for you. You will not be judged so please make sure they understand the seriousness of your current state.

Another organisation is Rape Crisis SA - another 24/7 helpline available on 0214479762
Also - on their website https://rapecrisis.org.za/ you can actually WhatsApp them - so that may be even easier for you. 

Remember that you deserve help for what you’ve been through. What you are feeling now (this obsession with hiv) is directly caused by the trauma you’ve faced. 

If you get therapy and proper help from these charities you can start to work on getting better mentally. You have to start the process, so please promise me you will contact them. You can start with saying this:

“I was sexually assaulted/raped X years ago and I’m really struggling to cope. I’ve become obsessed with hiv, even though I don’t have it, and I’m having really intrusive and never-ending  obsessive thoughts about hiv. It’s got so bad that I keep convincing myself I have it, and I’ve even felt suicidal lately due to the extremity of these thoughts.

These thoughts are not based on logic and I am not at any real risk. I am getting help from a charity. With the help of others I WILL get better and I won’t have these extreme thoughts anymore.” :)

He didn’t look sick at all but I talk to him regularly and he has mentioned he hasn’t feeling well this year. Colds, weakness and got his gallbladder removed last year. I thought ok this has been an stressful year for everyone and it’s ok to feel under the weather.  But now I don’t know if he is lying to me about his health and he is actually feeling a lot worse. I feel like there is not other way to be certain that getting tested but I just can’t get my head around this situation. I thought I knew this guy, it’s an old friend of mine. We used to have sex, sometimes unprotected and never had an issue with it. He thinks i am crazy for believing he may have had HIV but I haven’t made up all these symptoms. He is from Mexico btw.

Just looking to see if anybody has experienced such symptoms or if I can trust the two oraquick (oral swab) negative results I got.  Also, I had covid last winter plus got vaccinated recently so I don’t know if these are also contributing to what I am experiencing. My doctor is now telling me that I am paranoid, smh!",2021-11-13 22:52:50,1
qqgmkb,"Ok, so the important thing to note here is that hiv can’t be diagnosed purely on the basis of symptoms. The reason for that is that symptoms that are attributed to hiv (whether the acute or latent stage) are very general symptoms and could apply to a whole range of different illnesses - including non-serious common viruses that are passed around. So many people get colds - I can think of a few of my friends who have been ill all year round with similar things and def don’t have hiv/aids! The gallbladder thing may be connected to AIDS but if he had reached the AIDS stage you’d probably know about it - he’d be and look incredibly sick and probably hospitalised. Not just a few colds here and there.

The other important thing to note is that he tested negative. Why not ask him to send his evidence to you? If he’s a straight male then it’s rather unlikely he has it in the first place - unless he is bi or has a preference for trans women or injects drugs. The prevalence rate in Mexico is also low (0.3%) and the majority of the Mexicans with hiv are men who have sex with men. 

I am very doubtful you have hiv, but the only way to know for sure is to do a blood test.",2021-11-10 09:52:25,1
qqgmkb,The thing is that I was in my best shape and health before all this happened. He sent me his negative results but not sure if I can trust this if he is in a latent stage as I assumed. Will a negative result  from a blood test be conclusive from a person who has AIDS? He considers himself a straight guy but I remember he used to ask me to do anal sex and I never agreed. I guess the only way to find out is getting a blood test at this point which I am just not ready just yet. I am still trying to process all this and the fact that is happening with a guy i trusted. So stupid I know…,2021-11-10 11:33:16,1
qqgmkb,"Yes a blood test would definitely be conclusive if they have AIDS - a blood test looks for hiv antibodies and these would exist  whether he has hiv or AIDS. The only way the test would be negative but he is actually positive would be if he was tested in the window period (eg the time just following infection when antibodies may not yet show up in the blood). 99% of ppl with hiv will have antibodies within 3 months, though.

You should do a hiv test or else you’re gonna stress and make yourself sick just from worrying so much. I’m very sure you’ll be negative and at least once you’ve done the test, you’ll be 100% sure of that.",2021-11-10 11:46:27,1

qq0mey,You do not have hiv!,2021-11-12 09:51:58,1
qq0mey,If you really had symptoms because of the hiv you would get tested positive by 4th gen test at that time. You get symptoms because the viral loads are very high during the acute phase which means there is enough amount of p24 proteins for the 4th gen test to pick it up and the body will also starts making antibodies to the virus. The 4th gen test will pick up either antigens or antibodies. So I can say that those symptoms were not related to the HIV if you test is negative. Get tested at 12 weeks with any test for the peace of your mind. Many experts and many countries guidelines say 4th gen test are conclusive at 6weeks post exposure. I am in same situation my friend. My 8 weeks test is negative and will retest at 12 weeks.,2021-11-14 12:07:48,1

That's a huge load to carry on your own. We're a pretty expressive family and big on the being there for him. We all went to a stay show with him for his coming out party things like that.

I am not trying to downplay the severity of untreated HIV, but with treatment, life doesn’t change. One just takes a pill every day. In fact, there is an injection that has recently been approved that is monthly. Just one shot a month and no pills. I have a coupon friends that are on it. They love it.

Thank you for the kind words! I’ll keep this updated",2021-11-29 08:35:51,1
qnh4lt,"Ahhh I feel so much for you. It’s a really scary time and I imagine anyone would be incredibly fearful if they got such a call, even though you have all the info/facts/figures and know that these days hiv is nothing more than a manageable health condition for which you’d probably only need 1 pill a day. The stigma is of course the real factor here - but times are changing. People are much more clued up on U=U, PrEP, PEP, that hiv isn’t a life sentence (far from it, in a lot of developed countries poz ppl have higher life expectancies than neg)! And there will be a cure within the next 5 years - I’m quite sure of it!

In terms of dating etc - if you get bad news (and maybe in the meantime to ease your worries) you should watch Jennifer Vaughan videos on YouTube. She’s this amazing woman who has totally embraced her status, she’s completely at peace with it and she wants her face to be out there telling ppl it’s ok! That she lives a completely normal life! She was married (split now not due to her status) and is now dating again. She holds down her old job. She has told everyone and made herself public! Such a cool lady.

But 2bh most of this is irrelevant. I do doubt you’ll be poz based on the result of your rapid. Rapids are extremely reliable and highly accurate. I think you’re negative. Obviously you’re doing the right thing by getting blood tests, but I have high hopes for you.

Either way, you will be ok! You will - I promise!",2021-11-06 11:22:02,2
qnh4lt,"So sorry you're going through this! this is a safe place and we are here for you. If you've passed at least 6 weeks from your last exposure, the chance of getting a false negative rapid test is very very low. I think you're fine also you're not alone, many have had close calls. I had a false positive result and literally almost passed out from the shock so EVEN if your first 4th gen comes reactive until it's confirmed it still could be false positive. So just relax don't worry about something until you have a tangible reason to worry. If you god forbid got a confirmed hiv diagnosis Then you can try to figure out life after the diagnosis so don't worry about it now.",2021-11-05 18:37:00,1

Idk, I’m trying to just continue until I get the results from the blood work. It was/is still so scary though. I will look up Jennifer!! I think I’m nervous too bc I’m mostly straight and there’s not as much acceptance or knowledge in the straight community as the gay community.

qmpm2e,"In regards to HIV - if you came into contact with someone who was positive, the risk of contracting it varies by the type of act. So I will go with the riskiest scenario here, which is receptive anal sex. The relative risk for this is 1.9% - and if the person was newly infected (first 6-12 weeks), which is when they are most infectious, the risk goes to 13%. 

[The risks for all other sexual acts fall dramatically below this.](https://www.aidsmap.com/about-hiv/estimated-hiv-risk-exposure) For an insertive male into a vagina the risk is 0.04% - not during a period.

I don’t know the stats for period sex. There are a lot of factors that would increase the risk - the biggest being, if she was positive, did she have a high viral load - low viral loads are unable to infect. Also, was there a way for the virus to enter your bloodstream…? 

**A little education for you while we are on the topic**, if the Person with HIV is on medication and has an undetectable viral load, even when condoms are not used used this risk goes down to [zero](https://www.catie.ca/en/positiveside/summer-2017/uu) (known as U=U or treatment as prevention and is backed by the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/art/index.html), the [NIH](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/science-clear-hiv-undetectable-equals-untransmittable), [UNAIDS](https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/featurestories/2018/july/undetectable-untransmittable) and many other organizations based on data from the [PARTNER](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)30418-0/fulltext) & [PARTNER2](https://www.aidsmap.com/news/jul-2018/zero-transmissions-mean-zero-risk-partner-2-study-results-announced) studies.)

I’m probably just overthinking & causing stress/anxiety related symptoms to show up. Thank you for all that information, it’s helped me calm down a bit😅 I’ll still get tested when it hits 6 weeks just in case",2021-11-04 19:40:09,1
qmpm2e,"I mean - regular checkups usually don’t included hiv outside the lgbtq community. So even if she is being tested, hiv may not be included. 

I was positive for 2 years without knowing and I thought I was being tested for everything every 3 months when I got my birth control. But I learned later that hiv wasn’t included - so be careful with that. It usually needs to be specifically requested. 

You can really never know someone’s status, and many people are uneducated, so it’s important to be vigilant with your own testing as well. 

That being said - the stats are on your side. As an insertive male you’re the second lowest risk category after lesbians. During those two years I was positive I had sex with my partner multiple times and he never contracted hiv.",2021-11-04 20:02:13,1

qminbq,"Listen up guys .

6 months is meant for people who are immunosuppressed, or under going a chemotherapy or having hepatitis C and severely ill from it. But normal people start developing this antibodies at most ""4 weeks"" from infection. Infact 95% on an average produce antibodies at the 4th week.. And by the 12th week Mark over 99.9 have enough Antibodies to test positive.  Therefore, if you test for hiv with a 3rd generation Antibody rapid test (blood finger prick type to be specific) and it came out Negative then you are NEGATIVE. This is the current guideline by even the most conversative hiv organisation. Infact even if you were on PEP, the guidelines suggests 12 weeks from exposure day to get tested and close it up that you are negative.
Do not allow people with extreme phobia and guidelines ignorance to emotionally traumatise you with their unfounded Opinions. 
If you test at 6 weeks mark and it's Negative then you are most likely to be negative,  and the 12th week mark test will confirm this for you. 
Good luck mates.",2022-02-05 14:28:02,2

It used to be 6 mths not because people took 6 mths to produce antibodies but because the testing technology wasn’t great and it took longer for the tests to react to already present antibodies. But this was in the late 90’s.

qjwoxa,"Keep calm brother, I hope you learned your lesson, always use condoms to prevent disease. So,
the girl do you know her or was it just a ONS? If you know ask her for her STDs oder HIV. HIV needs 3-4 until it shows some symptoms and not all symptoms show together. Maybe you got some cold or flu. But it could also be another STD. So You need to get tested. But if u got HIV it is not a death sentences anymore! If you take ur medicine and get checked every 3 month you have same Life expectancy like before and you can’t transmit it to other. So it is very rare to transmit HIV from female to male with condom, but in your case it could be possible if u had any cuts during the act where the Vaginal fluid or bleed could enter. And if ur man is circumcised the chance is also lower to catch it. But many things are also in ur mind that drives ur crazy. So you Need to relax.

qfyfcq,"I took PEP about a year ago after I had unprotected sex with a guy I had been talking to online. It wasn’t my intention to have sex without protection but in the moment I did what I did. Needless to say, I regretted it and subsequently went to urgent care to be screened for stds and get on PEP. I was given a prescription and was on it I’d say maybe 4-5 hours after potential exposure. While I was happy to have acted preemptively, that optimism quickly faded as I began to feel symptoms related to the medication. I felt very nauseous and lethargic. Most days I was exhausted and just wanted to lay in bed. The nauseousness was really difficult to deal with and the constant stomach aches made the experience uncomfortable. Overall though I would do it all over again (taking PEP, not having bareback sex). It was an eye opening experience and though I had considered taking PrEP, this experience made me feel like it wasn’t for me. I would endeavor to be safer and more selective about my sexual exploits. Thankfully, I’ve stuck to that.

If you’re asking because you’re considering taking it, I would say to do it. It may be unpleasant for the next month but it won’t be anything that will severely impact your ability to function day to day. Not to mention the fact that it can significantly reduce the chance of seroconversion. Also, time in this case truly is of the greatest importance. The closer to potential exposure that PEP is taken, the higher the chance that it will help potential conversion if you have in fact been exposed to HIV.",2021-10-26 04:32:38,3

qezjcc,"Well as an HIV positive person I hope so. However I really hope it gets fully preventeable before. To avoid further infections and stop this pandemic.

Currently there are trials ongoing for a mRNA vaccine to prevent it. Which is already a huge step forward to end this. If no one else can get it and if we can erradicate it, there is not a real need for a cure so urgently.

Regarding a Cure, once again you can read about progress on google. But apart from *antiretroviral treatment (ARV)* the cure seems to be a little bit far away yet.

HIV is really good hiding on the human body, that ends up being a plus to achieve the Undetectable and Untransmissable state, however makes it really hard to fully cure. I believe that the number of mutations that the virus suffers through a lifetime also increase difficulty of this scenario.

I havent slept and feel physically sick all the time, all whilst pretending to be my happy smiling self to family, friends and at work. The thought of having to wait another week for the results I feel will literally kill me.

Im so stressed, panicked and anxious that I cant think straight. The nurse did say I was slightly above the cut off point that pushed my results to be a ""low reactive"".

Finger prick tests usually have an accuracy of 95%. For your own good, stop doubting science and go check your **Viral Load.** That is the only way to be 100% sure and the only way to start your treatment.

The thin line might simply mean that you are not that reactive, therefore the infection is brand new. This is just a ""*might*"". Do not grab that hope about *not having it* it will absolutely destroy you once you run out of ""*mights"".*  Trust me... I have been there.

I respect your insight. This is not a playground. She had a *false positive* as **you** call it... It might not be false at all!!!

She needs blood work with a conclusive test and then she can have her peace or deal with it (and achieve her peace after.)

q9i735,"The answers you seek can be easily found in Google. 

Let me break it down really easily. The most risky behavior is receptive anal sex. Many other sexual practices also represent a (very small) risk of infection. That being said, male homosexual partners have an increased risk factor for that very same reason.

Sharing incertive toys or acessories might also increase this risk for the reason stated above. 

For a better projection, the official statistics say that for a male to contract HIV through sex with an infected female partner represent only 0.04% of risk.

[https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/overview/about-hiv-and-aids/how-is-hiv-transmitted](https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/overview/about-hiv-and-aids/how-is-hiv-transmitted) 

Combine that reading above with a research on your own about statistics regarding specific practices. 

Remember that 0.04% is not 0.00%. It is still 1 in 2500 cases.

I hope this breaks it down for you in a very simplistic way and I hope you do some digging on your own since you seem to be interested in this.

If you did have a risky behavior please test yourself after 8 weeks of the possible exposure.",2021-10-16 19:19:03,1
q9i735,"Here’s some info about how it’s spread sexually : 

To put the risk of getting HIV into perspective and spread a little awareness here, receptive anal sex is the riskiest sexual act with a relative risk of 1.9% per encounter when having anal intercourse with someone with *unmanaged* HIV. [The risks for all other sexual acts fall dramatically below this.](https://www.aidsmap.com/about-hiv/estimated-hiv-risk-exposure) Add a properly used condom into the equation, and this % goes down to zero. (Latex and polyurethane condoms are highly effective in preventing HIV)

HIV is actually a very weak virus that actually isn’t as infectious as we have been told - it needs an alignment of specific things in order for infection to occur.

**However**, if the Person with HIV is on medication and has an undetectable viral load, even when condoms are not used used this risk goes down to [zero](https://www.catie.ca/en/positiveside/summer-2017/uu) (known as U=U or treatment as prevention and is backed by the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/art/index.html), the [NIH](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/science-clear-hiv-undetectable-equals-untransmittable), [UNAIDS](https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/featurestories/2018/july/undetectable-untransmittable) and many other organizations based on data from the [PARTNER](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)30418-0/fulltext) & [PARTNER2](https://www.aidsmap.com/news/jul-2018/zero-transmissions-mean-zero-risk-partner-2-study-results-announced) studies.) This also significantly lowers the chance of transferring HIV through childbirth (to zero with proper adherence to meds).

A fun fact, it’s actually riskier to be with someone who doesn’t know their status then it is to be with someone who had been diagnosed and is on medication. The majority of new infections actually come from people who think they are ‘clean’ as they are most infectious in the weeks after infection while the viral load spikes -
the virus also won’t show up on tests during this time - so this is where the most risk comes in. After this, the viral load actually drops down and enters a latency stage that can last for years and the virus becomes far less infectious.

Be patient, think about good things. Everything will be OK **even** if you do have HIV.I would place the odds on the low now... Seriously.

If you were not exposed to a HIV+ individual there is absolutely **no chance** on contracting HIV. It does not appear out of thin air.

q6lbix,"Again I'm so sorry for what you went through BIG HUGS.

first of all, there is NO risk with blood draws like none. Thats everyone's ocd trigger cause it has needles but I can assure you there us mechanisms automatically on blood draw devices that reassures they can not be reused. Also a freak thing like this happened in the 90s (before the safety mechanism) and even with that and 100s being exposed no one picked up a single infection.

now regarding the intrusive thoughts, it's gonna take some hard work and the only way to save yourself from this is to not give a shit. the more bigger compulsions you do the more ridiculous your ocd is gonna become. Life is so short is it worth lowering your quality of life for something that has such a low risk of happening? Your chance of dying in an accident is 1 in 100 does that mean you'll ever leave the house? Just to Mae you feel better there are people that literally share needles, have injuries at works or willingly have unprotected sex with strangers and leave with nothing. Just don't actively put yourself in harms way and you'll be fine and try to ignore the intrusive thoughts. PTSD is a bit more complicated, I highly recommend going to a therapist for that. My trauma was actually getting a false positive for an hiv test (like you can get this close but not have it) and then had to go through series of ptsd therapy sessions that really helped. I also developed a really bad ocd response to hiv but I realized if I continue I'll never be able to leave the house or date or anything etc.",2021-10-12 18:20:09,1

In my opinion, IF he was positive and didn’t disclose, he is likely on treatment and non-transmissible - which puts you at no risk physically.

Unless he’s a sociopath - but an HIV diagnosis really messes with people and they spend a lot of time feeling guilty and scared to pass on the virus. Most people are cautious not to put others in the position they are in - because they know what it’s like… if anything, most people refrain from sex because they are scared or rejection or the stress it would cause them.

Let’s say you did come into contact with the virus.  HIV is actually a very weak virus that actually isn’t as infectious as we have been told - it needs an alignment of specific things in order for infection to occur: a high amount of the virus present in the infected partner, a substantial method of entry into the new hosts body and an inadequate immune response from the new host. 

Receptive anal sex is the **riskiest** sexual act with a relative risk of 1.9% per encounter when having anal intercourse with someone with *unmanaged/untreated* HIV.

q3mqv2,"Lol it is accurate. 

I provided a link to a website that has a table describing the risk for all other acts - I only identified the risk of receptive anal in my comment as it is the worst case scenario and I don’t have the energy to type out all the risk factors. 

But since we are sticklers for info here: 
As an insertive male into a vagina, the risk of contracting HIV when exposed to *active* HIV is 0.04%. This increases to 0.11% for inserting anally. (you can multiply these by 7.25 to get the relative risk during the acute/most infectious stage) And, as mentioned above, the risk is **zero** when there’s an undetectable viral load.

Please identify the inaccurate info in my original post.",2021-10-08 19:08:18,1

HIV is VERY difficult to catch - even in the riskiest situation of receptive anal sex during the MOST infectious stage (first 6-12 weeks after infection), the chance of infection is around 11%. And that’s like, multimillions of copies of the virus being inserted directly into a microtorn anus tissue. 

In order for infection to occur, there would have had to have been a large amount of active HIV virus in the blood that may have been on your lab coat. It would have then had to enter into the mucous membranes of your eye and then your immune system would need to be unable to fight them off.

phase 3 trials serve a purpose. besides demonstrating efficacy, they demonstrate safety in a way prior phases can't bcuz they aren't powered to detect small but very serious or even fatal risks.  
  
i agree that desperate peeps should get early access to unproven medicines if they want it. but it should be done by expanding compassionate use. and forcing pharma to provide compassionate use drugs to people whose fda petitions are approved.  
  
this bill isn't for patients. it's for pharma. it doesn't provide earlier access to unproven medicines at low cost for desperate patients.  
  
what it does is DRASTICALLY lower the standards of safety and efficacy that must be met before pharma can SELL their products. it also allows pharma TO CHARGE US WHATEVER THEY WANT for the unproven drugs. it forces insurance to cover it AT ANY PRICE PHARMA SETS. but not to cover it fully, so we'll still get stuck with big copays. so they get paid for using us as guinea pigs! and then, when people are harmed by any dangerous and ineffective drugs, this bill COMPLETELY SHIELDS PHARMA FROM LIABILITY FOR THE DAMAGES!  
  
pharma wants to have their cake and eat it too. they wanna charge thru the nose for medicines not proven safe or effective. but they don't want patients to get a dime when we're harmed by their dangerous and useless drugs!  
  
there's a reason this bill is supported by the astroturf, pharma funded 'patient advocacy groups' but NOT the grassroots groups actually looking out for our welfare.

are yr parents going to open his mail?  if they're that nosy, you shouldn't have let them move in.  he can have the pharmacy ship somewhere else if he's that worried.

it was kind of unfair for you to have yr parents move in if you knew they were gonna nose around in his business and then subject him to stigma.  imo, you need to block that shit better.  you should've told yr dad 'no' on the life ins before yr bf applied.  and told yr mom to butt tf out or she's not welcome to live with you anymore.

i mean, it's not really fair to subject yr bf to all this anxiety of living with nosy judgemental assholes.

[The risks for all other sexual acts fall dramatically below this.](https://www.aidsmap.com/about-hiv/estimated-hiv-risk-exposure) Add a properly used condom into the equation, and this % goes down to zero. (Latex and polyurethane condoms are highly effective in preventing HIV)

**However**, if the Person with HIV is on medication and has an undetectable viral load, even when condoms are not used used this risk goes down to [zero](https://www.catie.ca/en/positiveside/summer-2017/uu) (known as U=U or treatment as prevention and is backed by the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/art/index.html), the [NIH](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/science-clear-hiv-undetectable-equals-untransmittable), [UNAIDS](https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/featurestories/2018/july/undetectable-untransmittable) and many other organizations based on data from the [PARTNER](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)30418-0/fulltext) & [PARTNER2](https://www.aidsmap.com/news/jul-2018/zero-transmissions-mean-zero-risk-partner-2-study-results-announced) studies.) This also significantly lowers the chance of transferring HIV through childbirth (to zero with proper adherence to meds).",2021-10-05 05:12:42,1

q00j3d,"Yeah I don’t blame u for being anxious. I also don’t blame u for being upset if you feel like he deliberately put ur health at risk. If he did then that’s a crime and he needs to answer for what he did. I would say maybe don’t come at him aggressively, try to be calm and the opposite of upset. That way u can get the truth. Being confrontational will only lead to him lying. As far as the STD, he may not have known he had anything. I had a friend give me an std without knowing he had it. It can happen if he doesn’t get tested regularly (as was the case with my friend). But with potentially being positive, if he is, was tested and received confirmation before u guys ever hooked up, well that’s just straight up f*cked up.",2021-10-03 01:40:06,1

pz82mv,You can if you need the peace of mind. I am sure you are good though if your test came back negative. HIV doesn't take long to show up like the internet will have you believe. You are negative. Good for you 🙂 be more careful next time. I know from experience that having to go get on a regime of pep is just a pain in the ass.,2021-10-01 19:14:27,1

pz82mv,Well the test came back negative so it's got to be something else. First thing tomorrow at 9 AM go to your local health department and get one more rapid HIV test. The whole process should take less than hour. The test itself only takes 20 min. That way when it shows up negative you will know it's not HIV. I seriously doubt after a negative test a second one will all of a sudden be positive. It doesnt work like that. Just go get one more to rule it out. Tell the people there what's going on. They can refer u somewhere that can get to the bottom of what is going on with you. See a physician. I'm sorry you're going through this. I'm sure it will all be resolved.

pz82mv,Regardless it sounds like it is just too early.. I think you should do what I suggested in the morning. It sounds like it is something else. Not only that u tested negative and women so very rarely pass the virus through sex to men. I knew of a couple some years back where the woman was positive and the man wasnt and they were together 10 years. Had sex onna regular bases. No condoms. They just didnt do it while she was on her period. That was a story I heard through a friend of mine and they were his friends and he wasnt the type to lie.

I was drinking non stop for 3 months and was ready to end it all. At the end of 3 months i tested negative and the symptoms just left. Because it was all in my head. I have gone for many tests since then all good. But i still have massive paranoia and when ever i have sex or even get a bj or even handjob i tent to freak out afterwards and start feeling sick.

I myself have only been like that the times I was either too scared to go get tested, or was freaking out about a person I was intimate with... which are really one in the same I suppose.

pwr8z3,"If you tested negative in July and the possible exposure was in may then you are good. I used to see an HIV specialist for a prep prescription when I was a commercial sex worker and I asked him a bunch of questions and he told me that theres never any false negative test results and if anything maybe a false positive. He also told me if you test negative after like 2 weeks after possible exposure 9 out of 10 times the test results are going to stay negative. Take one more rapid HIV test while you wait for the cervix test results to come back to ease your mind cus I'm sure u know an HIV test takes 20 minutes. Like I said, you tested negative 2 months after the sex, i promise you are most likely good. I'd say I promise you're 100 percent good but I'm not a doctor. It's scary I know but the tests are very accurate and HIV doesnt have some super long incubation or whatever as the internet may have u believe. If you're tested 2 weeks after the sex those results are in most cases the correct ones I recommend taking another rapid test so y can rest easy. The stress isnt healthy. It's going to be okay.

You are more likely to have an immaculate conception than contract HIV from the situation you described.

prh602,"I’m very sorry that you’re so scared about this. It sounds like you have a quite serious health anxiety issue about hiv. You should try counselling or therapy (if possible - not sure what country you are in) because otherwise this anxiety will cause you many problems and upset in your life. You should prioritise this over anything else as it’s really affecting you.

There is little point in me going into the details of why you DEFINITELY DON’T have hiv, as your health anxiety won’t allow you to believe me. But I promise you that you do not have hiv. A cut on a nurse’s finger is meaningless, you can’t get hiv that way, even if she’s not wearing gloves. And the syringe will have been new and clean. You have no risk - really, 100% NO risk.

pinxhr,"too long, didn’t read. But to answer the original question in the title:

Being the insertive partner yields little to no risk at 0.11% per protectionless encounter for anal sex and 1.9% for the receiver. If the person was in the acute stage (the most infectious stage - aka the first 12ish weeks after infection) you could multiply that by 7.25.

To put it into perspective, receptive anal sex is the riskiest sexual act with a relative risk of 1.9% per encounter when having anal intercourse with someone with *unmanaged* HIV. [The risks for all other sexual acts fall dramatically below this.](https://www.aidsmap.com/about-hiv/estimated-hiv-risk-exposure) Add a condom into the equation, and this % goes down to almost zero. (Latex and polyurethane condoms are highly effective in preventing HIV)

**However**, if the Person with HIV is on medication and has an undetectable viral load, even when condoms are not used used this risk goes down to [zero](https://www.catie.ca/en/positiveside/summer-2017/uu) (known as U=U or treatment as prevention and is backed by the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/art/index.html), the [NIH](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/science-clear-hiv-undetectable-equals-untransmittable), [UNAIDS](https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/featurestories/2018/july/undetectable-untransmittable) and many other organizations based on data from the [PARTNER studies](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)30418-0/fulltext).)

So to answer your question, no - it’s really not easy to become infected with HIV even when you come into contact with the virus. It’s a weak virus that needs a perfect lineup of things in order to infect. Hit up [The World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids) for more info on transmission.

The reason HIV spreads is because people who do not know their status and aren’t responsible with regular testing spread it unknowingly. The only way to stop the HIV epidemic is for everyone to man up and get tested regularly.",2021-09-06 02:03:45,1

pdfz65,"I'd like to go ahead and say that transmission via saliva is practically unheard of. The poz person would have to be rockin a seeeriously high viral load for that to be an issue.

I have a feeling you're probably in the clear in this situation, but obviously testing is the only way to be sure. If the + person has an undetectable viral load, you're most certainly fine. 

However, I will express how deeply disappointed I am that he would put another person in harm's way simply for sexual gratification. In most places, it's illegal for him to not disclose his status to you BEFORE sexual contact and for good reason. I personally think it's pretty easy to live a normal life with HIV with how far medications have come, but still, I wouldn't wish it on anyone.

He could have at least told you sooner so you could have gone and gotten a regimen of Post Exposure Prophylaxis to completely prevent the chance of you contracting it.

If I were you, I would stay away from him. Someone who is THAT self-centered and would risk completely altering someone else's existence just to have a few orgasms isn't the type of person you want around.

what it does is DRASTICALLY lower the standards of safety and efficacy that must be met before pharma can SELL us their products. it also allows pharma TO CHARGE US WHATEVER THEY WANT for the unproven drugs. it forces insurance to cover it AT ANY PRICE PHARMA SETS. but not to cover it fully, so we'll still get stuck with big copays. ultimately pharma gets paid for using us as guinea pigs! and then, when people are harmed by any dangerous and ineffective drugs, this bill COMPLETELY SHIELDS PHARMA FROM LIABILITY FOR THE DAMAGES!

p9w3vj,">I asked multiple times if he has any std or hiv and he said no. 

Asking this question doesn't compel anyone to tell the truth - assuming they even *know* the truth.  As most new HIV infections happen amongst people who don't know they have it, the odd thing about asking ""do you have HIV"" is that the person who says ""yes"" is more trustworthy than the person who says ""no"" but can't provide evidence.

Keep that in mind.  Also know that someone with HIV but on successful treatment can't give it to you.  Scientifically proven.

Before you have sex, know how comfortable you are with certain things.  If it's condoms, it's always condoms.  If it's riding bare, then ask for a recent test result, or be cool with the risks.  And whatever criteria you put on your partner, be prepared to accept that criteria for yourself.

>He did have some small bumps around the under part of his dick head but it didn’t look gross or anything, it looked kind of normal like something I’ve seen before. I googled it and it came up as something called Pearly Penile Papules

100% normal condition.  They may not be attractive, and they may freak out people who aren't very hip on the ""seen many penises""-scene, but they're normal.

No matter what else you see, if there are no open sores, obvious warts, or pussy discharges, you're gonna have a hard time finding anything bad by just a visual inspection.

>He also had a white tongue

Also consistent with dry mouth.  A sign of dehydration.  Or recent/habitual alcohol consumption.  Thrush can present as a white tongue, but it tends to look hairy and the tongue will feel a bit meatier, and it's usually painful to the person who has it.

>had a rash on his neck that he kept trying to hide.

How sure of you it was a rash?  Rashes can have benign causes, without a doubt.  Sometimes we get them for no reason.  From an STI standpoint, the first thing I'd think is syphilis.  But people with HIV also get random rashes.

>Starting the first day afterwards I’ve felt tingling/ burning in my vagina where he rubbed his dick head on my hole, like right above my urethra and below my clit.

A of people experience post-coitus sensations.  I myself - a guy - almost always get an irritated urethra in the hours after oral sex for some reason.  I test regularly so I know it's just my body doing its thing and that it's just not found of others' saliva.

>After he rubbed it on me he said “now you have what I have”. I thought he was joking and told him to put a condom on. After he was done fucking me he said “Jokes on you I took the condom off halfway through” again

You found a keeper.  This guy probably gets off on freaking people out.  Either way, it's a huge red flag to even jokingly disregard someone's safer sex practices, and if there's anything you've learned from this experience, please let it be the power of saying ""no.""  The moment he joked about ignoring your wishes or said something fucked up like that is the moment you need to stop the fun.  You can find dick anywhere.

If I had to guess, he doesn't invite you to his home if he's intent on giving you something.  That kind of behavior is hugely criminal and nobody would want that tracing back to them.  I could be wrong, but that would be very interesting.

>Starting on the second or third day I started getting a burning/ tingling/ numbness in my feet and hands.

I guarantee you that's a manifestation of your anxiety.  When we start freaking out, our body draws blood into its core to protect its vital organs, and our extremities begin to tingle as a result.  We may even begin to feel a bit lightheaded or discombobulated, as from an evolutionary standpoint, our panic responses forgot that our brain is located in an extremity as well.

>The inside of my vagina burns and it looks irritated and a little swollen at the opening

It's funny what we see/feel when we go looking for it.   If you think something's wrong, you'll find it. Please keep that in mind. 

Also keep in mind that for women, UTIs are a frequent friend, especially sexually active ones.  It could coincidental or simply a normal result of your having sex.  Or it could be nothing.  But consider turning up your acidity all the same.  Cranberry Juice.

> I got tested on day 6 for all stds and everything came back negative. I’ve been swabbed for herpes and it came back negative and I have no bumps. The doctor gave me antivirals while I was there just in case but it’s been 6 days now and I feel like my symptoms have gotten worse.

1. No test at Day 6 for Herpes or anything else should be considered conclusive.

2. Your Doctor giving you antivirals at Day 6 is a stretch by him.  By Day 6 post-exposure, antivirals would have low efficacy as a PEP intervention.  The usual criteria is no later than 48-72 hours after exposure for expected efficacy.  Don't let these words stop you from taking antivirals, of course!  Take the regimen if that is your intent - it still has value, but commit to taking it completely or don't take it.

3. As for your symptoms ""getting worse,"" if you had an STI, it wouldn't really work that way this early in the game.  This is my way of saying, ""I'm not saying it's in your head, but...""

If you had HIV, you wouldn't feel bad for another couple weeks at minimum - it takes that long before your body starts churning out antibodies in numbers.  (That's kinda the whole deal with HIV and its staying power - it takes too long for the body to start fighting back that by then, HIV is already setting up shop and entrenching itself.)

>Everyday all day I look at my vagina checking it for new bumps or any changes, it’s all I think about, I can’t imagine having to live with this anxiety everyday for three months so I can get tested again.

See everything I've said above.  Your anxiety is through the roof and it's causing a lot of the tingling you're reporting.  It and your constant inspection is *causing you to feel (or think you feel) that your parts are irritated*!  Keep sticking your finger up your nose and you'll swear it's always bleeding on its own.

> I never even had an std before, but I don’t think he’s been tested. 

You don't know anything about him.  It's clear.  And that's not an insult to you, that's just me saying ""stop drawing conclusions one way or the other.""

>I just trusted him and made the biggest mistake of my life.

Don't trust your rando hookups.  Period.  But do just enjoy the dick.  

Make the decisions you need to make to keep yourself comfortable and sane.  If the dick doesn't want to cooperate, find another.

The only mistake you will make when having sex is compromising what makes you feel comfortable.

Don't think sex is a mistake or have some hindsight beatup session on yourself.  Be true to your wants and needs and conditions of enjoyment and you'll feel better after future encounters, even if that means a hookup doesn't end up happening.

**On Testing**

You can get an RNA test usually through your physician.

That said, the rapid tests are 90th-percentile accurate at about 3 weeks.  The 90-day thing is old news (but still good policy and that's why it's kept around).  The rapid tests may look and act the same, but they've evolved over the years and now they're very sensitive nowadays.

Get a pinprick test rapid test or blood draw (both better than ~~nasal~~ *cheek* swab) after Day 21.  Then again at Day 35 and again at Day 90.  Unless you have cancer or lupus or something (in which case you got bigger problems), Day 21 will provide you significant breathing room with a mid-90s certainty, and Day 35 will be nearly-definitive.

I used to be like you in so many ways (and in some ways still am.)  Please keep seeing your therapist and aim to build healthy relationships in your life *and with yourself.*  Honor your value and worth, and try your best to own who you are and what you do.  It's hard for many people to do this - including myself - but almost more important than succeeding at doing it, is understanding why you fail at doing it.  Recognizing your shortcomings and anxieties and triggers and why we look for sex where we do (and allow ourselves to do it with people who are lower than our standards should permit), is a huge step to putting life and one's actions and motivations into perspective.

Finally, I would suggest that knowledge is power, but not putting that knowledge into context is devastating.  Keep reading up more on STIs and HIV and what-not, but for heaven's sake, stay away from WebMD and other self-diagnosis sites.  Know how HIV therapy and prevention has evolved over the last decade and understand that tools multiple tools exist to ease your anxiety on the subject - again, Knowledge being one of them.  PrEP is another.  I would also suggest you get to know someone with HIV as well.  Not to complete your ""human trading card"" collection, but because it will help you humanize the condition. It doesn't define people.  And that goes a long way to making you feel more comfortable with the subject.",2021-08-24 17:39:12,3
p9w3vj,">It’s now been 12 days since possible exposure and the anxiety has been non stop constant crying and I can’t eat or sleep. I met this guy on a dating app and I thought he cared about me and I trusted him, after talking on and off for a few months I went to his house for sex. I asked multiple times if he has any std or hiv and he said no. I even inspected his dick and mouth before I touched him. He did have some small bumps around the under part of his dick head but it didn’t look gross or anything, it looked kind of normal like something I’ve seen before. I googled it and it came up as something called Pearly Penile Papules, god I hope that’s what it was.

&nbsp;

>He also had a white tongue, and he had a rash on his neck that he kept trying to hide. Starting the first day afterwards I’ve felt tingling/ burning in my vagina where he rubbed his dick head on my hole, like right above my urethra and below my clit. After he rubbed it on me he said “now you have what I have”. I thought he was joking and told him to put a condom on. After he was done fucking me he said “Jokes on you I took the condom off halfway through” again, I thought it was a joke. It was dark in the room but I looked and I think I seen the condom still on when he pulled out.

&nbsp;

>Oh and the next morning he texted me to say he felt no connection with me and he wished we just stayed friends and I haven’t spoken to him since. I’m so fucking scared that he knew he had something and gave it to me on purpose. I got tested on day 6 for all stds and everything came back negative. I’ve been swabbed for herpes and it came back negative and I have no bumps. The doctor gave me antivirals while I was there just in case but it’s been 6 days now and I feel like my symptoms have gotten worse. The inside of my vagina burns and it looks irritated and a little swollen at the opening.

&nbsp;

>I’m going today to get a blood test. Starting on the second or third day I started getting a burning/ tingling/ numbness in my feet and hands. Mostly in the bridge of my feet, heels and toes but also in my hands and wrists. I know it’s a weird symptom but I googled it and it said it might be a symptom of a viral infection. I hope he didn’t infect me with hiv or something else. I have no flu symptoms, just the weird burning in feet and pain in my vagina where he touched me. Maybe some tingling on my lip where he kissed me but that comes and goes. Everyday all day I look at my vagina checking it for new bumps or any changes, it’s all I think about, I can’t imagine having to live with this anxiety everyday for three months so I can get tested again.

&nbsp;

>I feel like my world is falling apart. I don’t usually use Reddit but I’ve been reading this thread everyday for a few days and it’s been helping with the emotional support knowing there’s other people going through the same thing. Sometimes I just feel so alone. And I feel ashamed and embarrassed my face turns red just thinking about it, I’m really convinced he infected me with something but I guess I won’t know for sure until I’m tested again. The uncertainty and what he said to me is what bothers me the most..

&nbsp;

>I keep replaying this night over in my memory, and I can’t get those words he said to me out of my head. I talked to my therapist a couple days ago and that did help ease the anxiety for a little bit but it always comes right back. I guess I didn’t realize just how fucked up this situation was until I started taking to people about it. I just keep thinking about it all day everyday. And if he did purposefully infect me I know I’m going to have a hard time proving it, I get tested regularly and always came back negative, I never even had an std before, but I don’t think he’s been tested.

&nbsp;

>I just trusted him and made the biggest mistake of my life. I’m preparing myself for the worst

Let me just add that I myself went through a scare a few years back and it was the most difficult thing I’ve ever had to go through. You have to stay positive and not think the worst.

As the other poster alluded to, bacteria and heartier viruses are a significant-enough concern. But even then, the length of exposure to environment plays a role.

Get the full workup at 30 days and you should be good to go.  If you're worries about HIV, 3 weeks gives you 90th-percentile confidence.

I get the allure of dom play, but even submissives need to assert their boundaries, often in the form of a pre-session discussion.

Remember: healthy Dom/sub play is about the *willing* relinquishing/surrendering of power, with conditions of its return. It isn't about having power taken from you without your consent.  That's bad practice and a good Dom would never practice that. A good Dom would treat the power you give them with consideration and not abuse it.

Not entirely true. It depends on what's on the dildo and how long it's been exposed to the environment.

I have OCD and a big obsession for me is health related anxiety. I went through a period of HIV obsessions. Basically it consisted of me constantly reading about HIV statistics and methods of contracting the disease. I worried about open cuts on my hand (papercut or something similar) and I worried that I'd contract HIV from handshakes. I did spend many sleepless nights reading and reading and reading countless websites about HIV just to try to get some relief from the obsessive thoughts. 

I got myself tested (which helped the anxiety a little), but the thing that helped the most was seeing a psychiatrist for my OCD and health anxiety.

The risk is if your dick is in their mouth at all.  And that risk pretty much requires your dick to have a sore on it or to be bleeding AND for the other person to be bleeding or to have a mouthful of pos cum.  Saliva doesn't transmit HIV.

In general shooting cum in someone's mouth is putting them at extra risk, because your sperm could enter a sore or cut in their mouth.

In short, your chance is basically nil but you could've gotten something else that lives in the back of the throat (syphilis, gonorrhea, herpes or chlamydia).  You also could've just gotten a little bit of friction or dry skin.",2013-11-28 02:40:19,2

Remember that physicians rely on the information you proved. 

If it has cleared up, and you haven't had anything else going on, then I think you are probably ok. Just remember to get tested. I ask for a test every time I got to the doctor, even if I don't need it. Physicians should be asking people if they want it, and I make sure they know that.

1pe03z,Transmission would be extremely rare. I doubt there's ever been a confirmed case of transmission this way. ,2013-10-29 03:09:19,1
1pe03z,"HIV Needs specific cells (CD4 cells) to reproduce, and saliva cells alone aren't good ""conductors"". Theoretically, if both partners had open sores, it would be possible to transmit it, but it would be VERY unlikely. 

IV drug use is effective as a means of transmission as you are pulling cells from veins (full of immune cells like the CD4 cells) and injecting them into another persons veins. Capillary blood is a smaller quantity, and likely has a different proportion of cell types. I would say that the two are not analogous, but that there are risks to both. 

Other factors would include a person's viral load, Antiretroviral treatment status, and the subtype of HIV.

HIV is incredibly bad at surviving outside of the body. UV light and oxygen are effective at destroying the defenseless virus. While bacteria and mold can form spores or use protective lipid layers, viruses like HIV had minimal defenses for certain environments. The inside of the body is where they do best, in dark, pH neutral-ish environments, with lots of places to reproduce. ",2013-10-29 03:36:04,1

The HIV tests that you have taken have a very high level of accuracy. If you were sick enough with the HIV virus to cause the symptoms you are experiencing, your antibody levels would be easily detectable using the rapid test, and certainly would have been detected with 2 separate tests. 

There are other diseases out there that cause the symptoms you describe. It's not HIV.  

Something else to consider is the effect that constant anxiety and worry have on the immune system. The most healthy thing that you could do is to get into some therapy and possibly medication for your hypochondria, which is an obsessive disorder and could respond well to treatment.

1pd7js,She told me to take a while and think about it and contact her if I wanted testing for anything. So I'm still freaking out.,2013-10-28 06:11:26,1
1pd7js,"Thanks for the kind reply.

I'm mainly worried at this point about seroreversion. I have scoured the Internet for probably hundreds of hours finding information on it, and I've found some case studies in which it's happened in end-stage AIDS patients. But I guess it can't be that common if there the only information is case studies. And I guess that wouldn't happen without OIs right?

Another concern is HIV-2 which I haven't tested for. But I don't know any Africans and I've never been there. Rare strains seem to, well, rare to be concerned about. 

Yet here I am, still pulling my hair out trying to find a reason my tests are wrong. It's funny, I actually started crying after the first negative test, not because I was happy, but because I was frustrated that my test was wrong and that I'd have to wait longer to start medication. The staff at both clinics think I'm bonkers I'm sure.

Anyway the second clinic I went to is actually a mental health center as well as an HIV/AIDS treatment facility. So I think I might schedule an appointment with that department instead. ",2013-10-28 15:11:01,1
1pd7js,"You're still freaking out because the doctor told you to think about whether you wanted to be tested again and let her know if you do?  

As the other two comments said here, you have had two negative tests after an encounter that happened 7 yrs ago.  You don't need another HIV test, you need to see a counselor for your anxiety.

1pcuhs,"Hi there, I'm a public health professional, and I coordinate medical education seminars for clinicians in the field of HIV. I have to disagree with the other response here. ARS doesn't manifest in all people who get infected, but when it does it happens immediately to 6 weeks after exposure. It's the body's response to the virus, just like it's response to any other virus. 4 months is too long for what you experienced to be ARS. Certainly get tested though. Your risk of getting HIV from a know positive female via unprotected vaginal sex is less than 1/1000 per sex act. ",2013-10-28 04:21:27,3
1pcuhs,"Hi, HIV clinic worker here. It can pop up four months after an exposure, though its most commonly seen 2-3 months. I recommend seeing a physician for a diagnostic test, so you can know for sure either way. It is definitely important to get tested now, whether or not you are positive. Either you are relieved and this is a near miss, or you are in the best place to possibly be to take care of your health. 

I worked with kids who were born with HIV in Africa, and now some of them have gone on to college. Always remember that diagnosis doesn't define a quality of life.

1okkab,"Hi. How long ago did these possible exposures happen? If it's been less than 72 hours you can go to the ER, tell them you may have been exposed. They'll give you hiv meds which will prevent infection (its called post exposure prophylaxis). If it's been longer than that, still go. There are tests now that can detect virus days after infection (as opposed to antibodies). Those are called ""4th generation antigen tests"". If on the small chance you did get infected, starting on meds so close to the time of infection means pretty spectacular results from medications (normal life span, risk of spreading to partners close to zero). Being the receptive partner of anal sex with another MSM (man who has sex with men) is the most risky scenario in sexual transmission. Don't freak out though, it's still a small risk in general. Also, this guy you're with sounds selfish and dangerous. Be careful if you stay with him. If he was smart and /or cared about either of you he wouldn't tell you it's ok to bareback.

You are obsessing over this. Because you are obsessing, you are being hyper-vigilant. When you are hyper-vigilant you start to notice things that you ignored before. Then you start to obsess and worry, which makes you stressed out. When you are stressed out you will show physical symptoms related to stress. Then you will obsess and stress over those physical symptoms. This will increase your stress and thereby increase the physical symptoms. This process will feed into itself until you're a nervous wreck. 

Stress weakens the immune system. Your physical symptoms are most likely caused by your stress levels. 

The likelihood, as others have said, is very close to nil that you have contracted HIV. 

Even if you have contracted HIV, worrying about it wont make a bit of difference. 

You will absolutely not see symptoms of HIV this quickly. There are a million things that cause a sore throat, one of which is beating the hell out of your immune system by maxing out your stress levels. 

So make a plan. Get an HIV test asap. Then wait 3 months and get another one. Believe the results. The tests are very accurate. 

Try to grant yourself the ability to accept the things you cannot change, and remember that worrying will just make you sick.

''Distal Symmetric Polyneuropathy
transparent image
transparent image
Incidence
Distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DSPN) is by far the most common neuropathy in HIV disease.(3,30,31,40)

In a cross-sectional study of hospitalized patients with advanced HIV disease, 35% had clinical and electrophysiologic evidence of this neuropathy. In a longitudinal study of outpatients, 55% had neuropathic signs or symptoms, and the estimated yearly incidence was 36%. Even among asymptomatic seropositive individuals, nerve conduction studies demonstrated polyneuropathy in 16%.

transparent image
Manifestations
DSPN can disable HIV-1-positive patients who are otherwise healthy. Associated pain and hypersensitivity can be intense, and is too often undertreated by physicians. Typical symptoms are tingling, numbness, and burning pain in the toes or over the plantar surface of the feet, often ascending over time. Neurologic examination shows bilateral depressed ankle-tendon reflexes and elevated vibratory threshold in the toes. There is often decreased appreciation of temperature distally. Brisk ankle reflexes suggest a diagnosis other than neuropathy or, at the very least, the presence of coexisting upper motor neuron disease (spinal cord or brain). Weakness, if present, is mild and usually restricted to the distal muscles, where muscle atrophy may also be observed. Severe or proximal weakness points to a different type of neuropathy (eg, polyradiculopathy), myopathy, or other neurologic diagnosis. Similarly, significant asymmetry in presentation usually suggests a focal neuropathy (eg, tarsal tunnel syndrome, other mononeuropathies) or other superimposed disorders. Electromyography and nerve conduction studies may be critical to localizing pathology and suggesting etiology.''

While it is possible to contract HIV from other activities, you're pretty much only at a worriable risk if you engage in unprotected anal sex. ",2013-10-03 14:49:26,1

Plus, even if you end being positive... You'll be fine. I have a few friends who are positive, on meds and undetectable. They have close to zero risk of giving partners hiv even without protection.

1nahzb,"Still feeling sick but on the mend.  New symptoms of muscels aches and I think my lympfnodes are starting to swell but not to sure.  Im profoundly tired though. Been sleeping all day today and yesterday.  Cough has gotten better and the consistent night sweats I had has seemed to go away for the most part.  But I have been using a little and dope has the ability to make all those symptoms to get better.  Defiantly have general sick feeling and malaise going on even when I am ""high"".  Im not using all that much.  I got burned so Ive done about $20 of street crap out of the $50 I spent today. 

I called my mother last night and I was pretty upset when telling her.  She seemed a little disappointed that I was using again because I just got out of a halfway house that i was in for ten months. She trying to calm me down saying that it is probably the flu not to worry and that I sound a little obsessed about it.  I did not give her all the details about the exposure I had though.  I asked her not to tell anyone else in my family and I hope she can.  One of my big concerns is to have my family go back to lose hope in me.  Their support helps me a lot because I don't have much hope for myself at this point and could really use theirs and with me going back and forth from recovery to relapse again if I were them I would of given up on me a long time ago.  My mother told me last night that they have already gone through this emotionally years ago.  That they have gotten used to the idea of me having Hep C, HIV and could very well die.  This is all a lot for me to deal with.  All I want to do is get high everything else is seems secondary and I know with a mindset like that my outlook is not very good.  Opiates give me very good temporary relief to my emotional problems.  I am a coward when it comes to dealing with feelings.  With dope my emotions can be overridden with blissful exstacy..... for a moment. I am just going on a rant now that I am sure is a bore to everyone else.  But it feels good to write it down even if no one reads/reply's to this.  If anyone does have anything to say let me just say how much I appreciate the time you spent of listening and commenting.

But while I was there they tested my blood for a bunch of other thongs too and saw that my lipase levels were high which is indicative of a viral infection also my lymph nodes are still swollen and shortness of breath and headaches. With the neg test results after two month after the exposer i would like to think that it is pretty much a closed case but with the symptoms that i still have i can not be fully certain. If i do come up neg i feel like this is a miracle that i should be studied because this does not seem to be regular. ,2013-11-04 04:47:34,1

As you grow up you're supposed to learn ways to cope with stuff, and somewhere along the way that became drugs for you. It is a really effective way to cope like you said - ""Opiates give me very good temporary relief to my emotional problems...With dope my emotions can be overridden with blissful exstacy"". You know the danger, you know it's only temporary but it's still so hard to give up. It's hard to remember why you would even *want* to stop using sometimes.

Isn't it weird that HIV scares you so much? With aids you have a good chance of having like 20 good years but plenty of drug users don't get that long. But I dunno it's one of those things...we're human, we're strong but weak. Your problem isn't lack of facts or anything. You can know stuff but still act the same as if you didn't.

Having the flu shouldn't influence the test results. Ask the counselor to be sure. False positives are around 2 per 1000 tests.

As pheel23 said, oral sex risk is very low, unless you have cuts, sores, or bleeding gums at the time.

Yes-- your chances of getting HIV from a needle stick from a patient with an unknown HIV status is extremely low.    IF the patient had HIV and you were deeply punctured, your risk would be 3/1000.  Also-- if you have a hernia from lifting things at work, THAT should also be taken seriously.  An incident report needs to be filled out-- OSHA would have a field day in this place.  Do yourself a favor and get a test-- ease your mind.  Also-- you should really talk to the employee health people about your work-related injuries.  I'm stunned by all of this.

1loau9,"No. There is a ""window period"" of about 3 months during which you could test negative despite being infected. This is because the tests detect antibodies to HIV which take a few months to develop (though there are tests that detect the actual virus but they are expensive and uncommon). If you get a negative tests 3 months after unprotected sex you are not infected. ",2013-09-04 02:01:46,2
1loau9,The '10 year thing' you read was probably referring to the fact that some people show no signs or symptoms of HIV for up to ten years after infection. ,2013-09-04 02:03:06,2
1loau9,"Don't confuse ""clinical latency"" with the ""window period"". The window period is the first 2-3 weeks that it takes for your immune system to start developing antibodies to the virus. Most initial HIV tests depend on the presence of antibodies, so you can get a false-negative test result if you test too soon after exposure. You need to give your immune system enough time to react to the virus before you can be tested reliably. 

After the initial infection, your immune system gets the virus under control and suppresses it for a period of time (up to 10 years) during which you may not have any signs or symptoms of infection. This is clinical latency. Your body will be producing antibodies to HIV during this time, so an HIV test would be positive, even if you don't have any symptoms.

Mainly when he tested positive they told him that judging by his viral load he had been positive or 5 - 10 years, but likely more. His father died of AIDS related illnesses. Because he was just in denial about the whole thing he pretty much decided he wasn't going to seek treatment and go through ARVs until he graduated college. As of last month he is now living with AIDS. He can no longer walk well and is slowly wasting away in our bedroom. I'm telling you this not to get you down but to let you know that you need to start treatment as soon as possible. Starting ARVs now will allow you to live a healthy life.

Depression is very common in HIV+ patients and as has been said, for many HIV+ people, the worst part of the disease is the toll on psychological health, not physical.

I can't tell you if you're being too hard on him, but I think you should try to understand how he sees it.  Not how you, or he, *thinks* he *should* see it, but how he *actually* feels about it, day to day.  Try to understand why he feels and thinks that way, and if the reasons are irrational, help him challenge his ways of thinking and his beliefs.  If he's outright depressed, he might need help for that too.

1icstf,"""Magnetic"" might be slang, but the term you're looking for is ""Serodiscordant"" relationship. 
I used to be in a serodiscordant relationship too, I was (and still am) negative, and my partner was positive.  I can totally sympathize with you over how hard it is to want to make your partner feel better when they're not.  For me, it sometimes felt like he wasn't appreciative of me being around at all.  Why wasn't he happy that he at least had me? 

The relationship ended for other reasons, though. 

I would just tell my (now ex) boyfriend that I thought he was good enough and that I loved him for who he was, all of him unconditionally.  I mean we still practiced safe sex only, of course, and that was fine.  If he'd say he thought his life was shitty I'd just say ""well I think you're fucking amazing no matter how badly you want to believe otherwise. so suck it."" or something to that affect...",2013-10-12 17:04:11,1

1id07x,"Sorry for the confusion and my bad wording. What I meant was equivocal, not unequivocal. The tests were carried out at a walk-in clinic offered by the NHS in the UK.  
They take a blood sample and check for HIV antibodies. I don't know if it's a Western Blot or something else. I didn't ask. The result can be positive, negative or equivocal. Equivocal basically means uncertain - the lab was unable to determine either way if antibodies were present. 

On the same day as the first equivocal test I went to a different clinic and paid for an insti-hiv test and this was negative.  

I then wwent back to the NHS walk-in clinic about 2 weeks later and had another test with them. This also came back equivocal.  

And the 3rd one was earlier this month.  

I've been in a 6 year relationship, which has been exclusive. We're not together anymore as bg/gf. I didn't expect to be positive based on our histories but we had unprotected sex throughout those 6 years.  

I will go and pay for another test I think. Probably HIV duo test or insti-test again just for piece of mind.

However if you take an uncertain antibody test like elisa, if it comes out positive, the standard protocol is to make a certain one like western blot. They should've done it on you already (3 times!). The only possibility as far as I know, if all of this is correct, is that you have been exposed to HIV and developed antibodies, but didn't get infected. You should consult an infectologist.

As it stands today, I've had 3 equivocal antigen tests, 1 negative viral load and 1 negative insti-hiv test. So confusing!! 

I will follow it up with another clinic tomorrow.  

edit: if the insti-test is correct, does that trump the other tests? I mean, if I tested negative on the insti-hiv test, does that mean I'm negative, regardless of the equivocal antigen tests?

1id07x,"What confuses me are the 3 equivocal tests. As I understand, they didn't give you a positive or negative result, they just said it was inconclusive, which I've never heard of. Elisa test (the more common, afaik) gives either a positive or negative result, and tests for antibodies. In the case of a positive result, it's not conclusive, that is, it may be a false positive. When you get a positive result, they immediately do a Western Blot test, which I understand is unequivocal.

The viral load detects virus above a certain count, which I don't remember. HIV positive people under treatment for some time get an undetectable viral load. This is, by the way, viral load on blood. The virus hangs around in reservoirs too.

The negative insti-test is a good sign to hang on to for the moment. Take an elisa test as soon as you can and go from there. ",2013-07-17 01:22:05,1

In terms of numbers, this means that about 2 in every 25 people who have HIV will receive a false negative test, and 2 in every 10,000 people without HIV will receive a false positive result.

I went along to Warwick A&E to chat to someone about PEP and risks etc. They run a GUM clinic during the week (UK Sexual Health clinics) and normally i'd just go to that, but its not open again until Mon, and mornings are appointment only yadda yadda.

Anyway, chatted to the people there. They rang up some experts but basically said, it was so low risk, they didn't recommend or feel the need to do anything. They even said its only worth going in for a test for peace of mind if I wanted to (I asked them about this, otherwise they wouldn't have suggested it.

There it is, right in your daily paper, on your tablet or computer screen, or wherever you get your news today — a headline about a great medical breakthrough everyone’s been waiting for:

Scientists on brink of HIV cure
Researchers believe that there will be a breakthrough in finding a cure for HIV “within months”
Yes, I read this exact headline recently. Here’s the full article, published in the English newspaper the Daily Telegraph. It details how some Danish researchers have figured out a way for “the HIV virus to be stripped from human DNA and destroyed permanently by the immune system.”

Furthermore, they are “expecting results that will show that finding a mass-distributable and affordable cure to HIV is possible.”

By all means, go ahead and read the full piece; you’ve got 20 free reads on the Telegraph website. As a treat, there’s a colorful stock photo too, showing red blood cells floating through some blood vessels, along with a few HIV virions glowing bright green — it’s very Fantastic Voyage-esque, minus Raquel Welch in her scuba gear.

But return here for a moment, please. I’m going to recommend three simple steps to getting the most from this — and other medical breakthroughs — in the mainstream media.

Step 1:  Be a skeptic.  As exciting as curing HIV would be, and no matter how much you’d like this to happen, just think for a moment about the plausibility of this story. Are scientists really on the “brink” of curing HIV? If so, why is this only appearing in the U.K. Telegraph? Trust me, this brink-of-cure has not yet appeared in peer-reviewed medical journals or at scientific meetings. And wouldn’t you expect this kind of advance, if real, to show up everywhere in media land?  Fire up that Google machine, and see what you can find about it elsewhere — lo, it’s the great following herd, all stampeding after that same U.K. Telegraph story. And importantly, here’s a New York Times piece on the very same general subject — HIV cure — and they don’t even mention these Danish researchers. Sure, the Times misses some stories, but it’s got some pretty impressive Health and Science sections — could they miss this, researchers ON THE BRINK OF CURING HIV, no less? I think not. So perhaps Mr. U.K. Telegraph Science Reporter is exaggerating a bit, for the sake of his story, of course.

Step 2:  Don’t be a complete snob — give the story a chance.  This is the other side of that same coin. Sure, it’s been a challenge curing HIV, but we’ve got that Berlin patient (now living in Las Vegas, by the way) — he’s cured. And the baby from Mississippi, he/she is cured (sort of). Plus, a whole army of smart HIV researchers actively tackling the problem as we speak. In fact, this very same approach cited by the Danish researchers — stimulating the HIV reservoir with an HDAC inhibitor — is a leading candidate for a viable cure strategy; it’s being looked at by many groups. Hey, why can’t Good Ol’ Ole Søgaard and his team be the first to succeed? The extra funding provided by the Danish government — 12 million Danish kroner! — is further evidence of the soundness of Professor Søgaard’s approach.

Step 3:  After all that, land someplace between Steps 1 and 2.  Take a deep breath. Read the full piece.
Discard the fluff: Brink of cure; 12 million Danish kroner; expect a cure to be available in months; you can distribute it to millions; it’s affordable, too.
Focus on the facts:  Some Danish researchers have some funding to investigate a potentially promising HIV cure strategy; they are testing it in a small number of people; some European scientists may soon be collaborating; we have no actual results yet to report.

After these three steps, all these medical breakthroughs — on HIV, cancer, Alzheimer’s, weight loss, male-pattern baldness, you-name-it — make a lot more sense.",2013-05-03 06:47:48,1

Correction to HIV story

""During the past week a story originating in the Telegraph entitled ""Scientists on brink of HIV cure"" has been published in other medias.

The article's title and subtitle suggests that a cure for HIV is expected in months. But this is not the case, according to the Danish researchers from Aarhus University Hospital whose work was cited in the Telegraph.

- We are not on the brink of an HIV cure, says Dr. Ole Søgaard from Aarhus University Hospital.
- We have an exciting study in which a potential anti-HIV latency reversing agent is tested in persons with HIV. We are making good progress, but there is still a long way to go.""

The authors state that they regret if anyone got the impression from reading the article that there may be a cure for HIV in the immediate future. Like many others, the researchers believe that a cure for HIV is an achievable goal, but most likely it will take many years, numerous basic science discoveries, and several phase 1/2 trials before a HIV cure may actually be reached.

2. Make sure the condom is pushed to the opposite you are opening it

3. Open condom wrapper but remember the condom can be torn by sharp objects. Only put on condom after there is a partial or full erection.

4.  Make sure there is no air trapped inside a condom because that may cause it to break. Squeeze the tip of the condom with your fingertips to leave some extra space in the tip, and put on condom, rolling the entire condom down to the base of the penis, still pinching the top. Be sure that the roll is on the outside.

5. Make sure the condom stays in place during sex; if it rolls up, roll it back into place immediately. If the condom comes off, withdraw the penis and put on a new condom.

6. After ejaculation has occurred, while fully erect pull out while holding the condom.  Put the condom in a tissue and place it in the trash.

I have a masters in public health and I work for a non-profit that trains clinicians in HIV.  Any test that tests for antibodies of HIV will give a false negative because you can have an acute (immediate) infection and not have detectable antibodies-- this is why it takes 3 months. You need to see an MD ASAP though, because if you really think you've been exposed to HIV they can put you on HIV medications in order to prevent the virus from infecting you.  Go to the ER and tell them you think you were exposed and that you need PEP (post exposure prophylaxis).  Your symptoms could be the flu-- or a cold-- or acute HIV.  Chances of getting HIV from an infected female are very slim per act of unprotected sex (something like less than 1/1000).

19g0bc,"I'm in the same boat. My boyfriend found out he was positive right as we were getting together, so we went to his doctor to ask for advice. There are three things you should do:

1- Get his viral load at undetectable if it's not already there. He and his doctor need to figure out which meds he needs, and then he needs to adhere to the regimen.  

2- Minimize your exposure to his fluids. I wouldn't use the same razor, toothbrush, or contact lenses. Kissing and oral exposure to his semen aren't likely to transmit HIV unless you have a sore or cut in your mouth. Use condoms for anal. Although his blood viral load may be undetectable, his semen viral load may not be. He may also have small blips in his viral load that may make the virus slightly more transmissible. 

3- Look into prophylactic Truvada. I just began that recently and haven't experienced any side effects (except for vivid dreams, which aren't bad). My doctor told me I can either take this on a daily basis or take it for a couple of days after a suspected exposure. I have elected to take it every day. This is now an FDA-approved use of Truvada, so your health insurance should cover most of the cost of it. I wind up paying only about $60/month after my medication deductible is covered.

The doctor you want to talk to about the Prep treatment is an infectious diseases doc. I found one near me who was very helpful, non judgmental, and I formative.

19g0bc,"Is your partner on meds? are they undetectable? are they free of other STDs?

If so, your risk of transmission is pretty minimal and you should be safe. I would still stick with condoms just for the extra bit of security, but if it was to slip/break, it wouldn't be the end of the world.

If you guys are getting serious, you should see your doctor, or preferably see his doctor (assuming his doctor specializes in HIV treatment) and discuss what your options are.

If you do become exposed to HIV, you can do PeP treatment, which is basically you take HIV meds within 72 hours of exposure for some time (few weeks), and has a pretty high success rate of preventing transmission.

There is also PreP --- which is much like PeP, but you basically take Truvada (an HIV med), daily - and it can prevent you from becoming positive. To me, it seems kind of silly to 'take an HIV medication every day for the rest of my life (with my partner) to prevent needing to take the same HIV medication every day of my life if I became HIV+' -- if your partner is on meds and undetectable, it's probably not worth it.

If you use condoms and he takes medications, and there are no other STD's present, your chances of contracting HIV are very low.  

All in all, anything you can do to reduce your exposure to his semen (or blood if you're into that) will reduce your risk of contracting HIV.  Oral sex is safer than anal sex.  Topping is safer than bottoming (though some people argue this, it's pretty well accepted in the HIV medical world).  Having him pull out before he cums if you're not using condoms, etc.  Reduce the amount (both volume and frequency) of exposure to blood & semen and you reduce your chance of contracting it.

18ywmb,"I agree with what you're saying.  I have seen these posts and responded to a few of them. 

Yes, I think there should be a FAQ or at the very least a link to a decent article on levels of risk such as http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/topics/basic/#spread

However, talk of deleting the posts crosses a line into doing harm.

The people who come here asking these questions are suffering and they are legitimately afraid.  Having been a young gay man who knew little about HIV/AIDS in the late 80s and early 90s, I can relate to this fear on a visceral level. 

The answer isn't abandonment, it's education. 

So a nice FAQ, and a few people who are willing to provide advice to those who ask should help a bit.

Frankly, the attitude of ""If I keep seeing this I'm going to unsubscribe"" sickens me. If these posts offend you so much, then hide them or don't click on them or don't respond to them. Simple as that. ",2013-02-22 13:58:49,6
18ywmb,"As someone who experienced massive HIV anxiety last year from a very low risk ie. basically no risk encounter last year. I can say with certainty that anxiety is very capable of creating allot of your 'symptoms'. It'll leave you a mess. The only real way to relieve you of your crippling anxiety is to get tested with the most accurate test you can get your hands on, so you can't ask what if. 

If you have a serious risk get tested at 6 weeks and again at 3 months, with a third or four generation Elisa. And if you had a major risk go to your nearest ER ASAP after the encounter and get on preventative drugs, not tomorrow or the day after, immediately! You only have a tiny window of 72 hours post exposure, the sooner the better though. I'd also recommend you go the hospital in your area that has the most experience with HIV exposure and research if possible, they will have access to the most current knowledge and research and assess your risk better.

I'm currently waiting results for my HIV test (third world public health system is slow, excellent but slow) I've confirmed that my exposure was minimal  to negligible. Yet anxiety don't work that way, and perhaps it's should be considered like a disease itself. 

I've had extreme stress anxiety since 3 years ago, which gave me horrible urticaria, eczema, sleep deprivation, extreme weight loss and more that sometimes can take up to a month. 

 I'm still scared (and I'll be scared until I receive my test results) but through a lot of effort I've managed to keep myself together and searching relief in more informed people than me has helped. Even started considering that if even against all odds my test results came positive, it's perhaps something that I can live with, and seeing the struggle that people with HIV do has helped me to rationalize my fear and remind me that even if everything  goes wrong, living it's worth the effort.

So please, bear with us, we may be annoying, but you aren't in our shoes. You don't know why this anxiety exists for us, you don't know which stage of our lives are we living, and you don't know how are we feeling. If I could stop feeling this way believe me that I'd do it. ",2013-03-05 17:32:38,3

However, the advice I would give you is similar.  You need support.  Seek out an HIV social worker or an HIV case manager to help.  If your test is negative, provide your girlfriend with whatever support you are able to give her.  I can't give you advice on whether you should stay with her or not - only you can make that decision.  I don't know your relationship or your history together.  I can tell you that you would have a future together, and the possibility of marriage, children, etc. if that's what you both want.  You have heard it already, but it is not a death sentence and many people are able to live fairly normal lives and normal lifespans with HIV.  I have many patients who are HIV positive and have negative partners who have stayed negative for years.  However, you're not a bad person if you can't stay with her.  It's scary.  Stigma and discrimination are very real for people with HIV and if you don't HAVE to deal with it, you may choose not to.

For now I'm the HIV negative partner in a serodiscordant relationship. I will retest in 3 months and again in 6. We have been highly sexually active for the 3 months we've been a couple including many instances of activities placing me at extreme risk of infection so although I'm overwhelmed with relief for now I will make efforts to steel myself for a different diagnosis in a few months' time.

I couldn't look at myself in the mirror if I left her because of this - each person of course has to make up their own mind but I would ask myself what kind of a worthless shitbag cunt would leave someone whom they professed to love, in that person's very greatest hour of need. Paradoxically I would expect and encourage her to leave me were our positions reversed.

I'm not leaving her over this. If it means I eventually become infected with HIV then so be it. This I am OK with.

In a way I think I just wanted to know that I hadn't been the one to give it to her. I don't know I could ever forgive myself had that been the case.

Thanks for the offer of help, my doctor co-incidentally is gay and heavily involved with the LGBT community where I live, and has many years of experience with patients living with HIV. I feel I'm in the best of hands with him.

It's much harder for men to get HIV from women, but it does happen. HIV does not live long outside the body. A man's penis is only exposed to HIV for the time that it is in a vagina or rectum. Men also may have fewer areas on the penis where the virus can enter the body. HIV can enter at the opening of the tip and through cuts or sores on the shaft. But if a partner has an untreated sexually transmitted infection (STI) like syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia, the risk is higher. These infections can bring more CD4 cells to the area of infection, or cause breaks in the skin, both increasing the risk of passing HIV. Meanwhile, women have a higher risk of getting HIV from men. Because HIV is in the man's semen, which can stay in the woman's vagina for days, her exposure time is longer after sex. Also, the vagina provides a much larger area than the penis does through which HIV can enter the woman's body.

18klkm,"Getting HIV isn't as easy as you might think.

However, you can make it even harder by making sure that you use condoms every time you're with anyone whose status you aren't certain of. 

You can get a rapid test.  Is there an LGBT community center near you? If you are in the US, there is a good deal of funding from the Ryan White CARE Act for free confidential HIV tests for people in high risk groups. Being a man who has sex with men (MSM) means that  you should qualify.  Where I am, we have rapid tests which take 20 minutes.   

So if you can, contact your LGBT center and find out about HIV testing and get it done and out of the way.  Or, as pheel23 said, if you have the funds, go buy a rapid test.  

It is hard to tell by symptoms because the early symptoms are those of a weakened immune system.  A cold can give you a weakened immune symptom.  Also, when you are worried about it, every little blemish or cough means that you've got AIDS.  Don't worry about it, its unlikely.

Even if you did  have it, it wouldn't be the end of the world. Modern medications (Anti-retrovirals) are very good at keeping the virus down and keeping the immune system up. It sucks to have to take meds every day, and being worried about infecting someone is no fun...but these things are manageable. ",2013-02-15 20:52:06,6

188dx1,"It is not impossible. It *is* extremely unlikely.

The way it has been explained to me is this: practically *all* cases where a man has claimed to have been infected from oral sex, the man also engaged in vaginal or anal sex with a poz partner. Last I heard, there is no record of any person who received HIV from oral alone. Even women who claim to have received HIV from oral sex have admitted to engaging in penetrative sex also. So it has been very, very, tough for researchers to pinpoint *any* transmission of HIV through oral sex alone.

Studies of serodiscordant relationships where the woman is neg and her male partner is poz have shown that women don't catch HIV from giving oral. Those that have contracted HIV from their partners have admitted to engaging in penetrative sex with those partners. 

So there are no 100%-you're-never-gonna-get-HIV stats that say oral is 110% safe. No doc is going to tell you there is zero chance of you catching HIV by engaging in oral sex. 

Even if someone HIV+ is on meds, their viral load is undetectable (not zero-there's a difference) there is a minute chance you can contract HIV by giving oral. Not a non-existent chance, just very small.

Receiving oral from an HIV+ person carries even less risk than giving oral does. ",2013-02-10 12:51:17,4

17zp6v,"The results are very accurate, you should get tested every 3 months as that is the size of the current window period, it could just be a coincidence with the timing  as HIV symtoms take some time to show up it could be a form of strep Penicillin will not do shit for it in most cases,( i have been their it sucks).
so here are a few thing you can do to ease your mind
1 if you are still having problems swallowing I would sugest seeing an ENT  they specialize in tat department 
2 if you still have the sores ask your doctor to have cultures sent out that will tell you exactly what you are dealing with if it is CA MRSA ask for bactrim

3 find your state in this list http://hab.hrsa.gov/gethelp/statehotlines.html they will find you someone to talk to.  ",2013-02-07 01:36:09,3
17zp6v,"One thing that should put you at ease is that HIV is not going to show symptoms as quickly as you saw them. At the very least it would take a week for the virus to load in your system enough to cause flu-like symptoms. Usually it takes between 2 weeks and a few months. 

So if you are basing your suspicions of infection on the spots in your mouth (24 hours later) and the flu-like symptoms (3 days later). These symptoms are unlikely to have been caused by an HIV infection from this partner. You were diagnosed with Strep.  That symptom is explained.

You seem to be experiencing a great deal of anxiety over this.  This anxiety itself could very easily cause a few of the symptoms you mentioned...

Here's a few things to consider:

It is unlikely that you have HIV.  HIV isn't that easy to get.  Obviously it's not impossible, but the odds of you getting HIV from the activities you described are fairly low.

Your initial two week test came back negative.  This is a very good thing.  Again, it's not definitive, but in combination with the low risk activities you described, it strengthens the case against HIV. 

Follow your Dr's instructions.  Get a test at 3 or 6 months just to be sure. But don't stress over it.

Finally...

If you did get HIV it would not be the end of the world.  I work with dozens of people every single day who have HIV and they're, for the most part, healthy and happy people. They have to be careful with sex and other body fluid related stuff.  They have to take pills every day and those pills can have different side effects.  The newer generation of pills has fewer of those. The cost of the medications and medical care are taken care of by Ryan White funds for those who can't afford it (In the US).  It is not only possible to live a full life with HIV, with good medication adherence and a healthy lifestyle, it's become the norm. 

It would be an adjustment, but it wouldn't be the end of the world.  So with that knowledge, release that fear.  You aren't facing a death sentence...regardless of your diagnosis.

But, as I said, the likelihood that you've been infected with HIV is pretty low.

Stop having unprotected oral sex with prostitutes.  That's just a bad choice. Keep seeing the doc about your symptoms...it's possible that your strep is back...see the doc about that.  I have no idea what to tell you about your lip sores. ",2013-02-07 07:58:41,2
17zp6v,"Penicillin did work but after I finished my prescription, it came back. Now they prescribed me a stronger antibiotic. I've been on it for 3 days but see no signs of improvement. If anything it is getting worse. When I used the penicillin it worked in the first 2 days. I also live in Canada so the sources you provided me wont be too helpful for me. I honestly thank you so much for replying back to me. It means so much. I feel so alone in this. I can't really talk to anyone about it since it is such delicate matter. Every time I think about it, I think about all the people I care about and how hard it is going to be for them if I have HIV. It's very hard to look at my mom without getting teary eyed. 

And again I apologize for all of this. I'm just very scared and suffering from anxiety. I don't know if I can make that 3 month mark. I definetly am going to go at the 6 week then the 3 month. Can I rest a little easier at the 6 week mark with the 4th gen combo HIV test? (If they do come back negative)",2013-02-07 11:56:38,1

ok now for the 3 month mark thing, not waiting will not give you now information with most clinics the tests the use have that window period, but the chances of infection from oral sex are low compared to other activities I can look up some numbers given some time.

now for the antibiotic issue - the penicillin did not really make it go away it just seemed like it ( well some of what ever it was was resistant) the ""stronger"" may work in a different way then the penicillin and you will have to give it time after day 5 I would call the md and let them know that you are not getting better.
did your doctor send out samples to be cultured ? that will be the best way to determine what is going on.",2013-02-07 14:28:17,2
17zp6v,"Well, my first thought is that your anxiety could be playing a pretty big role.  But, it could be something else. It's probably not HIV. 

Of course, I can't diagnose HIV or anything over the computer, nor can your mind be set at ease by anyone but yourself.

I am a gay man, I turned 18 in 1990, smack dab in the middle of AIDS carnage. The only thing I saw on the news was gay men dying of AIDS. I didn't have sex with anyone for a long time. When I finally did, the guy found out about 3 months later that he was HIV positive and we'd been having a pretty steady sexual relationship. 

I lived in a small town and knew nothing about HIV/AIDS other than it killed people.  I went, eventually about 5 months later, to get the test.  I was sure that I had it.  For five months, every sniffle and every blemish on my body was proof.

The test took 2 weeks.  It came back negative.

So, I get the stress...believe me.

It sucks that you've got all these unexplained symptoms. That would be upsetting.  You may have gotten something from her.  Have the docs checked for MRSA? Ask about that.  It's the only thing that you didn't mention that comes to mind. 

If you have HIV, you have it.  If you don't, you don't. There is nothing that your worrying about it is going to change. 

You have to accept, mentally, that if damage is done, it's already done. 

HIV is not likely.  It could be something else.  Take the full course of the anti-biotic.  Go back to the THAT doc if the symptoms don't get better and try the next thing.  Medicine is a trial and error thing.  It's a lot of ""Try this, and if it doesn't work, we'll try this, and it it doesn't work, then we'll try this, and if it doesn't work....""   

So you should stop doc hopping.  Find one you can trust and stick with them. Different docs have different experiences and it will make you crazy.

Last thing.  Don't underestimate the effects of anxiety on your body. Talk to your doc about the anxiety this is causing.  Anxiety can cause physical symptoms. 

You're going to be okay.  Just trust your docs and try to do some pleasant things and see what you can do about this anxiety.",2013-02-07 14:56:51,2

It was done in a heterosexual serodiscordant population, but it should parallel results seen in MSM.

They gave the positive partner antiretroviral therapy either immediately or they waited until their CD4 count dropped below 250 cells/mm3 and then looked at the rate at which the uninfected partner became infected.

The study showed that there was a 96% decrease in HIV transmission when antiretroviral therapy was started right away, suggesting that effective antiretroviral therapy stops HIV transmission as long as RNA levels are undetectable.

The other study for you to look at is the iPrex trial, which specifically looked at preexposure prophylaxis in MSM. This was kind of the opposite design of the HPTN052 study - again they look at MSM couples in which one partner was HIV positive and the other HIV negative. This time, it was the uninfected partner who received antiretroviral therapy. They looked at the rate at which the uninfected partner became HIV positive and found that there was a 92% decrease in the risk of becoming infected with HIV in HIV-1 people who actually took the drug (eg, had detectable levels of drug in their blood).

1jh1rz,"HIV only transmits via blood or sex fluids, though it has been detected in saliva the amounts are way too low to tranfer it via that route. So if you're worried about transmission via her glass pipe or 'shotgunning' you should be safe. Though there are a million other diseases that can probably be transferred via those routes though.

1dnd7v,"Getting tested is great, but this isn't the best video for how to do a DBS (dry blood spot).

* You should hold the safety lancet with your other hand while using it. Don't brace it against the table.

* Try not to touch your finger to the DBS card

It is great to get tested! Knowing is better. However, I feel the way he talks about getting tested almost gives the impression that it will keep him ""safe at the club"". Testing does not prevent HIV. 

Thanks for sharing.",2013-05-04 12:15:06,1
1dnd7v,"If anyone with aversion to blood is squeamish to **this** , you'll hate having HIV.  3 to 5 vials of blood several weeks apart for 3 to 6 months, then quarterly and maybe if your medication is stable and well tolerated it will go down to 3 to 5 vials twice a year. ",2013-05-04 17:11:20,1

1m4eey,"Even if you did get it (which you didn't), symptoms wouldn't start to show until a few weeks after - not the morning after.

Frankly, the symptoms of acute HIV infection are shared with the common cold/flue/etc that using the ""I got a cold after doing X"" - that there is a pretty damn high chance you simply have a cold. Toss in paranoia and overanalyzing everything --- your fine.",2013-09-13 02:30:28,1

1m4eey,"Trust me, you don't need to worry about THAT exposure.  You washed your hands, that's what you needed to do and it's done.  Also, seroconversion takes longer than two days to manifest for most.  That said, go get tested! You can buy a rapid test at the pharmacy or you can hit up a free clinic if you don't have insurance.  

I'm not saying you shouldn't be worried about getting HIV, everyone should.  I'm saying you should know more about how you could possibly get it and how to avoid it. Knowledge is power!",2013-09-10 20:19:09,2
