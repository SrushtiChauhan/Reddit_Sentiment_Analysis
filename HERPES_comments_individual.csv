60xlxh,Hi there. I'm wondering if we are still allowed to post photos? I don't see this option when trying to create a post. :),2022-03-23 07:02:58,1
60xlxh,[deleted],2017-07-20 16:33:17,1
60xlxh,"To post photos in the sub you need to first upload them to an image hosting service such as imgur.com and then include the text links to your photos/album in the body of your post. So you basically need to create a regular post (ie a text post) to do that. 

People sometimes get confused because, when attempting to create a new post in this sub, the option to create an ""Image or video"" post is greyed out and not selectable. That's because an ""Image or video"" post is a particular kind of post that  just includes a post title along with a photo or video and nothing else -- no post body or description of any kind. Those kinds of posts are common in porn-type subs such as r/gonewild, or in photography subs like r/earthporn.  We don't allow those here because, without any accompanying description, they aren't helpful.",2022-03-24 00:01:17,2
60xlxh,Thank you so much,2022-03-26 23:40:04,2
npznfp,Interesting to know the majority has successful disclosures and had sex with non positive partners,2021-06-02 03:16:36,22
npznfp,I loved reading this. Thank you for sharing. I'd love to participate in any future surveys!,2021-06-13 04:17:11,12
npznfp,I wonder if anyone who found they have herpes via blood work and got tested again via blood and came back negative. I been reading online that the blood test for HSV can come back with a false positive or even not properly diagnose someone who has it and it’s experiencing symptom,2021-07-16 21:32:04,9
npznfp,"Good survey, hopefully it'll alleviate alot of the anxiety people have. People tend to go on and lead pretty normal lives",2021-06-19 21:01:22,6
npznfp,As someone who was diagnosed days ago this was interesting to read thank you,2021-10-17 18:36:31,6
npznfp,"What a powerful survey, and the comments at the end are profound. Proud fothe people in this group. I hope this gets shared with the medical community. We talk often of how to ""get word out"" - having worked in two professions who's sole purpose was communication and education, I'd target the medical community directly first and big name folks secondly because the medical profession will eventually hear this and put pressure on the big name folks to broadcast it (even better if we get both to help at same time) - it'll take time and persistence - it's both education and marketing; we educate and market to medical pros. My thoughts this morning.",2021-06-24 13:43:40,6
npznfp,"This is fantastic. Thank you SO much for taking the time, making the effort and sharing the results. Wow. Not sure if you've done this before as I am new to this forum and haven't had time to explore your website yet, but it's a great start and assessment overall with many good suggestions at the end in the comments section. As a scientist, please LMK if you want/need any help with handling/calculating the data in the future. Although the pie charts seem relatively straightforward and accurate, the bar-charts do not. They are confusing, both in terms of the axis labels related to each bar, missing information/descriptions and the percentages appear to be way off which doesn't make sense. Not sure what happened there but everything should always add up to 100% total. Regardless, this and you are awesome. Thanks again!!!",2021-07-13 16:24:15,4
npznfp,this is exciting,2021-06-02 19:16:42,3
npznfp,I feel like the answers on here are less accurate especially with the depression and suicide I see people on reddit being so depressed over this also I had a suicide attempt over herpes was in hospital,2021-09-08 09:49:37,2

npznfp,Hi! I am wondering if anyone takes ongoing medications (antivirals or other) to lower transmission and prevent future outbreaks.,2021-09-01 15:48:32,1
npznfp,"Is herpes that much more common in women? 

Sorry if that’s a dumb question - I’m new",2021-09-23 22:01:05,1
npznfp,"Really good work. 
I’m very curious about the differences by gender  though. The majority of respondents are female. 

In my mind I imagine men would respond more favorably to discolosure than females, but this may be complete bias on my part.

Would it be possible to see how the different genders fared in having relationships after diagnosis?",2021-09-29 16:38:43,1
npznfp,It's crazy that there is people who tested positive with blood test and just let that be it. When it could be possible that they don't have it at all,2021-10-14 11:44:53,1
npznfp,"This was really helpful but I would have also liked to see the breakdown between the experiences of a Man interested in women, a Women interested in Men, Men interested in Men, Women interested in Women, Etc etc in regards to how the others responded to their diagnosis when told, how dating has been, have they been able to date regular people, how many of the non hsv people accepted them and moved forward with sex, dating, relationship, etc etc, has any of them performed oral on you or have you to them, did either catch anything, where their mind is in regards to their diagnosis, did it change the way they see life, did it bring any positive aspects into their life (Example: Maturity), to them how do they view HSV in relation to how the world functions, have they come to terms with it, do they now understand why people before them or the person that gave it to them didn’t tell them, did their Highschool teach STD’s the right way, by giving them the actual statistics and clear descriptive details of all details pertaining to it, do they feel the medical industry and colleges are teaching it wrong, did anyone’s symptoms get worse after getting the vaccine, did they disclose their diagnosis to anyone and if so who, how many people know, if they kept it private, is it because they are private people, they didn’t want it getting out that they had it, is that also the reason why they may not have disclosed their diagnosis to future partners, are they on a Lysine Diet, if so, what do they eat, have they noticed any increased irritability with the foods they have eatin, have any of them come a crossed foods that they noticed are directly associated with triggering symptoms, if so what foods, 

And have any of them realized that between doctors only allowing a test for it if symptoms are present, 75% of people not showing symptoms, so more than not don’t know they have it, condoms don’t protect you from it and that everyone whether they were taught right about it or not is risking catching HSV

So with all that being said HSV doesn’t put you in a Black or White Situation but that from a Moral Aspect it places you in Limbo


Edit - Has anyone heard of The dating app called positivesingles.com and if so have they joined, (if you don’t want to download the app cause you’re afraid a friend or family member may see it who doesn’t know your diagnosis - You can still use and access the App just by going to the Site instead of downloading the App - which is nice because that’s what I do)",2021-10-16 11:47:22,1

npznfp,"Hi! I’m seeing that people are having trouble accessing the link to the survey. I’ve tried all I know to do in order to fix it and it ONLY works when you click the link, and when it offers you to “reload” you just have to avoid that and click outside that box to show the results from a mobile device. I’m working on the survey for this year and with a survey service that costs money I hope.",2022-03-09 18:27:33,1

npznfp,I know right. We’d never know if people hadn’t felt safe sharing.,2021-06-02 03:17:04,13
npznfp,"Yea but the Breakdown of the Percentages showing whether they were a Male or Female would have helped a ton, as well as if their partner or the person they disclosed it to that accepted it was Male or Female, the numbers of times they disclosed it as well as the number of times that people turned them down because of it would have also been very helpful as well",2021-10-16 11:53:37,6

npznfp,I’m in this boat right now. I’m pretty sure I have it because I had a horrible outbreak but the test was weird and inconclusive. Wasn’t done by my primary care,2021-09-23 07:33:24,2

npznfp,"Hey there! Thank you!!! The information is lengthy so if you’re at a mobile device you won’t see it fully. Try looking from a desktop. 

I believe the 100% comment is in reference to the check all that apply questions and the “other” responses so those only show what percent of people selected the options, so those won’t add up to 100%.",2021-07-13 16:35:51,1
npznfp,I have you all to thank for supporting this effort.,2021-06-02 19:29:53,2
npznfp,"So take this into consideration…. People who NEED support, seek support, get a little help, get to a little bit better of a place. My podcast audience primarily consisted of those people. I tapped into my networks and asked that people share the survey with people they know, so I THINK that outside that range of people, those who didn’t know about these resources were more likely struggling. I looked at the analytics and not many people from Reddit came to the site to have taken the quiz. Most was from my podcast, insta following and then the ransoms would’ve been from me harassing people to tell their friends. Make sense?

On the site spfpp.org, there is one survey I’ve done that is FAR MORE reflective of what you’re saying. It’s from 2019 though. 98% of people said they were depressed (not diagnosed with depression) 6% attempted suicide and 48% of people had suicide ideation after diagnosis. So you’re right about the difference in data.",2021-09-08 10:00:35,3

npznfp,Hey no dumb question…. Men just didn’t take the survey. My hypothesis is avoidance.,2021-09-23 22:23:16,6
npznfp,"Great question. I think more women are willing to take the survey, be vulnerable and seek support for navigating emotions, whereas men are more closed off emotionally (traditionally I mean). So it isn’t that not many men get herpes, know they have herpes, or don’t listen to this podcast, it’s that they’re uncomfortable with emotions or to them it just genuinely isn’t on their list of priorities to explore in the stigma space.",2021-09-29 16:40:53,5
npznfp,What’s crazy is that there are people who haven’t been tested at all who have it.,2021-10-14 11:45:32,5
npznfp,I appreciate this input. I’m pursuing funding to do more in depth research (pray for me lol) and this is great info to take into my data collection!!! Keep in contact please. I do little data collection on my insta @honmychest like this often.,2021-10-16 11:49:52,1

npznfp,Interesting,2021-07-30 14:17:59,2
npznfp,Wait how often were you getting tested in that period?,2022-01-23 04:13:26,1
npznfp,"Hey man. Ahhh Gotchya. That explains it. In that case you could do it based on the number of items checked instead of number of peeps. Multiple choice does skew it in relation to the latter but now I understand the numbers better. So each number (not percentage) reflects the actual number of times each was selected correct? In which case each one becomes it’s own 100% scale more or less. I see. 

BTW I Couldn’t  see everything even on my desktop (the display of the bar graphs are shifted, cutoff which sometimes happens depending). Thanks again!!",2021-07-13 18:21:24,1

npznfp,Thanks for your understanding! That makes more sense - I didn’t think the ratio was THAT different,2021-09-23 23:21:34,2
npznfp,"Many don't get tested either.  Using the whole ""I didn't know"" or ""I don't have that"" because they've never been tested or have an actual diagnosis. Avoidance & ignorance. Although I've seen this true for women as well...",2022-01-24 15:35:46,1
npznfp,Agreed. But as a man I’m curious if men get the same majority positive response to disclosing. Most stories we read and hear are from the perspective of women. I imagine partly men are less likely to seek out a diagnosis and be in the position in the first place…,2021-09-29 17:15:15,1

npznfp,Oh nooo sorry that was interpreted. I mean for people to be more informed about just how seemingly inevitable exposure is. For people to become educated and most prepared for being diagnosed or disclosed to. People need options to navigate stigma. More people living with herpes are “okay” than aren’t.

Edit: I should clarify that occasionally I've asked / have been asked if I have any STIs, but I've never had a partner specifically ask me to get a full panel done (including HSV) before sex. Most likely because when I was a bit younger in college, people just aren't having those conversations around testing as frequently as they should :).

ts67cp,Following,2022-03-30 14:06:39,2
ts67cp,Have you tested ?,2022-03-30 15:19:47,1
ts67cp,Tested positive for GHSV1 so does that automatically mean I have it orally?,2022-03-30 15:41:55,1
ts67cp,"No it doesn’t mean you also have oral. Problem is you could have it and be asymptomatic but wouldn’t know until you get an OB. 
Possible you had ohsv1 before getting ghsv1 but that should have protected you from getting it in a separate location ( usually does )

Or you contracted both ohsv1 & ghsv1 at same time and only has an OB in one location. 

I’m asymptomatic but my mom has always described the beginnings as a slight tingle / burning at the spot that then ends up having the sore.",2022-03-30 15:47:38,1
ts59e3,No. We aren’t a constant contagion. You can’t get herpes from a hot tub.,2022-03-30 13:20:06,4
ts59e3,I suppose if you were having an episode of viral shedding and were rubbing your genitals against her in the shower or other wise it could happen. But just a quick brush against seems unlikely to transmit enough viral load to infect her.,2022-03-30 13:34:11,3
ts59e3,Thanks. It's a silly question I know but I just wanted to know incase she worries when we are being intimate without having sex.,2022-03-30 13:21:39,2
ts59e3,"Thanks. If it was more than just a brush and let's say I was rubbing against her ass, could that cause a sore to appear on the same spot? As with HSV2 it can be anywhere below the waist right?

Just trying to get an idea of what I can and can't do",2022-03-30 13:36:39,1
ts59e3,"Yes if you were rubbing against her butt without a condom on & happen to be having a viral shedding episode then possibly you could pass it to her. Skin to skin transmission.  Taking the daily antivirals helps but still some risk even with no OB .  Not sure if skin on a persons bottom minus the anus itself is as susceptible to transmission ?  
Mucul areas or ones that have some cut or abrasion there would be more risk. 

Maybe someone else can weigh in on this.",2022-03-30 13:57:06,0

ts52d6,"Try getting on Valcyclovir - it helps so much. Both of y’all should get on it. It’ll reduce your viral load and the frequency of outbreaks, possibly to the point where she won’t have them anymore.

I feel for y’all and hope things get better, I promise it’s not the end of the world. Yes she should have been informed but if you didn’t know then you didn’t know, you can’t help that so don’t beat yourself up. The shame and stigma attached to herpes is not helpful or necessary and honestly having herpes isn’t a big deal especially once you’re treating it with something like Valcyclovir.

i did stop taking them after my inital OB and the shooting pain got a lot worse. i also dont want to take them long term, but i dont think short term use is more harmful than pain---at least for me. its possible your body just needs a little help to adjust and you can quit them down the road. have you looked into supplements? some people swear by lysine, red marine algae, and propolis.

Honestly, if she didn’t get it from you it’s highly likely she would get it or oral hsv1 within time from someone else. I bet you both have been with people before that had it too and didn’t even know. If you two have a connection and have love , why ruin that over something you cannot change/ hard to avoid anyways? It’s best to have support during it as well. Especially in the beginning of your diagnosis. I think once you both realize the stats and number and see how common it really is you will move past it.

trzb8v,My experience was very similar. Standard std panels do not include herpes tests. Unfortunately you have to ask for those and most places encourage you not to unless you are showing symptoms or have an outbreak. I’d get in as soon as you can and get a hsv SWAB. That will give you the results you need. Blood tests can give you false results sometimes but swabs will not give false positives .

ts09lm,"This is called autoannoculation. This CAN happen but it is only likely  to happen during your primary outbreak or rarely during an outbreak. After your primary outbreak your body builds up antibodies to herpes meaning that it is not only harder to catch the same herpes strain from others but also from yourself. So the longer you have herpes the less likely you are to re-catch it in a different area. When you are having an outbreak is when you are the most contagious in general, to play it safe make sure to wash your hands after touching a herpes sore with soap and water. (Simple warm water and bathroom soap kills the herpes virus no need for harsh chemicals)

trucya,Hsv1 is typically oral and hsv2 is typically genital but hsv1 can also be on genitals from oral sex. I believe hsv2 orally is pretty rare.,2022-03-30 01:02:43,1
trucya,"Everyone is different, but I have never related to any of the positivity on this board even a little bit. It's all either incompatible with my life circumstances or utterly hollow or ill-conceived. For me, it really is all bad, and I'm not exactly new.",2022-03-30 05:03:25,1
trucya,Right. Please let me deal with the worthless knowledge that I am asymptomatic for an incredibly confusing virus that I don't even know the location of and will scare away potential partners who are  ignorant of their own diagnosis.  Nope.,2022-03-30 15:00:32,1
trucya,"Too many false positives. 
Imagine testing for something which has no clinical symptoms or prognosis. Huge chance of false positive which has impact on romantic life",2022-03-30 04:40:03,2
trucya,Yea and now he's screwed and has to tell people. I mean he may not but I would feel the need too and I'm not confident and I'm really shy and haven't even been on a date since we broke up.,2022-03-30 01:53:57,1
trucya,"I’m agreeing.  In the absence of the ability to swab ourselves daily for a year, to see how infectious we actually ARE, you might as well succumb to the paranoia and go live on a mountain with monks for the rest of your life.",2022-03-30 16:03:28,1
trucya,"Right. I tend to agree. But the consensus on here seems to be that everyone should allllllllways be aware if they have it. 

It really is a weird situation. 80-90% don’t know they have it. Going around living life normally. But some are told they must find out if they have it. Even if they have no obvious symptoms. 

Idk what would help take the stigma away though. Having more people test to find out they have it. So we realize how common it is. Or to go on with out constantly checking. And not worry about it.

Like eventually one will realize they have it if they pass it on to a partner. Idk what to do for my self honestly. Was negative at 5 weeks.  Dunno if I should test again.",2022-03-30 05:02:53,1

trucya,"I know. I’m just saying if you were with him for 3 years, you more likely than not have it, if you don’t that’s great but purposely not getting tested Bc you dont wanna know is just like getting tested and ignoring your diagnosis. And I feel it would be unrealistic to not think that would weigh on you in future relationships. That’s allll",2022-03-30 14:05:42,1

trucya,If the next person I date asks for full panel testing I will test then. Otherwise I'll just get the regular 5 panel. Or when I have kids I guess they test then. In the meantime it's not something I want to deal with.,2022-03-30 14:58:48,1

tqzbcy,"I was diagnosed 3 years ago, got it from an ex I was in a long term relationship with who cheated on me and passed it to me that way. I always practiced safe sex and getting tested annually, but it still upset me because I was lied to. It took me about 1 year to finally accept it, but I think time is different for everyone. I’m at the point now where it doesn’t even bother me. I literally get one outbreak a year, maybe 2 if I’m really stressed about something. So in 3 years I’ve had 3-4 outbreaks. I know I’m probably on the luckier spectrum, but I also know people who are asymptomatic and also people who take medicine if they deal with constant outbreaks. When you really read the facts on herpes it’s not life threatening (in almost all cases) and most people who have it don’t experience THAT bad of outbreaks. Again everyone is different. Also, majority of the population has some form of herpes, but how many of those people know they do? Look at it in a positive way, at least you KNOW you have it so you can practice safe sex. The only issue I see with herpes is disclosing, but if you practice/surround yourself with partners who aren’t crappy disclosing won’t be so tough! I hope you figure it all out :)",2022-03-29 21:41:00,3

troqhc,"Ooof I am 100% in his position. Met a girl about 2 months ago, we connected REALLY quickly, hit it off very fast, had amazing communication and such long and deep conversations. Before her, I was single for 5-6 years and never had sex during that time. I had an extremely toxic relationship with someone that really messed me up emotionally and mentally and needed to find myself, learn to love myself again and whatnot. Anywho, the girl that I had just recently had a relationship with and I started to get sexual about a month ago after several amazing dates. We spent a weekend together at her place because we both had it off from work. Definitely had quite a bit of sex and then that Monday rolled around and she texted me telling me that she wasn't feeling good and was having flu-like symptoms and was extremely sore down there. We both just kinda thought it was from sleeping together quite a bit and having somewhat rougher sex. I got home to get ready for work, took a shower and started to notice 8-10 bumps that looked very similar to razer burn or ingrown hairs around my pubic region. The bumps were raised around the hair follicles. They really weren't painful at all and had no white heads, they were pretty far from one another and weren't bunched up. I did some google searching to see what it could be and saw that it really didn't look like herpes and looked way more similar to folliculitis. My dumbass just kinda shrugged it off and assumed maybe it was from the sex, we both were freshly shaved so maybe the friction was causing this and was going to give it a day or two to see how things healed. She went and got a COVID test for the flu-like symptoms and that came up negative. She then went to Emergicare because it started to hurt when she peed and was super painful for her to sit. Few hours passed and she sent me a text as soon as I got off from work saying we need to talk and if she can call me.

She called and told me that the Emergicare doctor said that she had a herpes outbreak going on down there. She said that she recently got tested a few months back ( not sure if she asked for an HSV test at that time ) but said she was completely negative for everything that they tested for and that I needed to go and get checked out immediately because I was her only sexual partner since her last test. She told me that she needed some time to think and talk with her sister, I apologized several times and told her that I had no idea, had never had any cold sores around my mouth or anywhere down there. I never once put the blame on her or said she could have been the one to have it first. I called the closest emergicare, they were closing in 10 mins and told me to come in the next day. My dumbass decided to go to the ER because I had really no knowledge of HSV and was in complete panic. I went, got visually diagnosed by the ER doctor and she told me it definitely looked like herpes and that they don't do the HSV blood tests and that would have to get done by a general practitioner. Left and paid $2000 ( the bill would have been $8000 without healthcare ) I texted her as soon as I got out and told her what the doc said. She never texted me back that night. I talked with family members that night for a couple of hours, did A TON of research and ended up not sleeping at all. Watched tons of YouTube videos, browsed reddit for hours and clicked on just about every google link out there that had 'HSV' in it. I am a firm believer that knowledge is power and doing the research and figured out that it's not life threatening, learned about the stigmas, found out that many people get the flu-like symptoms when they get their first outbreak and found out about how people can have it for years and be asymptomatic and then pass it along through viral shedding without an active OB. I got tested back in 2019 when I had an appendicitis, they did bloodwork and a urinalysis to make sure I didn't have any STDs and all came back negative, but I have no idea if they tested her HSV since it's usually something that needs to be asked for.

I was truly devastated. I felt beyond awful for passing this along to someone that I truly cared so deeply for, I was extremely scared and had a pretty bad mental/emotional breakdown. Things were going so great and so unbelievably amazing with her and I and then this happens. At that point I didn't even really care that I had it, I cared so much more that I most likely passed it along to her. Like I truly absolutely wished that I would have known so I could have disclosed to her, taken the daily anti-viral suppressants and done everything in my possible power to not spread the virus to her if she wanted to continue with the relationship post disclosure. There's so much regret, so much self-disappointment.. like I honestly could have seen myself falling in love with this girl because of how quick we connected and had such similar interests and I just felt broken and defeated. I never really even mourned for myself, anytime I would talk to friends or family members she would constantly be the one I talked about. My mom had to stop me one time and ask, "" But how are you doing? Are you alright? ""

The next day I called off from work, called the doctor's office as soon as they opened and scheduled an appointment with a doctor who wasn't my usual doctor because he was booked. Went to the appointment and the doctor really wasn't much help. She wasn't very informative, didn't really seem to care and just told me to use condoms which I knew wouldn't help. Gave me ani-virals and she didn't even want to see the lesions or culture test me and just told me to come back at the start of April and get blood work. I was pretty furious. Got home, texted her the results, checked social media and found out that she had removed our relationship status, removed and blocked me from all social medias. That was what broke me and sent me in quite the downward spiral, I texted her to see what was up and and a few hours later she said responded and said she is depressed, in a ton of pain, wasn't sure if she would ever forgive me for the pain I caused her and just needs time. A week went by and I texted her a few times asking her how she's doing, if I could do anything for her like grab some groceries, walk her dog for her, grab her food, come over and just chat or even do chores for her and whatnot around her place and didn't hear anything back.

She finally texted me and said she was in a terrible place, was unable to go to work for 2 weeks, was depressed and somewhat suicidal, was going to see a therapist and was afraid she might have to quit her kitchen job that she loves very much because working in a kitchen it's hard to stay dry and not sweat which can cause OBs. We texted for a good 2-3 hours and then finally I just never got a text back. It's been 2 weeks since then, still nothing. So I've basically come to the realization that it's most likely over, she is probably very upset with me even though I had no idea and wouldn't have wished this upon my worst enemy let alone someone that I had such crazy feelings for. Like you, she left me on read numerous and has ghosted me and I feel I have done everything in my power to be there for her, the ball is in her court and I am stubborn as well and she can text me at this point if she wants to because there's just not much more I feel that I can do. Honestly, losing someone that I got so close with so quickly was just absolutely heart wrenching, hurt way more than the diagnosis and makes me feel beyond terrible. I wish I could have helped, I wish she would talk to me because my anxiety and overthinking gets the best of me here and there. This past week has been much better though, I started a gym membership and started working out everyday for an hour two to get my mind a little straight. I've been eating better foods and things that are high in lysine and low in arginine. Taking daily supplements such as Zinc, Red Marine Algae and L-Lysine. Definitely nervous for this Friday because that is when I get my blood work done. Downloaded some motivation and daily affirmation apps to remind myself that I am not a horrible or terrible person and that life moves on, herpes is not the end of anything. It's just a minor speed hump in the road and I need to do everything in my power to not let it take control of my life.

I apologize for the book and I am sorry that he is ghosting you at the moment, it feels awful and re-opens the wound quite a bit when you go a day not getting a message back. I just don't get why someone wouldn't want to talk with someone else who is going through the same exact thing to talk it out, figure out triggers or have someone there to back you up and support you during this stressful ass time. He probably feels awful, feels like he let you down and is going through depression pretty hard. I hope he comes back around for you but at the same time if you need to begin your personal healing process you do that! Everyone copes differently, seems like you and I have coped a little more in a mature way. The way I see it, I have it. It happened. It sucks.. but I am not going to let this control my life, I am not going to let the 'what ifs' win and I am not going to let it manifest myself into a deep dark depression. I just want to continue with life, continue working on becoming the best person that that I can and keep pushing for my hopes and dreams.",2022-03-30 05:11:31,5
troqhc,"I will say I'm in his position... and idk what to do.. I honestly didn't know because I didn't have a full on first outbreak when I got it. AND even though I requested to be tested for everything my gyno neglected to explain that hsv wasn't included in everything. 

I would reach out to him, if you want to potentially keep seeing if there is a relationship, because in our head we are racked with guilt over the position we put you in, doesn't matter if we knew or not in our heads. I have guilt because i should have known i wasn't being tested, or i should have been more responsible with who i slept with..i feel guilty because i wasnt able to give him the choice of making an informed decision... the same choice that wasn't given to me (though I'm 99% certain the person who so kindly shared with me knew) but at the end of the day we also took your choice away

I know I'm struggling with reaching out, even though he took it in stride and told me he wasn't mad at me, because idk if he really wants to hear from me.",2022-03-30 00:24:54,2

I had my first outbreak a year into my relationship. My SO never got tested for hsv and neither had I beforehand. We both had skin issues prior to me having herpes so it was hard to say who got it from who. He is convinced he gave it to me because he may have gotten it from his ex and had been a carrier. (I have always had protected sex and he has not) A few months after my first outbreak he had his. He didn't tell me about it at first because he said he felt ashamed but figured I'd see it anyway.

trnjhq,no worries at all!! so typically a higher igg number will say you’ve had it for at least 3 months. a lower igg number is possible even if it’s an old infection but that’s rare. have you had sex with anyone recently that you think could’ve given it to you?,2022-03-30 04:39:02,1
trnjhq,"My last two parters were tested both negative and before that I was not sexually active for, 4 years had a baby so I know I was tested then for herpes. so it’s just all odd to me. Sorry, another question if you don’t mind… if that was an outbreak and it was so minor… would that be a good indication that if I was going to have future outbreaks that they would be similar to that or less then ? In a bit of a panic, constantly checking for bumps and scared I’m going to accidentally trigger an outbreak due to food, drinking etc.",2022-03-30 06:39:33,1
trnjhq,"most times when std testing is done, they don’t test for hsv, so i assume all those times it wasn’t done unless you look for what was tested and see it was. i assume your future outbreaks will probably be very light and unnoticeable. will you let me know the results of your blood test?",2022-03-30 15:03:31,1
trnjhq,Thank you for that share of opinion. I will absolutely let you know. Would it be ok to PM you when I do receive it? Especially for potential other questions?,2022-03-30 15:12:12,1
trnjhq,yeah you totally can dm me!! did they say how long it will take for your results?,2022-03-30 15:39:00,1
trar7q,"You accept this is a newly acquired aspect of you and that you are still you. Also remember there’s so many experiences left for you to experience. Not all experiences involve sex… in which you’d disclose to that lucky human who is granted access to that part of you.


I am smiling and enjoying life and I have hsv and know of the pain. If you saw me you would never ever know. Unless we slept together of course 👀.


If you don’t touch the person you love (assuming one who knows about your hsv) you’ll lose them. They’ve accepted you because they love you.. they would want to be touched by you. That person would be with you for you… a l l  of you. Give them your all. Love hard.

In a previous post, you mention a positive IgM, but not a positive IgG. Have you been tested again? Do you know if you have herpes? The IgM is a terribly unreliable test. 

I'd make sure you don't have something like BV or yeast happening, and if you don't know for sure, get an IgG test done.

My doctor said it could be transferred from something (not necessarily a direct kiss) also that it’s possible I’ve had it since childhood and have not experienced a bad outbreak. She did say it’s possible to transfer it to other areas of my body, so when I apply my creams use a q-tip and wash my hands immediately. Maybe you transferred it to yourself?

tr6ilg,"Firstly, everything you’ve said gives me the sense you’re a really good person.

Secondly, it does unfortunately sound like an infection but get the sores swab tested to confirm.

Thirdly, I know it’s hard but I think you should tell him. His reaction will give an indication as to whether he’s the right partner for you. Guilt and remorse would be a healthy response from him - he should have told you to avoid this exact scenario, so does need to take responsibility. The level of empathy and maturity of his response will indicate if you want to continue dating him. 

Finally, you’ll get through this and be okay!",2022-03-29 16:27:41,15
tr6ilg,"I'm sorry, please don't beat yourself up. I think the transmission happened from your crush based on your story, even if your trying to divert away and take ownership and claim it may have been you. I think it's wrong that he is letting you think that you didn't get it from him, even though he exposed you, had unprotected sex, and withheld his status from you. You breaking out shortly after his is a clear indicator. He's probably scared you might leave him now. Which is a  
normal response after a situation like this or disclosure, so don't let that hold you back from whatever you want to do. Sounds like your on the fence but willing to look past and continue, I think it's best you tell crush about the sex with the friends circle guy so if you both choose continue a relationship you both receive yourselves and eachother of all the heavyweight and can both restart with a clean slate. You both made a mistake. And I think it's best you tell friends with benefits so he can get tested as well. Even if it doesn't work out. You won't be doomed to celibacy forever. That's what this thread is here for, to help you navigate and educate and accept and learn how to continue your life, and not let the stigma hold you back from being happy and comfortable with yourself.",2022-03-29 17:05:18,5
tr6ilg,"With the timing and the symptoms you're seeing, it sounds like an outbreak. You should really go get swabbed & tested just so you can know and be put on an antiviral to help with the symptoms.

But you should tell your fwb, he deserves to know so he can look out for symptoms and get tested. If he's your friend and you can both have a mature conversation about it, all will be fine. It would be worse to not tell him, he finds out it was transmitted to him & then finding out it was from you.

I haven't like-liked someone in many years so I can't really remember the feeling of rose-colored glasses, but my two cents as an internet stranger is that biting the bullet or mitigating your risk were options and he chose not to do either. I understand that not disclosing doesn't make you Hitler, a physically trivial disease shouldn't preclude you from spontaneous sex for the rest of your life, but weigh these actions of his critically when you can as part of your process of getting to know him more.",2022-03-29 21:05:55,3

trshco,"Disclosure is super important! Some people have weaker immune systems than others and will end up with severe herpes symptoms. It’s majorly important you give them a choice pulse disclosure falls under informed consent. Telling someone after the fact is so much harder to do and is met with much worse reactions. You can hide it but in a long term relationship that becomes difficult and can cause major trust issues with your partner. Even if you limit not disclosing to 1 night stands you are limiting yourself with that person. Like what if it was the best sex  of your life  or if you really clicked with them now you need to disclose afterwards.

tr0t0c,"I've had 2 successful disclosures. The most recent, my current s.o. is a really great guy and I think maturity has to do with it. The first one, real nice guy and we were friends before dating so I had kinda already talked about it with him because of the guy I was seeing before him.

So I guess it would be maturity and caring people would be what made them successful?",2022-03-29 18:43:28,6
tr0t0c,I will say I disclosed to an ex partner and he said “it’s not a big deal I have it too.” I didn’t get it from him when we were together a long time ago but that alone made me feel better cause I know he has a lot of sex.,2022-03-29 15:07:26,3
tr0t0c,Remind me in 2days!,2022-03-29 15:00:22,2
tr0t0c,"I’m not sure what characteristics to look for. 

I’ve had two positive disclosures so far. A guy I would hook up with time to time wanted to meet and he was trying to have sex. I told him I can’t do that right now. I think he may have thought I was on my period lol because he said let me know when you can have sex. I took a deep breath and I said well the reason I can’t is because I have genital herpes. He’s older than me has more life experience and knew all about it. He even made me feel like it’s not a big deal. It’s a big deal to me. Anyways, I didn’t text him or anything after because maybe he was just being polite. Well he ended up hitting me up again. 

The second disclosure I met a guy off of tinder and we were hanging out. I think it was the third time we hung out we were talking about relationships and stuff. For some reason in my head I thought this is the perfect opportunity to disclose because I was feeling sexual tension with him. I asked him would you date someone that has a disease? He said it depends what kind of disease if it will kill you or not. 
I said not life threatening. He brought up herpes and as he was talking about how it isn’t a life threatening disease I couldn’t stop smiling because I have this secret. I then blurred out “I have herpes”. He wasn’t phased by it at all. I felt the weight float off of my chest it was a crazy feeling. After we separated that night I had high anxiety of being ghosted. He didn’t ghost me he didn’t treat me any different he sent me a text the next day asking what are we going to do today. 

Now both times I was tipsy I haven’t disclosed sober yet. Right after I told both people I could feel myself being numb like my body and mind already had it’s defense prepared. It’s a crazy feeling. Sorry for the long post but I know how it is to come on this Reddit for answers. I think even reading others posts helped me start disclosing to people. 

Best of luck to you <3",2022-03-30 08:34:47,2
tr0t0c,Honestly at this point I’ve had more successful disclosures than not - it really has to do with the maturity level. Guys in their late 20s and older seem to have no problem with it at all. Someone I told recently was like “Doesn’t everyone have herpes???”,2022-03-30 13:20:16,2
tr0t0c,"I think being open minded, educated and the bond you have with the person is an indicator if it will go well. Prior to my successful disclosure with my current partner, he had already helped take care of me post major surgery, I’m talking helped me brush my teeth, fed me, I was nearly immobile from surgery for six weeks, he woke up Literally every hour and slept on my couch to keep my pain medication pump flowing (had to push a button on the pump every hour for the dose). I have HSV2 so we only kissed prior to disclosure. I knew after that, he would be open. He was fully aware of how common HSV is before I told him which I figured he would know and he never judges anyone. FYI I’ve noticed if you say cold sore versus herpes people really don’t freak out and it’s not lying. You’re literally just not using the word with the stigma. All I said was I have the HSV strain that causes a cold sore/minor skin rash that shows up below my waistline (my initial OB was on my bikini line). I’ve only had the one initial OB so far and am on suppression therapy so the risk is relatively low plus female to make transmission is a lot lower. When I tried to drop the stats he just cut me off and said he was so relieved I wasn’t breaking up with him because I was too scared to disclose. Then he said he figured he will eventually get it since it’s so prevalent. Good luck. I was terrified and in total depression when I found out I had it, thinking I would never date again. After a few months of research I accepted it and just said fuck it I’m not going to be ashamed of this anymore. It’s not life threatening it’s just annoying. Ive has shingles outbreaks before and honestly that pain and annoyance is worse than HSV. And the surgery I had changed my outlook HSV is the last thing on my mind.",2022-03-29 22:00:14,1
tr0t0c,Maturity and willingness to learn about HSV have been the common denominator for me. It’s important to be very thorough in your disclosure atleast that’s how I’ve been and have had a good success with the process with different partners.,2022-03-30 00:55:30,1
tr0t0c,"Maturity, emotional stability, groundedness - not being melodramatic.

I've never been rejected for hsv and I think this is because I'm very choosy about who I disclose to.

Sometimes you'll meet someone who is a lot of fun, and have a good laugh - but when serious things come up in conversation they can't really deal with it. Maybe the best way to describe this is ""fair weather friends"". I like to have quite deep conversations and debates, even on dates, and if I feel like a person cannot talk about their feelings, or reality, or they give off that vibe of ""everything is awesome and great"", that says a lot to me that they aren't very good at handling or confronting more difficult issues/emotions that crop up. 

People who deal in melodrama, bitchiness, gossiping, and are unable to keep things private (such as telling about their own friends personal life)... just not my cup of tea... since you know that disclosure is something that would likely provide them with entertainment, even if in the long term they were accepting of it.

I have had one person who accepted my diagnosis, told me it didn't change how she felt and wanted to keep seeing me, but who ultimately had a huge amount of anxiety around catching the virus, which ended up souring our relationship. She was too anxious and too much of a hypochondriac. My spidey senses picked that up at the beginning of the relationship, she was not emotionally grounded and very much a ""everything is great all the time!"" type of person. That's not real life. And I should have trusted my gut sooner. But she was I believe trustworthy, and respected my privacy.

I think for me all of this adds up to respect. Respect for where I am at in my life, respect for how I live with hsv, respect for my right to privacy and normalcy, respect for my feelings and concerns. If I feel respected and have their acceptance that's the goal. I would take respect but rejection over acceptance but no respect. Imagine being accepted by someone who doesn't respect you - that to me would be far worse than rejection.",2022-03-30 10:54:28,1
tr0t0c,"The people who tend to be open minded in general tend to be open minded to talk about STIs  and sexual health. I have been diagnosed for 10 years and have had  20+ partners since diagnosis. None of them to their knowledge have genital herpes some had cold sores. I am currently with a guy who is completely HSV negative he works at a blood lab and took a test just for shits and giggles.  He knows about my herpes I disclosed and he is completely fine with it and accepts the risks. There are plenty of people like this who do not care. Sitting around and waiting for a cure it’s silly you’re rejecting yourself before anyone even has a chance to think about it or reject you or accept you. You are putting limits on yourself before giving anyone else the opportunity to consider anything. People get rejected every day for a plethora of different reasons Sure there are people who ghosted me especially on tinder but as I talked to my friends I realized they got ghosted too and it wasn’t because of herpes it was because dating apps are cesspools in general. Dating nowadays sucks for so many reasons if you want to pin it on herpes go for it but that’s not the only reason. I was diagnosed with ghsv-1 at 19 and I thought my life was over I didn’t tell a soul cut off friends and everything because I felt so disgusting and gross. But eventually I put myself out there and had a few positive disclosure s and i began to realize that I was the one creating the stigma for myself.. The more people I told the less it weighted me down. Think of it logically friends should care because it doesn’t effect them. The only people your herpes effects are the people you are sleeping With. Friends are supposed to be your support system and if you tell them your story they should not judge you And they will learn from you And your experience. Hell you May even help a fellow herpes person out becuase if someone discloses to your friend after you teach them about herpes they will be more understanding and knowledgeable about it. But that’s up to you. I’ll attach some links that have seemed to help people and if you need anything please dm me.I’ve had it for almost a decade at this point and have a pretty good handle on it.

Or choose the petty route and point the finger back at him, then laugh, and just lie, and say that he has it too. Start ridiculing him back cause then he would just look silly for making fun and ridiculing you for having something that he (may or may not) really have, but other people won't know that, because people are miseducated about hsv anyways and will just assume he has it too. 

You can also just laugh it off and make him look crazy, and say he was just making things up to slander you. Or both. (Or if you choose, you can take the power back from him and just come out with your status on your own accord.) Then what can he hurt you with if you already beat him to it? Tik tok has really good hsv awarness threads where many people are so open about having hsv and their sex life after their diagnosis. It could be liberating. Maybe some jerks would laugh, I think there are many who would rush to your defense. That's just me. I think even if you chose to, keep record of the blackmail texts.

It probably wouldn't win in court and you're going to spend money on a lawyer pursuing it  BUT it is a valid threat. 

If I was a douche bag and my boyfriend told me he was going to sue me for doing something, it would deter me.

But I unno.

You could use a threatening letter like  I have obtained legal counsel  and will sue you for pain and suffering damages blah blah 

OR  If you don't want to go this route .. you can put it out afterwards like.. what ?  This is petty. Spreading lies about me because you're scorned.  That's really pathetic of you. 

Or.. you could tell him he's an idiot and he thinks it's going to damage you when all it does is tell people that he also now has herpes.  So what he's trying to do to you will do it to him.
You could add the extra..  and you gave it to me... 

The last 2 are going to cause extra stress on you but it's an option. 

A guy from work told everyone I gave him herpes  and I just denied. But obviously a totally different scenario.

I'm so sorry you're going through this stress. Nobody deserves their private medical business to be spread around. I hope you transmitted it to him and I hope he has a horrible outbreak   :)",2022-03-29 13:58:09,4

I take moments like this to be a great social cleanser of the scum lol.

I personally would probably accept the claims are true and be really matter of fact and educational about it in response cause I'm not secretive about my herpes and I found that when I told friends and family about it in such a way people were not only accepting and kinda but actually really impressed and proud.

I'd probably be upset if someone I trusted didn't disclose something like this before we had sex, but I'd also understand and forgive them. I would stop avoiding them and talk to them. It's not a given that he will understand but it's also not unlikely.

You made a mistake when you were drunk. And it doesn't excuse it, but it's clear that you feel awful and are genuinely remorseful. But for that to matter you need to own up to it. None of what youre doing now helps this boy, it only protects you from facing dealing with his response.

He deserves to know that he had unprotected sex with someone with herpes. He deserves better than to be ghosted by a close friend after sex. And he deserves to be the one deciding if he forgives you for this. You're taking that away from him.

Honestly when I disclose, I don’t love to use stats because at the end of the day, they have to either be ok with the possibility of getting it and showing symptoms or not. The issue with stats is that there’s a lot of people out there that are carrying it that don’t know so the stats are mostly based off of those who actually showed symptoms and tested positive. I try to educate and be transparent. I don’t tend to have many issues with it and frankly find many other things to disrupt my life more than genital herpes.

The risk for HSV-2 transmission from men to women was 28.5 transmissions per 1,000 unprotected sex acts (95% CI, 10.8-74.1) and 1.3 male-to-female transmissions per 1,000 protected acts (95% CI, 0.4 to 4.5), yielding a 96% reduction in HSV-2 transmission with male condom use (95% CI, 84%-99%).",2022-03-28 23:02:14,5

tqhdaj,">My wife is struggling with yet another cold sore

Does she take herpes medication? If she experiences cold sore that she considers to be problematic, she could take herpes medication when a cold sore occurs to minimize it's extent and duration. Herpes medication is most effective when taken at the first sign of an outbreak, so it would be adviseable for her to get a supply of herpes medication to keep on hand in advance, for when a cold sore occurs. She could get a prescription for enough medication to treat *multiple* outbreaks.

Furthermore, if she considers her outbreak frequency to be problematic, she could also consider daily suppressive medication. For about half the people who take daily suppressive medication, it stops them from getting outbreaks *entirely*. For the other half it usually reduces outbreak frequency by at *least* 50%.

For a review of the various herpes medications and their standard dosages for outbreaks and daily suppression, please consult pages 20-21 of *The Herpes Handbook*, published and made freely available by herpes expert Terri Warren for online viewing or download here: [LINK](https://www.westoverheights.com/herpes/the-updated-herpes-handbook/).

>However, I've never had a cold sore. How is it possible that I could be married to someone for more than 20 years and not have contracted the virus myself?

There are numerous possibilities here. First, it is entirely possible that you've never caught it from your wife despite being married for 20 years.

Another possibility is that you *did* catch it from your wife but have never experienced symptoms.

And yet another possibility is that you actually had it already, before you started dating your wife, and your pre-existing infection has prevented you from any further infection from your wife. (with rare exception, a pre-existing herpes infection protects against any further infections by the same herpes type, in any body location).

More than half the population has hsv1, the vast majority of those infections are oral, and a full 70% of people who have it orally don't even know they have it because they've either never experienced noticeable symptom, or experience symptoms so minor that they mistake them for something else, or have forgotten about symptoms they experienced long ago but haven't experienced since.

Furthermore, even with IgG blood testing it's difficult to rule out the possibility of a person having hsv1. Because standard IgG blood tests miss a full 30% of hsv1 infections.",2022-03-28 22:06:18,1

tq96kn,"My initial outbreak was horrible.  Over a month later, I was still suffering with muscle pain, fatigue, nerve pain and I had a couple small subsequent outbreaks.  My doctor said there wasn't anything I could do except take my daily Valtrex.  So, I started eating healthy and walking a couple miles every day and made this my focus, rather than the herpes.  As a result, my stress lowered and within a couple weeks almost all of the pain was gone.  Rather than focusing on herpes, I focused on myself and my wellbeing.

When I had my initial outbreak and was diagnosed with herpes, I was devastated.  I thought my life was ruined and that it would never be the same.  When the pain wouldn't go away and after the additional outbreaks, I was convinced that my life was over.  All I could think about were all of the things i wouldn't ever be able to do again.  I almost accepted that I was going to live the rest of my life alone with chronic pain and stress.  I wanted to give up.

But, I didn't.  I didn't let the fear, shame and stigma win.  And neither should you, OP.  When shitty people do shitty things, it says everything about them and nothing about you.   The person who gave you herpes is irrelevant.  This, and what you are going through, has nothing to do with them.  But, it has everything to do with you.  What matters most is your life and how you choose live it.  You are in a bad place and you are not being kind to yourself.  If one of your friends confided in you that they were going through this, would you think that they are a failure and that their life is ruined?  Would you tell them that?  Of course you wouldn't.  You would be kind and encouraging.  Yet, you aren't kind and encouraging to yourself in this situation.

You are not a failure.  Your life is not over.  Your big dreams aren't lost.  They are right where you left them and they are waiting for you.  Herpes may seem insurmountable today but I promise you that it will get better.  And, I promise you that there will be a day that you stop thinking about it.

You've got this.",2022-03-28 17:03:16,9
tq96kn,"I totally get how you feel. There are days I feel okay about it and days where I get in my own head and beat myself up. However 80% of the population has some for of HSV, majority go unnoticed which is the cause of most of the transmissions. Everyone is bound to get it at some point in their lives. This virus sucks bc of the stigma and potential recurrences, but if you take care of your immune system (eat healthy, exercise, manage stress), you’ll be able to prevent likelihood of recurrences and transmission. This doesn’t affect your long term health so don’t let it take over your life and define who you are. Really shitty that person knew they had it and didnt give you the option by disclosing. Take it day by day and don’t think about the what if’s and dwell on the past. Definitely go see a therapist and be active in support groups as that will help knowing you’re not alone. 

I’m also struggling with this mentally and emotionally but what helps is looking at testimonies on YT or watching vids of ways on how to live with herpes. Educate yourself on the virus and you’ll come to realize it’s not as bad as advertising, the school system, society and pop culture has made it out to be.

Focus on your mental health and working through the stigma we have ingrained into ourselves. The only reason we feel like shit about it is because we too were once the people scorning at others for getting HSV. Forgive yourself, remember cold sores cannot physically stop you, only you can mentally stop yourself. Time heals everything, its fresh now, but dont hesitate to speak to a therapist or at the very least get your butt in gear and work at your mental health.

Id just double check with the pharmacist and see what other healing creams they have on offer too.
Not sure the exact time frame of healing but wouldn’t be more than a week. Physically the haemorrhoids will come and go and you’ll always have the lump but the itchiness will disappear.

* They break in the shower two weeks later. The pain I experience are from the raw skin rubbing when I walk, run, or have erections (especially in my sleep in my underwear). 
* I have a brief couple days of fever, flu symptoms. Swollen lymph nodes. 
* Several weeks later, while the sore is still not healing quickly and there is some yellow sticky pus, I start getting more symptoms. Very swollen foreskin, white dry skin, taughtness of penis, white bumps.
* The white stuff and swelling is diagnosed as Balanitis and male yeast infection, triggered by whatever the initial infection was (the assumption was Herpes, but it turned out to be Syphilis). 
* General fatigue sets in. I feel a bit weaker, not crazily so but enough that it's a more noticeable struggle when running and working out. 
* Rash on my trunk (chest and back). Almost looks like chicken pox. Doesn't itch.

I have ghsv1 as well and trust me I’ve suffered from the stigma & have tried to do the same mental gymnastics about avoiding full disclosure but I could not deny someone the choice that was taken from me. 

I highly doubt most undiagnosed partners would agree with your assessment if they found out that it was genital after the fact. OHSV and GHSV are simply not the same. You are setting yourself up for far more difficult conversations down the road If you find yourself in a committed relationship and never told them the full truth of your diagnosis and they find out later. You do you, OP, this is just a strangers opinion. 

I personally feel that we break the stigma by being fully open, honest, and educating, not by withholding information.",2022-03-28 17:44:02,8
tq4t3v,"Interesting perspective. I would agree for the most part but the psychological effect of ghsv vs ohsv is day and night. Sure it is a perception created by society, but nonetheless has a detrimental impact on an individual. 

Just look at past threads of people alienating themselves to protect others because they don’t want this happening to them. Sure it’s a cold sore in another part of your body, but nonetheless, but the mental toll of worrying about transmission to your loved one or someone else generally is far too strong. This obviously depends on how you initially perceived your primary outbreak with physical and emotional pain, and how much you’re willing to risk someone else to go through the same journey too. Just my opinion",2022-03-28 09:21:38,16

tq4t3v,"My doctor flatly told me to stay off the internet and disclosure was not necessary, but to avoid sex when symptomatic. It’s a personal choice. A lot of people here are hurting. I don’t blame them, but please don't seek approval from an internet forum made of people in pain to make your decision.  Seek advice from medical professionals and trusted friends and family.

HSV (especially type 1) should be presumed with every sexual partner absent a negative test, because the reality is most partners people sleep with will have it. Unless the CDC changes its guidance away from blissful ignorance, I very much struggle with the emotional burden society puts on a select few, despite the clear reality that the majority of people have this virus.

People all over this sub will kiss without disclosure but claim disclosure below the waist is necessary, which is a logical line I actually can't understand - hence my thoughts above.  

Every time you kiss someone, or engage in any form of sexual activity, you are taking a risk that someone has HSV-1 or 2.  If that risk is too concerning for someone, they should be discussing with their potential partners getting tested together. Disclosure becomes a lot easier when 50-75% of your potential partners also test positive.

I would feel very differently if HSV was screened for as part of a normal STI panel, but that's not the case - that means every time someone voluntarily engages in sexual activity without a mutual and recent HSV test (among all the other relevant infections), they are providing informed consent.

I know this is an unpopular view on this sub - I also respect opposing views.  I do believe that posters should understand some of the beliefs that many professionals in the space subscribe to that counter the views most vocal here.",2022-03-28 14:43:23,15

You either disclose the thing before you can spread it, or you don't.

No, that's not quite what they're saying. They're talking about genital hsv1 specifically. Even the experts are split on that one.

While there is general societal consensus that ghsv2 should be disclosed, there isn't consensus regarding ghsv1. And more recent research has found that genital hsv1 is even less contagious than previously thought. Here's a fairly recent post about it: https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/kdc6sq/omg_i_just_found_out_my_genital_hsv1_only_sheds_4/

People with genital hsv1 are in a particularly difficult bind in terms of disclosure because if they do disclose, there's a fair chance that the other party will grossly over-estimate the degree of risk. Even if the degree of risk is accurately conveyed to the other party, in many cases the other party will still experience a degree of anxiety far out of proportion to the risk level. (aka irrational anxiety).

Here's a fairly recent example of one woman's experience of this: https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/kp7uoz/ignorance_is_bliss_struggling_with_hypocrisy/

So if a person with genital hsv1 discloses, there's a fair chance the partner will substantially over-react in a negative way. But if the person with genital hsv1 doesn't disclose, and any sort of ongoing sexual and/or romantic relationship develops and the person's status comes out later for any reason, the other partner may consider the lack of prior disclosure to be a severe betrayal of trust -- to the point that it could seriously undermine or even potentially destroy the relationship. Such as occurred here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/l0o98y/why_i_always_disclose/gk1g54b

Here's a direct quote from herpes expert Terri Warren:

>The experts disagree about what to do about the disclosure of genital HSV 1. We know that by two years out after a new infection, the average shedding rate is 4 days per year. And about half the population already has HSV 1.

([Source](https://westoverheights.com/forum/question/i-want-to-understand-more-about-ghsv-1/))

Note that Terrie is saying that by 2 years into a genital hsv1 infection it only sheds 4 days per year on average -- so only 4 days per year where transmission would even be possible. And remember that the vast majority of exposures to asymptomatic shedding *don't* result in transmission, so there's only 4 days per year when there would be any asymptomatic transmission risk at all and the risk would be *low*. Furthermore, about half the population already has hsv1 and so would be at no practical risk from a partner's genital hsv1 infection. They would already have hsv1 antibodies.

So I acknowledge your particular position on this matter but I think the issue is a bit more nuanced than how you're presenting it.",2022-03-28 21:23:21,3
tq4t3v,You can sue someone bc you don't like their shirt.  You're not going to win. Again most people already carry hsv1 and don't know.

tq4t3v,"Whether a person sheds 1 day a year or 100 days a year I still believe that the other person that is engaging in the sexual relationship has a right to consent to that exposure no matter how minuscule it may be. Using condoms and antivirals reduces the spread of herpes but does not eliminate it so informed consent is critical to embarking on a healthy sexual relationship. For some people, hearing that their partner sheds 4 days a year won't be a problem but for others it may be an issue that they do not want to expose themselves too.

 It is not my place to judge a person's personal risk assessment level when it comes to their health so to prevent any issues with crossing someone boundaries I feel it is best to be considerate and disclose to all partners to gain informed consent before furthering things to a sexual level. I will always stand by that belief because a lot of people ended up with an STD due to their partners not being open and honest about their health status.",2022-03-28 22:00:33,1

tq4t3v,"""In some part, the charges for knowingly failing to disclose depend on the STD involved. If the STD is HIV/Aids, a person could be charged with attempted murder. If the STD is herpes, a person could be charged with assault.

In Texas, assault is defined as intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causing bodily harm to another person.  Assault is grounded in an unwanted touching. If a person discloses the condition to a potential partner and the partner knowingly consents, the person with the condition has a defense.
In Texas, assault can either be charged as a misdemeanor or a felony depending on the circumstances. Assault that causes physical harm is most often charged as a Class A misdemeanor which is punishable by up to 1 year in jail and a fine up to $4,000.""


Going through the legal ramifications of possibly being hit with an assault charge or a civil suit because someone didn't disclose their STD are not worth the risk to the damage it can inflict on one's own life and the life of others. Whether the person wins or not isn't the only issue. Having to have one's personal health information exposed through the court system is embarrassing and costly. Being responsible and having an honest conversation to gain consent with sexual partners is key. Disclosure is the right thing to do.

tq4t3v,"I think /u/ooohfuck captured this well.  I personally take issue with the proactive disclosure expectations for all HSV [based on CDC guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/std/herpes/screening.htm#:~:text=CDC%20does%20not%20recommend%20herpes,stopped%20the%20virus%20from%20spreading.).  With that said, for the purposes of this forum, I only active seek to inform and educate about the complexity of HSV-1.

Specifically the CDC states the following for all gHSV infections: 
> There is no evidence that diagnosing genital herpes with a blood test in someone without symptoms would change their sexual behavior and stop the virus from spreading. In addition, without knowing the benefits of testing, the **risk of shaming and stigmatizing people outweighs the potential benefits.** For these reasons, testing everyone for herpes is not recommended at this time.

Additionally, [according to the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/std/herpes/stdfact-herpes-detailed.htm#:~:text=Most%20infected%20persons%20may%20be,never%20received%20a%20clinical%20diagnosis.) 87.4% of people with HSV-2 in particular have never been diagnosed and remain unaware.

So, while I tend to agree with the importance of HSV-2 disclosure, I think it's fair to challenge the stigma associated with it and the individual choice behind this.  The burden that our public health officials put on a tiny tiny tiny portion of those infected with HSV is unfair.  It's the responsibility of those folks engaging in sex to understand the risks they are taking.  And like I said previously, if you've had multiple sexual partners, it's highly improbable that you've not interacted with someone infected.  

I am opposed to the shaming of those with HSV-1 that are confused about disclosure.  While shedding is only 4% after two years, the probability of G-G transmission, even when shedding, is thought to be almost impossible.  Anecdotally, the experts (including Terri) indicate that they've almost never seen it in decades long careers.  

In my opinion, given the prevalence of HSV-1 being at least 45% (and some estimate it to be far greater than that, with challenges in estimating due to the lack of reporting and testing), it's on those that are sexually active to ask.  If I'm asked, as I mentioned before, I will go get tested with someone rather than outing myself.  And as I mentioned, two of the three times I've done that my partner also tested positive.

The point is - this shit is complicated, and I think the oversimplification that occurs here sometimes is really harmful to the mental health of people that come here, and is confusing since it conflicts with the guidance from the majority of health care providers.  [But as evidenced in this paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27582307/) which states ""However, there was a general consensus that disclosure was not required due to the prevalence of HSV and prevalence was used to dissipate emotional reactions to HSV diagnosis."" indicates that I'm not alone in this assessment.",2022-03-29 00:05:22,2

tqls14,"A blood test may or may not give you a clear result. It can take up to 12 weeks from contracting for the antibodies to build up and show on a blood test (a swab test is more accurate). 

Usually once you have hsv1 you cannot get it in another place years later. Some people think they have ohsv1 and got ghsv1 but in actuality they never had ohsv1 and they got canker sores or something else. The other scenario could be you truly have ohsv1 and now have ghsv2. Both would be likelier than having ohsv1 and then contracting ghsv1 years later. From what I understand this would typically only happen in severely immunocompromised people.

Definitely if you get another OB go get it swabbed because it’s going to tell you exactly what that OB is. A blood test would be a good idea 12 week later if you don’t get an OB but blood tests are not reliable and are known for both false positives and false negatives.",2022-03-29 00:16:33,1

tqlp7l,"I have heard this before but I think it is not true. If antibodies are present in the blood it is because your immune system has produced them in response to an infection. No infection, no antibodies. I don't believe it's possible to be ""exposed but not infected"" and develop antibodies. Also I think this is a semantic thing as well - a lot of people use exposure interchangeably with infection. For example a negative person could have unprotected sex with an hsv positive person who is shedding the virus. That person may get lucky and not become infected with the virus, despite the virus coming into contact with their body. In that situation they would have been ""exposed to the virus"" in the sense that their body came into contact with it but for whatever reason it didn't happen to infect them. But that person would not develop antibodies. I suspect there is also confusion around the IgM test (totally useless results) and the high incidence of IgG false positives, which may also be playing a role in this myth.",2022-03-29 00:58:11,4
tqlp7l,I believe they are the same thing since antibodies wouldn’t be present unless you were infected. Antibodies are only needed when you are currently fighting off an infection.,2022-03-29 00:26:21,2
tqlp7l,Very curious about this too,2022-03-28 23:14:29,1
tqlp7l,"Right. I wonder what’s going on there when the person doesn’t get infected. 

To me it seems like it’s just a matter more so of if the person is shedding. More than If the negative person is fighting it off well enough. 

But If that were true we wouldn’t have people here saying they have sex with their partner for years and they don’t get it. At least one of those times per year they had to have had sex while they were shedding. 

I just wonder how much the negative persons bodies response plays a part. And what exactly is going on there. Does the virus enter the person but not stick. Idk.",2022-03-29 04:43:57,1
tqlp7l,"For hsv that may be the case. But with Covid or Spanish flu they stick around for many many years. And reactivate when faced with the virus again. 

I know hsv is in the nerves though. And comes back out when the body is stressed.  

I saw a study recently showing they are still active in some dead bodies too though.",2022-03-29 04:41:17,0
tqlp7l,"No, I do not believe the virus enters the body and doesn't stick. There are plenty of examples of people having sex with a positive person during an outbreak (symptomatic shedding) and having sex when a person is shedding asymptomatically and not getting the virus. It's just luck of the draw if the virus is able to infect the cells. I do not believe there's any ""fighting off"" the virus from the person about to be infected, since their body at this point in time has no antibodies to fight the virus. The virus is a foreign invader and is not recognised by the immune system until infection has already occurred.

You are correct - it has everything to do with shedding. We know this, for example, in looking at people with genital hsv1. This is one of the least contagious forms of herpes. This is because after 2 years, on average a person with genital hsv1 sheds only 4 days in a year. If there is no shedding, there is no risk of transmission. So, therefore the risk of transmission to a negative person in this situation is very, very, very, very low. But the other thing to bear in mind is that having unprotected sex during shedding does not guarantee the negative person will get herpes. So even if a couple has sex on these 4 days a year, it doesn't mean they will for sure transmit. Thus the risk of transmission of ghsv1 is reduced even further. Then you add in condoms and antivirals and you're talking about a less than 1% chance of transmission a year. Personally I just think its about whether the virus can effectively enter the cells it needs to - maybe it came into contact with something that killed it before it entered skin, maybe it just, for whatever reason, couldn't find an opening to get into the cell. For instance, if you have a particularly damaged piece of skin around your genitals when you have sex, the barrier stopping the virus might not be there meaning it's far easier for the virus to enter. This is just my theory - I know for instance in HIV there are something called ""microtears"" which aide the transmission of bloodborne infection, I wonder if its the same thing for hsv on a cellular level?

I don't think this has much to do with the negative recipient's immune system - the only time that plays a part is when infection in the cells has already occurred. I think this is why herpes is much more problematic for immuno compromised individuals - such as AIDS and unborn/new born babies. In those instances herpes can behave differently (for example in neonates you can find HSV in the blood which is extremely rare for a healthy adult, hence why hsv PCR blood tests don't work for most people).",2022-03-29 18:15:24,1

.9-1.09 is maybe. Retest later.

tq6ijv,It’s very very unlikely to transmit GHSV1 through genital intercourse. There haven’t been specific studies done on this because it would take many years and cost a lot of money apparently. They talk about it a bit on here https://youtu.be/YntUMzrvefw,2022-03-28 12:52:11,2

tq6ijv,"You’re welcome, yep it’s a good one, one of the biggest issues about HSV is people who are uneducated about it. Also, I was in a 12 year relationship with my ex-husband who I never transmitted to (majority was unprotected sex) and more recently a 4 month relationship, again without any transmission, no condoms most of the time. I’m not saying go and do it, obviously informed consent is important but you can have a very normal sex life with GHSV1 😊",2022-03-29 03:14:22,2
tq6ijv,"As far as I know it’s pretty low too. If you don’t have any ulcers, GHSV1 sheds rarely, and declines after the first year of transmission. So especially if you’ve had it for 10 years that’s a very low risk. I’ve never transmitted it to anyone through them giving me oral sex either. And I’ve received it a lot 😅 (I’m female, can’t remember if I said that already).",2022-03-29 12:30:27,2

I’ve had gHSV1 for 10 years. I’m assuming it’s okay, must be pretty latent with my antibody buildup based on the video. Plus if one were to add suppression therapy, i don’t see why not.

Honestly you’re fine, you’re not a bad person and you didn’t not tell her out of spite or irresponsibility but because you were scared. 
If you tell explain that to her and say at the time you had sex there was very little risk of transmission she’ll understand and appreciate your honesty. 
The people on here that say ‘you’ve lost her trust’ ‘she won’t want you’ and projecting their own situation and what they have been through.

In 2 years I’ve had 1 outbreak that lasted 1 day. 

We don’t use condoms and I take valacyclovir when I ever feel off. For me I get an achy feeling “down under” and double up on the pills the first day then take one for the following couple days.

tpy3xn,"I understand being afraid of disclosing. I have been diagnosed for 10 years and have had  20+ partners since diagnosis. None of them to their knowledge have genital herpes some had cold sores. I am currently with a guy who is completely HSV negative he works at a blood lab and took a test just for shits and giggles.  He knows about my herpes I disclosed and he is completely fine with it and accepts the risks. There are plenty of people like this who do not care. Sitting around and waiting for a cure it’s silly you’re rejecting yourself before anyone even has a chance to think about it or reject you or accept you. You are putting limits on yourself before giving anyone else the opportunity to consider anything. People get rejected every day for a plethora of different reasons Sure there are people who ghosted me especially on tinder but as I talked to my friends I realized they got ghosted too and it wasn’t because of herpes it was because dating apps are cesspools in general. Dating nowadays sucks for so many reasons if you want to pin it on herpes go for it but that’s not the only reason. I was diagnosed with ghsv-1 at 19 and I thought my life was over I didn’t tell a soul cut off friends and everything because I felt so disgusting and gross. But eventually I put myself out there and had a few positive disclosure s and i began to realize that I was the one creating the stigma for myself.. The more people I told the less it weighted me down. Think of it logically friends should care because it doesn’t effect them. The only people your herpes effects are the people you are sleeping With. Friends are supposed to be your support system and if you tell them your story they should not judge you And they will learn from you And your experience. Hell you May even help a fellow herpes person out becuase if someone discloses to your friend after you teach them about herpes they will be more understanding and knowledgeable about it. But that’s up to you. I’ll attach some links that have seemed to help people and if you need anything please dm me.I’ve had it for almost a decade at this point and have a pretty good handle on it.

This first link is info about a support group I’m in. All herpes people from all over the world we all share are experiences, vent , swap info and remedies, and just talk about life it’s an awesome place to be for sure.

tpsxn3,Have you spoken with your primary care provider? Thus would be a good discussion to have. Your Dr should be familiar with FMLA and the necessary paperwork. The Dr may first want to try some sort if medication to see if it prevents the pain that impairs you during an outbreak.,2022-03-28 02:06:05,1
tpsxn3,"After your first outbreak, the rest shouldn't be that bad. You can use lidocaine ointment (over the counter or prescription strength) and daily antivirals to help prevent and treat them.

tpy968,I started taking an anti anxiety pill. Zoloft. It has completely helped. Also found anti virals to be amazing. I take 1 to 2 when I’m feeling the nerve pain. (Valtrex),2022-03-28 14:13:54,2

After which you can drop the antiviral and continue on lysine.

tq3qzd,Post to profile or as a link,2022-03-28 07:27:56,1
tq3qzd,That looks and sounds exactly like herpes with 95% certainty. You need to go to the doctor while they're as active and irritated as they are so they can swab them for an accurate test. That will tell you if they're 1 or 2 and the doctor can prescribe antivirals to clear up your current outbreak and hopefully keep future outbreaks at bay.,2022-03-28 14:38:01,1

I sometimes forget to take my daily meds but I do take it pretty regularly but not every day. Do you think I could have passed it on to my fiancé? I’ll just say our relationship would be over immediately if so. I’m praying that I haven’t. It’s now day 3 and I’m on edge praying that I didn’t pass it on to him. What’s the chances that I may have?

tpncxv,"I know it’s hard to face this feeling, but with all due respect, you are putting this man on a pedestal. You’ve only known him for a few weeks, how can you know he’s your soul mate?

Yes, you clicked very well, but the more people you date, the more you’ll realize that this feeling is actually not that rare. Uncommon? Maybe. But not so rare that this will be the last person to ever make you feel this way. 

I’ve dated very regularly in the past, going on several first dates in one week was a common thing for me for a number of years, so maybe we just have different lived experiences. 

But consider that this person could have any number of negative traits, habits, secrets that you don’t yet know about. Maybe it’s *you* who’s dodged a bullet and you just don’t know it yet. Fast forward a few months and maybe you’ll see his mug shot on your news feed. You just never know, so it’s best not to assume extreme positives or negatives about what could’ve been.

Maybe you feel like he’s your soul mate, but you shouldn’t assume that he feels the same way just because everything was going smoothly before disclosure. And do you want to be with someone who doesn’t reciprocate that feeling?

I guarantee that if you meet one new person a week for the next year, you’re bound to run into one, or several, more people who make you feel this way.",2022-03-27 21:25:37,7
tpncxv,"It sucks, it really does. But what I would tell myself would be that if they are turned off by it or can’t accept it, then they are not my soulmate - because my soulmate would accept every part of me, as I would do with him. 
I don’t understand throwing your soulmate away because of something so minor. Especially when the next person might as well could have it - I mean, good luck finding someone who hasn’t been in contact with or doesn’t already have herpes ? When you know the statistics it seems so stupid … 

But again. He is not your soulmate if he cannot accept every part of you and love you regardless of your “flaws”. I know it fucking sucks. Mourn it, cry, scream and dwell in it, but remember to come back to life again ❤️

tpncxv,"I am older than all of you and I've heard many a story of others having herpes and being rejected for it so early in possible relationships that were being rushed to sex.  Now I have HSV-2 from someone afraid to be honest about their test result fearing rejection.  I personally would get to know a romantic interest as a true friend that I was considering as a potential marriage mate and confirm they were doing the same before asking them to make a date to get a STD panel including for Herpes and HIV.  This would also weed out the players/users and lessen broken hearts.   This process could take many months. There is no rush to be sexual.  Build something based on respect and admiration vs wanting a hot body or worst because they're horny and you're nearest in proximity.  Then share your written test results with the other - never take their word for it.  People form emotional attachments (roots) and grow together when they share intimate experiences i.e. their health results.  They need to be invested in your happiness over their own.  If only you come back positive, well now you have a protective friend that truly cares about you and will help you research Herpes and find out its really not that big and scary as they thought.  The hookup culture treats people like shiny objects to be used and tossed aside - they just want the cookie without any time invested or  work.  (Masturbation is highly underrated.)  It's now up to us to educate others and lead them to be tested.  The medical community sure isn't going to do it.",2022-03-27 23:25:04,4
tpncxv,"Awh, big hugs. Sadly, if it's the first time someone is confronted with that situation and they don't know much about herpes, it's not too surprising especially if they're in their mid-twenties.

A couple of years ago I went on a few dates with a girl who kindly informed that she had herpes. At the time, I didn't know anything about it other than that it's incurable. I didn't see her as a life partner and decided to put an end to things delicately.

If I did think that she was a potential life partner, it would've been a tougher decision but I can't say with certainty what I'd have done - what if things hadn't worked out? I simply didn't know much about herpes at all at the time.

Now... I have herpes, woohoo! Obviously I know a lot more about it now because of this, and I understand that it's honestly not a big deal (I've only recently got it, but will of course tell all future partners about it).

What I will say is that if I knew what I know now about herpes, but didn't have it, then I wouldn't hesitate to pursue a relationship with someone who is positive, if I thought there was a chance of it working out.

So there's hope! I'm a different person now, approaching my thirties, which plays a big part. So you'll find your right person, they might just be a little older than this guy :)",2022-03-27 20:25:28,3

If preferred there are many precautions you can take to make your sex life wonderful with little to no risk.

tpncxv,"I don’t get people when I read things like this. So many people walk around with one and two and they don’t know they have it and they give it to other people, but yet people are unwilling to give people a chance that are honest about it and in most cases take medication and proper precautions to prevent spreading! Like this can happen to anybody ,we all have sex! It’s not that big of a deal! I’m sorry you have to deal with this! People need to educate themselves and stop being so shallow. You’re probably better off",2022-03-27 19:24:13,6

tpncxv,"I left my soulmate because of her herpes, and it was the hardest decision of my life.  Since we are both young(ish), my thoughts kept landing on the fact that if we broke up she is still an insanely desirable woman with a million options, but I would become a social pariah.  The stigma is not divided evenly.  Men pursue and women choose.  If you’re a sexy woman with herpes, the dating world is still your sandbox, only a tiny bit smaller.  I couldn’t risk that she wasn’t going to change her mind about me at some future date.  Maybe propose abstinence before marriage if you truly feel like you are losing your soulmate.  If I could have a do-over, I would float that idea to my lost love.  She wouldn’t have gone for it, but at least I wouldn’t have been the “bad guy” for ruining something because of her “minor skin condition.” And if she went for it and we married? Then we could have lived without ever mentioning the H-word again.

And I agree about finding someone who’s older . It’s interesting you say that because the ones that have been totally ok with it have all been my age or older. So I think it’s definitely something you learn along the way and the more you’re exposed to it , the more you realize how not a big deal it is . Thank you:)",2022-03-27 20:51:51,2

You were about to fuck me with no protection? And now you’re uncomfortable about the fact that I have herpes ? Ooof! The rationale just isn’t there for me",2022-03-27 19:48:53,8

He told me multiple times that I am everything he’s looking for in a partner. Although that could just be words , I do believe it as it played out in his actions as well. He is definitely not what you would expect a “normal” single 26 year old male to be like . .

I am going to encourage the blood test. I completely agree with you. He has likely been exposed and doesn’t know. I just hate the stigma and negative talk about it. Sure, nobody wants it but it’s not the end of the world .",2022-03-27 17:09:11,3

Fortunately yes I do not have any issues usually. I disclose , nobody cares, we do the thing or date or whatever and we don’t ever talk about it. But I think of those that I’ve been intimate with with no protection who then move onto someone else. Do they tell their new partner that they fucked someone with herpes and no protection?? HIGHLY doubt it . But I’m the bad guy for having gotten tested and knowing I have it. 

It’s all just fucked. I’m sorry you are still missing her and thinking about her. But It’s not necessarily a never ever again. Life is weird. Strange things happen. Keep your head up.",2022-03-27 19:53:28,3

My honest opinion is that if you’re ready to have sex without condoms and any talks about sti’s, then you’re almost agreeing to getting one. It shouldn’t be on our shoulders and it shouldn’t change anything 🙄
But as you’ve mentioned in your other comments, I think it’s because it’s the first time he’s met someone with herpes and has experienced someone being honest. He will most likely be getting it in the future and regret he missed out on you.",2022-03-27 20:26:20,3

tpodcp,"I hope I can shed some light for you. I was with my ex for 2 years, I didn’t leave him because I was scared I wouldn’t be able to find anyone else that would want to be with me. It was an abusive relationship so I made the decision to break up with him. Since then I’ve been with a few people and yeah, it was hard to disclose. But what I did is I practiced what I wanted to say, I looked up facts about it good and bad. I wanted to make sure the person I was going to be with could feel comfortable because if I were in their shoes, I’d definitely want to know facts. What helped me the most was just staying cool about the situation and even though when it’s time to tell them you’re super nervous, just keep your cool and stay calm. Never apologize either, it wasn’t your fault. I’ve found out though that a lot of people are more accepting than you think. Every sexual interaction I’ve had since then has worked out when I disclose. I always let them know they can ask me any questions without me taking offense. Knowing your facts about it though is definitely something that helps people understand more. A lot of people see this big stigma about HSV so it makes them uncomfortable, when in reality it’s not that big of a deal as people make it to be. If I were in your situation and I wasn’t happy I think I would leave, focus on loving yourself and being comfortable with the fact that you have it (I know it may seem hard). I was devastated at first, and then I learned so much about it and connected with other people that had it. It made me feel so much better. The more comfortable you are with yourself, the easier it will be to disclose to people :). HSV doesn’t ruin your future or your sex life, don’t let anyone tell you different. Wish you well😽",2022-03-27 21:23:46,8

If you could figure out the triggers it'd be easier to deal with them. If it is food taking supplemental lysine could help or changing diet yes. Alcohol speaks for itself. If it is sex then try more lube as it reduces friction which is what usually causes it. 

If it it stress then a bit harder to deal as well as periods. There are proven ways to reduce stress and those could be googled. 

For periods - going on daily birth control could help or antivirals. If valacyclovir doesn't help you could try acyclovir as some people find one works better than other for them.

Is there a chance you passed it? Yes. There’s always a *chance* but having sex with someone doesn’t guarantee transmission, especially if it was protected. 

I know it’s stressful, but you’re overthinking it. This is probably because you waited two years to start dating again so this feeling is new and overwhelming. If you had started dating again a year and a half ago, you’d be used to this feeling, likely not have passed to anyone if you were responsible, and it wouldn’t be so scary.

The first outbreak is always the worst and you will improve each time. 1 in 2 people have herpes; 1 in 4 have genital herpes. You are far from alone in this. Many people go decades without an outbreak after that first outbreak/year. The first year of acceptance and initial outbreaks will be the hardest, but it gets immensely better over time. So much so that once you are past the initial period you will come to realize it's not a big deal at all, it's just been so stigmatized that we are initially shocked into terror.

I’d wait until your outbreak has finished and the you’ll be fine having sex again!
Sorry you’re outbreak is painful, the cream and the pills should really help so well done for being proactive!

I’m 23 now and I also have GHSV1, and I’ve never transmitted it to a single one of my sexual partners. 

Also, in the meantime, try peeing in the shower with the water on, or get one of those water bottles that you can squeeze to squirt out and pour it over the area. Makes it a lot easier. Loose-fitting clothing will also help.

It’s a personal choice. 

People all over this sub will kiss without disclosure but claim disclosure below the waist is necessary. A lot of people here are hurting.  I don’t blame them. 

HSV-1 should be presumed with every sexual partner absent a negative test, because the reality is most of your partners will have it. 

Unless the CDC changes its guidance away from blissful ignorance, I very much struggle with the emotional burden society puts on a select few, despite the clear reality that the majority of people have this virus.",2022-03-28 04:13:27,3

I've had a partner with cold sores and thought no big deal of it, but didn't know it was contagious. Upon hearing my diagnosis, I was shocked and went on the internet and realized people were having strong debates about disclosing, which had me second guessing. 

I think your point about presuming every sexual partner has HSV-1 is a very solid point, especially once I found out that a significant amount of the population has this virus. I also completely agree with the unfairness of the blissful ignorance that many people get to enjoy as they simply just do not know their status since it's not widely tested, in contrast with the few who end up finding out their status and struggle with disclosing or not.",2022-03-28 19:18:01,1

So lets assume I've had 30 partners, you would assume that at least 10, but likely 20, if not more, had HSV - and only 1 disclosed.

I don't assume disclosure.  If I want to know, I ask.  I can choose on my own whether I want to see the results.  If I really like the person, and they ask, I'll just say ""That's a great question, why don't we go get tested together.""  Then boom, if they test positive, it makes the entire conversation a lot easier.  (This has happened two of the three times I've gone down that path),

If you want casual sex, you can still have it. All you have to say is, ""Hey I have herpes type 2. I take daily medication to help reduce the risk, and because we will be using condoms, and I'm not having an outbreak, the risk is really low. Your call, no hard feelings.""

It works for a lot of people, of all genders. Don't get pissy if someone declines, that's their right.

tp8is7,"Hey dude, I’m going to relay some words to you from my perspective but please take these, not as an insult, but rather as support and encouragement (tough love type shit - cause I understand bro). I know your feelings all too well and it hurts me to see others like this because I was once in that position (Currently still kind of am to be honest). Your life isn’t ruined by herpes. It’s how you’re handling your diagnosis that’s “ruining” your life. You’re probably in that period where you just discovered you have herpes and now you feel like an outcast especially with society viewing people with herpes as “tainted” or “dirty” - to which I say, I understand. Have your moments of sadness and grief and find some solutions to help you return back to normalcy, but to let something like herpes make you feel like your life is over and you have nothing else to live for? Come on bro, stop being a pussy. I didn’t even get herpes from any sexual encounter. I just got cold sores one day and found out that I had herpes from who the fuck knows where. Also, I’ve never had any sexual or love experience with any females in my life. I’m 25M, fat, and balding (well bald now because I bit the bullet and shaved it all off) so I know for a fact that I probably won’t be getting any females soon especially now that I have herpes added onto my plate. At first I was so furious. This anger was beyond “regular” anger because I didn't do anything to get this - I was just living my day to day. Life just said ""fuck you, here's herpes"". Herpes just showed up in my life and I didn’t know even know how. So now I’m stuck with the fact that I already have no love life (or social even), young and already bald, (being fat can be changed but it doesn’t help), and now HERPES??? Fuck my life right? Well, yes and no. Yes being the fact that you can’t not admit that my situation sucks and I know that, I understand it, and I even embrace it, but also no. No at the fact that my life is still worth living and enjoying. I’m still living. I have shelter, food, water, a decent paying job, and good friends and family. There are others in worse positions with more harmful diseases, physical or mental damage, etc. Now, please note that I am not trying to make this a competition nor do I know how your life has been so I am not trying to make any points based on that. However, the point I am trying to make is that life fucking sucks, but we ourselves have the choice to determine if it will keep sucking on our own accord or do something about it to make it better. We all have problems whether we are rich, poor, dumb, smart, beautiful, ugly, etc. You have your issues + herpes, I have my issues + herpes. However, to establish that your whole life is ruined because you now have some benign skin condition that society deems as “disgusting” is just down right ridiculous. You’re essentially putting your whole worth, your WHOLE POTENTIAL even (because you still have years ahead of you to become a better version of yourself) on the fact that you have some skin condition. You’re better than that bro and I know so because you’re worth more than just a herpes diagnosis - which I should remind you, about 80%+ of the world has (with or without knowing). So what I’m trying to get at is, you can be sad, angry, or suicidal even (don’t be suicidal though you have much to live for) about your herpes (I know I have), but at the end of the day, your life is what you make it. Do you want to live the rest of your life with the fact of having herpes is affecting your lifestyle, choices, opportunities, etc? Or do you want to accept it (because that’s the only real way of getting past it) and  determine the quality of your life through the actions you make, the mindset you have, and the opportunities you conquer instead? I have had so many things go wrong in my life and the stuff that I just mentioned about me are just the tip of the iceberg. I’ve hit rock bottom many times and especially with my recent diagnosis of herpes, I felt like I have reached a new level. However, I realized that I still have years ahead of me which I can choose two ways of approaching it. One: remain rock bottom and have all the negative things in my life weigh me down and affect my mindset, thus forcing me to live life with an existential dread and never climb out of the hole I dug myself and am currently digging deeper because of the mindset I have - “surviving” until I am dead. Or two: accept the things that have happened to me that can’t be fixed (whether or not it’s my fault) and look ahead - look at the possible choices or opportunities I can take on in the future to improve my life and myself. To not let my negative experiences control my way of living and thinking. To allow myself to be motivated to make more out of my current situation and me as a person. Because when I’m at my death bed, I’m not going to be thinking about how herpes or balding made my life go to shit and how I lived a shit life because of that. I’m going to be thinking about regretting at all the stuff I could have accomplished, relationships I could have formed, or who I could have become - if I wasn’t so torn apart by the all the shit life decided to give me which made me live in mediocrity. So bottom line is, you can feel like shit about the herpes diagnosis - have your time and moment to grief (I took a week off of work to process my diagnosis). However, once you accept this fact, move on and start thinking about how you can take this shitty hand that life dealt you, and personally turn it around through your actions to make your life and yourself better. Do you want to be the guy who had herpes that hated himself? Or do you want to be someone that has accomplished something (or many things) in their lives (big or small) and enjoyed every last second of it to its fullest with no regrets… aaaaand who happens to have herpes which 80%+ of the world has. Your call man. Keep your head up king 👑. You’re being blinded from your true potential because of a skin condition. Life moves on and so should you.

(Also I know herpes may be more than just a skin condition, but point still stands)

tp8is7,I’m so sorry. I do believe there is light at the end of the tunnel. I do understand what you’re saying. If you’re a decent person you tell your potential partner upfront before anything happens and I’d imagine it ruins a lot of potential relationships. I honestly don’t know what to say to make this better other than the outbreaks should get better with time. Maybe you find a partner who is also positive so this is not an issue for you both.

One thing. Society perspective on herpes is a very scary one. Its literally like a scary story your parents tell you.   Before getting educated i. Was scared and basically thought my life was over. But you only think that way not because u believe it as a proven facts but because society tells us that before you get infected 

Herpes is very common especially hsv1, majority people like u said have it and dont know, they unintentionally pass it on( think about the amount of people that is how much people they infect(which is a negative term imo) then there are the peoole who dont care.  At that point its basically a battle of time against the inevitable.   

If u ask for a full sti test. They never outright include herpes.  I think its because majority of people will have it and not have symptoms.   And even if they do they prolly mistake it for something else.  The ones who do have the obvious symptoms have no choice but to get checked out

Basically everyone eventually will get some form of herpes.  Accepting is hard and letting go of the person u saw before is hard. But truly accepting is knowing that this doesnt change you in anyway. The thing tjat changes is how u see your self from your perspective and the world.  Be confident once you learned to love the you that alreayd great.  Youll be able to connect and have a aocial life like u want.   But u have to be confident in ya self.   Its sucks i get but one saying that i came up with [trademarked]😂

tp8is7,"""I am sick of pretending herpes does not ruin YOUR life"",  not mine :)

Presumably you are in your early days of diagnosis? It can take a long, long time to accept this condition- it took me years.

Whilst you are perfectly within your rights to be angry and upset, in time you need to ask yourself who does this serve?

As someone who has had hsv for over 10 years, basically my entire adult life (and a male), I can tell you your sex life is most definitely not over. Nor do you need to worry about how you're going to infect ""the only one that accepts you"" (bs btw).

With antivirals and condoms you are extremely unlikely to pass the virus on. If you happen to have hsv1 then it's even less of a concern given that such a huge percentage of the population already have it. The fact you are asymptomatic means you are way less likely to shed. For hsv2 it's basically halved.

Is it unfair that you feel a burden that you have to disclose whilst others live in blissful ignorance? Yes. Life is unfair, get used to it. There are far worse conditions/diseases/illnesses you could have right now which would blow hsv out of the water.

You will get through this, but it will take time. I strongly suggest you seek out counselling/therapy as your post reads as though you are struggling.

The vast majority of people with hsv do not kill themselves, do not live lives of celibacy; they live meaningful, healthy, happy lives. Do not self sabotage.",2022-03-27 05:36:19,1

tp8is7,"It’s not the end of the world at all my dude. I have 3 family friends who all have herpes that I found out about after my diagnosis. All three of which have had it longer than 15 years ( 1 has had it for ~15, another has had it for over 23 years and another has had it for 30+ years. The 30 and 23 are in happy married relationships with someone who has not contracted HSV from them. They get tested frequently and most likely due to the daily suppressant that they take it highly reduces viral shedding and obviously they just don’t have sex during an outbreak. The one who’s had it for 15 years is currently in a relationship with a boyfriend for 3 years now, she has unprotected sex all the time with him and in fact she hasn’t had an outbreak for over 6 years. The other two get maybe one outbreak a year IF that. It’s manageable, just tough at the start. I was in the same situation as you felt like my world was crashing down on me but I spent countless hours doing research, watching stigma and informational videos on youtube, started going to the gym this week which honestly has GREATLY increased my mental health, watch my arginine intake and eat things that are high in Lysine. If you’re having suicidal thoughts please please please go speak with a therapist. 

Yes, this sucks for us all. It’s scary and a major shock when you first get it. But everything will be alright down the line. I hope you find peace in your diagnosis.

When you can easily hookup with a woman, it can give off the impression the woman is easy, and guys may be deterred from wanting something serious with a woman they can get with right off the bat. Best to get to know the person well and establish a connection over time, especially if you have hsv, before becoming intimate. Let them really get to know you before you drop the news and they decide the risk isn't worth it.",2022-03-27 01:40:14,-5

It should be, ""Hey let's talk about safer sex. I have herpes type 2 (or whatever type you have, and if you don't know, find out), and I take valtrex daily (if you do), and I'm happy to answer any questions you have about it. Have you been tested for it? What about you? What should I know?""

tp8is7,"I hear your pain, brother. I'm 40 and got it in college, so I've been dealing w it for awhile. 

This is my advice: suppressive valtrex everyday. I know it sucks, but it is the best thing that you can be doing for yourself mentally and the best way to protect your partners. Without any symptoms and while on suppression, your ability to spread it is negligible (even less if you use a condom). Essentially, the drug makes you the safest bet out there bc you're doing something proactively and scientifically proven to bring the risk of transmission as low as possible. Be thankful that there is valtrex as it was only released in 1996 and came off patent only a few years ago. It was very expensive before it came off. 

If it helps too, girls are more susceptible to it and are the majority of the carriers, so they have to be extra vigilant and should appreciate what you are doing.",2022-03-27 01:49:05,2

tp8is7,"I have type 1 in both places. Like most people, I've never had a talk about safer sex and just use condoms until things get girlfriend-y. It's mostly about not being able to have spontaneous physicality anymore. My asymptomatic mouth is as potentially poisonous as my genitalia, so, if I'm being rigorous, I can't even go in for a kiss without announcing that I'm an [extremely trivial] health liability. I guess I could do it before meeting, but the ensuing extra cost/benefit scrutiny would probably take me out of the running, especially because I'm 0% available for or interested in anything serious.

tp8is7,"Poisonous? I don't know if you're joking or not, but your language matters. If this is what you are telling yourself, it's no wonder you feel this way. 

Do you get oral symptoms? Is that how you know you have it in both places? 

Are you educated about ohsv1 and ghsv1? Your ohsv1 is actually more infectious than your genital hsv1. 

[These are average shedding rates](https://westoverheights.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Updated-Herpes-Book.pdf):

HSV 2 genital 15-30% of days evaluated  
HSV 1 genital 3-5% of days evaluated   
HSV 1 oral 25% of days evaluated  
HSV 2 oral 1% of days evaluated 

It will vary depending on how many outbreaks you get, how long you've had it. We know now that if you've had ghsv1 longer than 2 years, you are shedding about 4 days a year outside of outbreaks. You can take daily antivirals to reduce this, generally by half. 

We don't have transmission data for hsv1 like we do for hsv2. 

67% of people under 50 globally have hsv1 already. If they already have it, you can't re-infect them. Just talk to them. Have them test if it's going to be a long-term thing. 

If it's one night thing, then just say what I said above, and change it to hsv1. I mean, how do you even know they don't have HPV or syphilis or something if you aren't talking? Condoms don't fully protect against those, either. Maybe most people aren't talking, but they should be.",2022-03-28 06:51:18,1

I could even write an honest presentation slanted toward minimizing perceived risk, if that was my style (it isn't). I just can't imagine any of them selling when all I can offer is dinner and drinks every now and then (I'm in a career-building phase of life and work 7 days a week). I've never gotten a second outbreak. I've always gone down on women and don't really want to stop, so oral vs genital infectiousness is kind of moot.

I'm not saying it's ever easy.  I danced around not disclosing because I couldn't handle the conversation.  I thought about never dating again.  It's only been 4 months and I've come around to just telling people. 

I think its easier once you get a feel for how to tell someone  if you genuinely don't think it's a big deal, it will come out like it's not a big deal. If you think it's life ending  well then you'll tell them as if you're shameful. 

Again  I'm not saying it's easy. You'll be rejected sometimes and sometimes you won't. 

Worst case, there are dating apps for positive people 🤷🏻‍♀️ 

We're all in this together. I dont mean to be a positive rainbows and sunshine freak  I mean it genuinely lol  you're not the only one with this experience  itll be hard and it'll be easy  you just have to navigate the field",2022-03-27 14:10:32,7

tp92t3,"Depends.  
I always take meds if I'm sexually active. I don't disclose it when I'm wearing condoms. Oral is a toss-up. 

(NOW I WILL TELL YOU WHY)

For about a decade now I have been getting tested at least once a year for all stds. 

(OR SO I THOUGHT).....

Every year up until last year I tested clean. 

So last year once I tested positive, I did research. 

It turns out when you walk into a doctor's office and request to be tested for all STDs...
they DO NOT test you for herpes unless you specifically say you want to be tested for herpes or you have an outbreak.

This is following government guidelines.

What researchers found was that even when people would get a positive diagnosis it would not change their habits one bit. 

And since the disease will not hurt you or kill you or take any years off your life it's not a top priority. 

The only reason I know I have it is because I hooked up with a very skanky girl and wanted to be tested and mentioned all of the diseases I wanted to be tested for. 

So that is why most people in society have it and they will never know about it.

So if I never specified, I would never know, and anyone I hooked up with would never know, so there's no burden on me to disclose. 

And in the weird hookup culture we have now we can all be spreading it just from kissing and still not know.

So don't beat yourself up about it. 

If you only sleep with people that you mutually decide to test ahead of time with then you probably should disclose. 

The truth is every person over age 12 in this country got tested you would probably have a 70 to 85% positivity rate. 

Plenty of people get it from their parents from being kissed. 

Abstain if you have an outbreak and go on meds if you're sexually active.

But other than that don't let it stress you out. 

I still can't figure out how I got it or where. I could have had it for the last 20 years.",2022-03-28 19:42:17,1

It’s really hard, I know it is. 
And you feel like you can’t tell anyone? Feel ashamed? 

I was diagnosed only a couple weeks ago, and I feel terrible. But the first thing you have to do is tell someone. Anyone. 
I couldn’t bare to tell anyone I knew so I called a helpline, I didn’t know what else to do. They helped. They help me organise my thoughts a bit. 

Eventually I told an online friend, I was worried he wouldn’t want to be my friend anymore. But he still did. He accepted me, when I didn’t. 

I ended up talking to the nurse at uni and then the doctor at uni. It helps talking to people, they can give you a different perspective, I promise. 
They’ll explain things differently, help you see that it isn’t a reflection of you.

I told the guy I was talking to as well (started talking to him right before diagnosis) and he did his research, but he’s still talking to me. He accepts me more than I accept me. 

This virus doesn’t define you, it doesn’t mean anything about you. It is just bad luck, literally really fucking bad luck.

tpe1q2,"Hsv blisters don’t have white stuff coming out , they are clear fluid / or yellowish tinged clear fluid. 

Your ex or her mom is lying to her as cold sores are hsv. 

And getting sti tested only annually if you have multiple partners is likely not enough .  Standard tests rarely include hsv. The tests are not 100 % accurate so even if you are showing up negative on igg hsv1 ( especially )it has a 30% false negative rate, even if you leave the 12 weeks between partners to test. With about 70 % of us having hsv1 and a lot are all asymptomatic and either not being tested or the test is giving false negs it’s almost impossible to avoid hsv1 if you are involved in a poly life style. 

I think with regards to your bump or pimple it probably wasn’t hsv but that doesn’t mean you don’t have it or won’t get it. If you have a sore / lesion / blister get it swabbed 24-48 hr from when it appears , preferably pcr.

I also understand not every place is set up for hsv testing (which i find silly because of how common this seems) and sometimes nothing to swab. I have 1 nurse that thinks i need anxiety meds and others that say better to be safe about it. 

Besides this i have backed down from partners and setting for an appointment to get tested but timing seems to important as the spot has changed already. (Due to covid, my ex and the vaccines i have turned away from that lifestyle to work on myself)

I’m honestly hoping to find a long time partner with hsv1 then so we can have sex- oral and otherwise- unprotected and not worry about antivirals, etc. If my HSV2 is negative, it might depend on if I would choose to partner with someone hsv2 positive- and it wouldn’t necessarily have to do with the virus, it would have to do with how long and serious the relationship could/would potentially be.

tpc17y,The test should definitely have specified type 1 or 2.  What did it say?,2022-03-28 18:54:30,1
tpc17y,"3.5 HSV1, 1.17 HSV2",2022-03-28 18:55:57,1
tpc17y,"Okay so this result means you’ve had type 1 long term already.  Welcome to the club.  70% of the population.  No biggie.  

As for HSV2 the chances of this being a false positive are huge.  Especially if you don’t have symptoms. 

The closer you get to 1.0 the greater the chance of false positive.  Like 1.1 to 1.9 range.  Most people test positive at 3, 5, 10, 20.  

At 1.17 you’re looking at 90% chance this isn’t really positive.  

So breathe a sigh of relief.  

Now, if you want confirmation, simply wait until 30 days from your first blood draw and run it again. You can see if that HSV2 igg number is rising at all.  

Then test again at 12 weeks.  If you’re still hovering around 1.2 then you probably don’t have genital herpes.  

If at that point you want to be 10,000% sure, order a western blot test.  This will confirm yes or no.  

On its own, a 1.17 is most likely a false positive.  But you also tested SUPER early.  So tracking it every 30 days can give you some peace of mind while you wait for the 12 week test.

tpc17y,"Thank you, this gives me peace of mind. Just to note, the potential ""exposure"" would've happened on Jan 1st, roughly 2.5 months before the 1.17 score came in. I'm confident that my current girlfriend doesn't have herpes (or at least didn't give me it), so if I do have it, it would've come from this other girl I had sex with on new years (before we were dating).

Also, I was really drunk and totally botched the sex. I rubbed around looking for the hole but didn't make it in and she told me to stop (lol). So if I somehow contracted herpes THEN, jesus that's bad luck.  


In the past 5 days or so, a couple of lumps appeared on my shaft. This looks nothing like the images of herpes I can find online, but maybe someone could tell me if this looks similar to what they had.

The two lumps on the sides are my concern. The red blemishes and scab on the base are from the cluster of pimples I was referring to in my original post. The scab is bc I picked at one.

I don't know if this is an outbreak or what. There has been no pain at all, no oozy fluids besides the pimple I popped (which was white and chunky). The lumps will tingle a little bit when I walk around but I wouldn't say it's ""itchy"". Let me know if this relates to anyone's herpes experience. Do first outbreaks even happen \~3 months after exposure?

tp9irv,HSV1 is super common. Chances are she already had hsv1 before being with you. You guys should get tested via blood work. IGG hsv1 and hsv2.,2022-03-27 02:48:30,1
tp9irv,"> Would hsv cause cold symptoms for 4 days with no OB? 

>Update: he says he has a sore throat, congestion and headache but did not say if he had a fever. Does this indicate hsv?

When it is said that herpes can cause flu-like symptoms, this is referring to symptoms similar to those of *influenza* (ie the *flu*) ie headache, fever, general body aches all over (not highly focused in and limited to a very specific area), light sensitivity, and swollen lymph nodes near the region of infection but not elsewhere (eg in the groin for genital infections, or in the head/neck for oral infections). Herpes would *not* cause symptoms of a cold, ie stuffy nose, runny nose, sore throat, cough, congestion, sinus issues, etc. (Oral herpes *could* cause a sore throat if it were to cause actual lesions in the throat itself, but that is very rare.)

Furthermore, the only circumstance in which herpes has the potential cause flu-like symptoms is from from a brand new infection that occurred within 2-10 days prior, and such symptoms would only occur if the person was experiencing at least moderate-to-extensive visible blisters/lesions as well, that would appear within a day or two of the flu-like symptoms, if not sooner.

So no, your partner's symptoms are not at all suggestive of herpes, in numerous respects.",2022-03-27 04:05:35,1

When tested a month later, I was HSV2+ and had a HSV1+ result below 2.0 IGG range.  This indicated positive.  The false positive range for HSV1 is .91 - 3.5.  That doesn't mean that it is definitely false positive, but if you've never experienced an outbreak, then you're either asymptomatic or it's false positive.   The WB is only 70% accurate toward HSV1 determinations... so I'd say wait until 12 weeks after your last exposure to HSV2 and take the Western Blot (WB) to check for both.  MY HSV1 was negative on my WB, and also dropped to <.90 since receiving the 1.85 IGG range.  Also, never experienced symptoms of HSV1.  Hope this helps.",2022-03-28 01:07:22,1

For me, if I was told before sexual contact, that would go far to building trust. If the person was on daily suppressive, we discussed precautions and agreed in advance, barriers and avoiding contact with location in question when suspicious OB starting, And there was initial building of emotional intimacy, I would proceed with physical intimacy, sure thing",2022-03-25 18:00:52,19
tntdf1,"I have HSV2 genitally. Supposedly the “worse” type of the two. You can get either kind either place. 

I wish I would’ve known that I could still catch herpes with a condom on. But looking back at how I was living, I’m honestly surprised that I didn’t catch it earlier (I was 25 when I caught it). 

After living with it for almost two years, 90+% of days I forget I have it. I only had initially symptoms for 7 days or so. Haven’t felt or seen anything since those first symptoms subsided almost 2 years ago. 

It was brave of her to tell you considering that most people with herpes either don’t know they have it or don’t feel the need to tell new partners because it effects them (the carriers) so little after a certain point and the chances of transmission are so low. You might already have herpes yourself, or at least already had sex with someone who has it, without even knowing. 

No regrets when my ex gave me herpes. Did I want it? No, but I don’t resent her for giving it to me. There is so much grey area on the matter that this sun overlooks. The initial shock is jarring, but strep throat was worse than herpes for me in my opinion.",2022-03-25 22:24:13,11

The person I contracted it from didn't know they had it and didn't regularly get STD screened despite hooking up and not using protection with people prior to me (not that they test for HSV in a typical panel), and because we were in a monogamous relationship, I justified not using protection, which I should have done. 

It's not the end of the world, but it does put an obstacle in your life that you can avoid if you're careful and vet the people you become romantic with. Just understand that there is a risk of you contracting it if you become intimate with her. It's not guaranteed, but the risk is always there, and once you have it, it's with you for life.",2022-03-25 21:14:01,2

If you restrict yourself to dating people that don’t have HSV1, you are drastically reducing your dating pool.

HSV1 is only contagious a few days of the year and protection will cut it down to next to impossible that you contract it if you don’t already have it. Not impossible, but honestly less than a percent I believe.",2022-03-25 21:52:09,2

I don’t know if there’s science behind this but I honestly think the showering after sex is key… hopefully it washes away any potential virus before it has a chance to stay? In your case, if she has hsv1 chances are even lower for you catching it.

I've been going to this doctor for about 10 years. I say ""wait haven't I been tested before? "" he says not for herpes. So all these years I thought I was negative for herpes I never was tested! So I convince him to order the test. And I do have HSV1. I feel terrible that I even considered maybe not sleeping with a guy that literally has the same virus I do.

There is antivirals you can take to reduce chances of transferring it to your partner and to reduce the amount of breakouts. I don't take them regularly because I don't have many breakouts and my partner isn't worried about it.

I didnt know the guy I had sex with had it. He didn't tell me and I don't know if he knew I have type 2. It hasn't really impacted me that much most of the time I don't even remember it. I've had maybe 3 break outs in the 2 years I've had it. I already had a partner when I got it (threesome). He didn't really care we still had unprotected sex and never even thought about it he never got tested in the 3 years we were together so I don't know if he has it.

B) I don’t know when or who I got it from. So I can’t really turn back the clock. I guess I would be less judge mental about other people having it (stigma) and maybe required more testing. Honestly I don’t think I would have done so much differently.",2022-03-26 09:06:29,1

You do not know how hard it is for men to get any form of intimacy when you have hsv from the opposite sex after disclosing. Women also have it difficult when wanting a relationship/marriage but they can still have sex with the opposite sex and that's a level of intimacy men will struggle with. Most men won't leave the talking stage.

 What she's saying about previous men having unprotected intercourse for x years and no one caught anything can be true or false. There's no proof of that.  Men lie women lie. People who don't use foresight will always use hindsight. Use foresight. There's one thing if she has it and didn't tell you and you contracted it but if she told you and you still went along any way and then contracted it you have no one to blame but yourself. 

If you're a man and you don't have hsv only date someone with it if you're going to marry them. And have sex only after marriage. That's just my 2 cents",2022-03-26 14:37:12,0

toiibc,">he really doesn’t want to get herpes

He already has herpes, just not the strain you have. Don't let that comment go without challenging it. 

If you take antivirals, and avoid sex during an outbreak, there is a 2% chance of transmission per year, assuming sex 2-3x a week. If you add condoms to that, it's 1% per year. Statistically, this is not significant. 

I understand it's his choice, but you also have a choice. If it's making you feel like he doesn't accept you, and he says maybe condoms forever, you have the right to say, ""No, this doesn't work for me."" 

After 2 years, he has a pretty good idea if he wants this relationship to go the distance, unless you all are maybe 20, and maybe then he'll still know. If he's in it for the long haul, then what difference will it make if he gets hsv2 at 40, and you all are still together? 

You absolutely can decide for yourself if condomless sex is something you require at some point in your life. I mean, that's how babies are made, if that's something that applies to you, and you desire. (You don't mention your genders/ages.) 

I'd definitely have an issue with it in an LTR. For sure.",2022-03-26 10:23:42,2

I’m with you on this! i internalized my feelings for my diagnosis. i still feel guilty bc i didn’t know the guy for too long and trusted his verbal reassurance on “being clean from anything” instead of requesting actual test results i can read and look at. but, even then, HSV isn’t tested regularly so he could’ve not known he has it so either way i lose. i feel like ever since my initial OB last month, it hasn’t really ever gone away but i hate the valacyclovir bc it makes me too fatigued and my entire body will be sore. it makes my day ten times harder than it already is with other health issues i have and i’m just TIRED.

I understand he was seeing other people but he came to see me in the new city I live and the fact he didn’t think to get tested before he came to see me is so disrespectful. I’m ending things regardless of the results. I’m a bit nervous because what if it was dormant in me and sex just triggered it? But at the same time we’ve been doing this for almost 2 years and this hasn’t happened ever until now.

to4flj,Like everything was normal before her then after I couldn’t have sex from the pain then and she thought she wasn’t attractive too me but it was the pain pull my foreskin back and seen the sore now my penis is inflamed and red I for the antibiotics now also so maybe it will go away soon but it’s forever ugh,2022-03-25 23:59:24,1
to4flj,It could possibly be genital HSV1 (from the oral) but you have to wait for results… but you don’t really know …. And just remember it’s not usually tested in STI panels in general… so either of them could have HSV1 or 2 …. I suggest for them to both get tested by actually requesting HSV testing not just state STI. It’s best to find out who is also positive to protect themselves and future partners…. The first outbreak is the most painful from what I’ve read (31f first OB was in February) but i would take warm baths to help because i just couldn’t sleep at one point,2022-03-26 01:51:08,1

tnldvb,People are so ignorant and violent towards us HSV+ folks. I am of the opinion that disclosure is your choice  and you're not wrong for not disclosing. They weren't going to ask if you if you had it or not so why is the onus on you? Most people who have herpes have no idea who have it and spread it like wildfire so why are we the ones who have to disclose when we are managing our symptoms and actually doing things to protect our partners? I will say that I typically choose to disclose because I think honesty is the best policy but people are cruel and it is a safety issue especially for women. Disclose if you want to or don't it's your decision.,2022-03-25 16:21:30,6

tnw5gp,"When it comes to HSV I definitely think education is a big factor in overcoming a lot of things that may be going through someone's head. When I was diagnosed about a month ago I was in major panic, wasn't too educated and had no idea what was going on. Hardly slept for 2 weeks but during that time I read up on it, watched YouTube videos, looked here on reddit and got support from family and friends. All of these truly helped alleviate the questions I had. Found out some close family friends of mine have had HSV for a good amount of their lives and what they did themselves to suppress and overcome the virus. 

My little sister has a friend who has had it since middle school (15+ years) takes the daily anti suppressant viral, takes supplements such as L-Lysine, Red Marine Algae and Zinc to help boost the immune system since having a low immune system is when HSV typically seems to erupt. She doesn't eat high Arginine foods anymore such as nuts, oats and quite a bit of other food groups. She works out 3-4 times a week, has a boyfriend of 3 years and they have unprotected sex all the time and he has yet to get the virus. He gets checked once or twice a year. She hasn't had an OB in over 6 years.  
The other two family friends that I know of have had it for 25+ years, live normal lives and have an OB MAYBE once a year, if that. They have a normal sex life, both are married with spouses that also have not gotten the virus and they don't really do much other than taking the daily viral suppressant. They live normal lives, have kids and they both have reassured me that they honestly don't even think about having HSV anymore. Now obviously everyone's body reacts to this differently.  
Here are some pretty awesome informational videos that I found while digging through Youtube. Maybe show some of these to her if they helped educate you as well?

And last but not least I found another very informational food chart that shows Lysine v Arginine intakes. L-Lysine is an amino acid that MAY cut the occurrence, severity, and duration of herpes outbreaks. Why? Well, it has to do with another amino acid: Arginine.  
Back in the 60s, researchers showed that elevated arginine levels in the human diet made herpes outbreaks worse. It turns out the herpes virus needs arginine to replicate.  
So what does lysine have to do with it? Simple. Lysine and arginine compete for absorption in the body.  
The idea is that you want to consume more lysine in your diet than arginine. Then you’ve taken a step to reduce the amount of herpes virus that replicates in your system. Once the reproduction of herpes simplex virus is stopped or minimized, it could reduce the duration and frequency of a herpes outbreak. 

And here's that food chart that shows High Lysine and High Arginine food groups; [https://healingcycles.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/lysine\_arginine\_foods.pdf](https://healingcycles.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/lysine_arginine_foods.pdf)

Let me know if you have any other questions, I am fairly new into the diagnosis so I am still learning everyday but it seems the best thing is to figure out your triggers and cut those specific things out of your life to help reduce the chances of causing an OB. If there's mental issues I have heard from many people on here that going to therapy is HUGE or working out a few times a week really helps as well. I started going to a gym myself this week and I have got to say my anxiety and overthinking has really suppressed since going. Hope this helps and good luck to you and her!

tnvy4y,"You can pass it via kissing. so just let them know  (informed consent) in case they have issues. 

I usually disclose G-HSV when sex seems likely, since it’s so rarely a dealbreaker.

“Like most people I get cold sores, and it’s rarely contagious even when you don’t see them. I’ could see myself kissing you, so letting you know.”",2022-03-25 18:45:58,2

tnt6lu,How long has it been since exposure? If it was too soon the antibodies won’t show in your bloodwork yet.,2022-03-25 17:43:39,2
tnt6lu,Sometimes the blood test isn’t sensitive enough (that’s why they usually don’t test for this) you can go back in a month or month in a half and see if you have hsv 1 IgG Ab,2022-03-25 23:09:46,1
tnt6lu,I got tested a week after first symptoms,2022-03-25 20:23:21,1
tnt6lu,Do you know when you were exposed? It might have been before you ever had any symptoms. Depending on how long it’s been it could have been too late to show on IgM but too early for IgG,2022-03-25 20:40:58,2
tnt6lu,"I can’t be sure when I was exposed. I banged a guy end of January and then a different guy all of February/March and got initial symptoms March 6 (sickness, cough/cold and a breakout).",2022-03-25 21:06:40,1
tnsiw0,Just educate yourself more! I freaked out too trust me literally wanted to die and after reading up more and seeing how many people have it made me feel so much better. A lot more people have it then you think it’s kind of like a secret club that no dog talks about. Ive had sex with one person since my diagnosis and I think most educated people will totally understand and realize it’s not a big deal. Just take care of yourself and live a balanced life and that should really help. I’ve taken up yoga and have been going everyday and that helps so much! If you need anyone to talk you you can reach out to me! I’m also catholic and was scared to tell me mom but nobody was upset everyone just wanted to be there for me.,2022-03-25 18:13:55,1

tnocfx,"Molluscum is highly contagious and spreads all over easily. It is also a kid's disease and if you get it over the age of 14, it should resolve fairly quickly (unless you're me and have to have trichloric acid & blister beetle treatments). Point being that it being molluscum is unlikely.

Probably not warts either? Is that your neck? Why are you freaking out?",2022-03-25 16:43:03,1

tnocfx,"I had oral sex from a college girl like a month ago. No symptoms related to std or hiv. She seemed clean and told me she was tested. More recently I got a shave and razor cut and my hair grew back. When it grew back my neck was red and itching but no bumps. I also wore tight tight clothing like 4 days ago and wore a new cologne.

tnmcm3,Pimple only. The herpes looks different and in clusters,2022-03-25 15:16:06,1
tnmcm3,"I will say I’ve had a lot of what is this bump scares in the past. My initial herpes outbreak was surprising in that it wasn’t bumps I first noticed. It was intense pain, nausea, and other flu like symptoms. The cluster when it did appear (after I was in enough pain to warrant 2 urgent cares and the emergency room) was on my hip.

I say this not to gatekeep but to encourage you not to freakout about little skin problems. If you see clusters or experience pain then this should encourage you to see a doctor and get tested. 

Having lived with it for a few months now my perspective is: the first outbreak was the worst experience of my life, I wasted too much stress worrying over small bumps in the past, and only I can let myself have feelings of shame. Knowing I have it and have gotten through the worst I feel surprisingly free with the exception I am adamant about safe sex now.",2022-03-25 18:16:30,1

I disclosed to my current GF only a few weeks ago. “I have an STI. It’s a minor skin condition. I take meds to protect you but if we have sex once a week, in 26yrs you’d likely get it.” She said she’d have to breakup with me in 25yrs, lol.

Don't think you can't date around and be happy elsewhere. They know the risks before entering a relationship with you. If it doesn't work out it just doesn't. 🤷🏾‍♀️ I understand the financial part but when you get back into the groove, please start to build yourself up again and get out.

tn9ixp,"You’re not stuck in this relationship, your fear of the unknown is what’s keeping you in your current relationship. Relationships are hard and with the introduction of an incurable (for now) skin infection with a stigma attached to it you probably fear rejection of new potential partners. If it’s so bad with your current partner then leave and never return. 

I had a coworker who was in her late 50’s who would always complain about her husband cheating on her and I’d say the usual “I’m sorry to hear that”. One night we were both alone at work (we worked in a psych hospital) she brought it up again and I had a serious conversation with her. I asked her why would she stay married to a man who had a history of cheating on her so often and she admitted she was scared to leave because she was so old. I looked at her and told her she was old enough to be my mother and happiness/misery are options we chose in life. I told her that her husband cheats because he knows she’ll never leave and if she wanted to change her life she had to take action and break that cycle by removing herself from it. She agreed but guess what she’s still with him and still complains. 

The point is this is your life and you have the power to change it, but that takes effort. I’m sure you can make a clean break from this guy and finally create the happiness you’re looking for. Learn how to enjoy being single, It’ll change the way you think and improve your odds of finding someone healthy for you.",2022-03-25 01:48:23,4

tn9ixp,"Trust me…there’s way more people with herpes than you think. I thought I was alone and when I started to disclose to the people close to me they told me they either knew someone who has herpes or even dated or hooked up with someone with herpes. It’s really not a big deal. Get on antivirals and start disclosing. There’s people out there that have way worst conditions that are life treating. It’s not the end of the world.

I’m in my 20s. I actually met my now bf through bumble and before him I disclosed to three others whom still wanted to pursue or sleep with me! 

You got this. Get out of this relationship right now and look for something that is actually worth your time. There’s going to be someone out there that will fully accept you for you.",2022-03-25 03:56:58,3
tn9ixp,"I got it when I was 19 last November. Yes it sucks, yes it made me suicidal af and v depressed. But it does get better. I tried to accept my diagnosis more by just telling the friends im comfortable with cuz the more I talked about it, the more I kinda normalised it since before when I hid it I felt more ashamed lol. Ppl don't rlly care about hsv tbf

But then again, the only ppl that actually need to know r ur partners or anyone u getting intimate wth, or doctors ! ~

Also idk the the story of how this came about or who ur partner is but hsv can happen to anyone at any age, sometimes unintentionally. e.g it can be passed even if they've never had symptoms before so they're unaware they have it, ppl can get it even if protection is used, babies and young kids can get it just from an innocent kiss etc . But if he knew he had it and didn't disclose beforehand then yh that's sucky",2022-03-25 12:57:36,3
tn9ixp,Listen I understand how you feel. I felt the same when I first found out and I stayed with someone who was no better for my mental health. But stress is a trigger as to a lot of things. I get it it feel like the end but it’s not. It’s actually really common and some people really don’t care cause they contracted it when they were just a kid by kissing or drink of there parents. Also no one really knows their hsv status because the don’t test in std screening unless you are having an outbreak. I am in my 20s so I understand but with hook up culture there probably quite a few people you know in you life that have stds and like normal life’s take it one day at a time. And remember there are people out there that don’t care because it isn’t harmful to your health. It’s just a stigma but in reality you can have a health relationship with out even contacting it. Take lysing everyday it really prevents and multi vitamin. You can look up alternative medications on Amazon I heard are good. Or talk to your doctor and you can get on a pill that helps prevent outbreaks and even passing it on.,2022-03-25 04:28:59,2
tn9ixp,"Hey! I contracted HSV when I was 16. My first sexual partner/boyfriend gave it me, he cheated constantly. I know what you’re going through and it’s so rough. I stayed another two years with my ex boyfriend fearing no one else would want me. It was so hard to come to terms with it. But now I’m with my current boyfriend of 2 years, he was okay that I had herpes. I’m 20 now and a lot more confident in my diagnosis. Once you come to terms with it. It becomes easier to live with. I’m extremely open to people that I have herpes and it was reassuring to hear friends and other people have it as well. This is not the end of the world like it feels now for you. It does get better and it’s not even an issue anymore (I’ve had 3 outbreaks in since I found out). I’m here to talk if you need. Good luck!",2022-03-25 09:50:51,2
tn9ixp,"Listen girl. There’s much muuuch bigger problems than HSV.. starting with your partner. If you aren’t happy with him. Don’t put yourself in debt with yourself now. Because the price of your happiness and worth is what matters. vs, the price your going to pay after staying.. I literally left my husband who has raped me continuously..   Dealt with a bunch of really shitty things. And then got hsv from receiving oral from a girl, like 4 months ago.  Honestly. You will be loved. You will come out from this stronger. This is a big/ yet small part of our lives.     Also. If you can’t even afford to be alone. Girl. You can, I’m a part time single mom and I work 80 hours a week to sustain my life. Grow balls tell him to fuck off and that your so much more worthy. I hope you get to a point that you’ll look back at this time of your life.. and be like “fuck that was shitty. But I don’t tolerate that shit anymore..”


Also in my 20’s :)

Also. I’m extremely open about it. I don’t care what people think of me - there’s 8 billion people on earth. Fuck people’s opinions of something only you are going to be dealing with for the rest of your life.

I usually say “ I have hsvg1- which is genital herpes”. And I usually send off a link. Mostly dating done online these days so I’d rather get it out in the open. Herpes doesn’t discount me as a strong, beautiful, independent woman. And honestly. The people that wouldn’t chance it aren’t the people for me 😅 dm me any time",2022-03-25 12:45:15,2
tn9ixp,"I was 25 when I contracted it. I was with two people prior to my husband (one a fling one a serious boyfriend) both were cool with it and we stayed safe. They were mature and understanding. I met my husband at 27. The moment I met him I knew he was going to be the one I was going to marry. So I went ahead and told him the night I met him. Never done that before. But I laid all my cards on the table and said “hey this is me” but my sti doesn’t define me. He also was super cool about it. I am now 32 been married to him for 3 years and we have a 2 year old. 

You’re not stuck in your relationship love. You’re stuck in your head. I was there once. It took me a year to get used to the idea about dating again and telling people. Don’t let it take that long for you. Seek counseling or even a support group because I promise you’re not alone. There are a lot of people out there that are more understanding than you think. 

Yes, I have been rejected only one time because of it. But I’m glad because obviously that guy wasn’t right for me. 

Keep your head up. Get out of the relationship if you’re unhappy and start moving forward.",2022-03-25 13:09:47,2
tn9ixp,"you are not stuck! i got herpes from a very violent relationship with an abusive, manipulative, cheating boyfriend. and i am now with the love of my life… it’s hard to escape the stigma that society has around herpes, but it’s not a death sentence. don’t use your herpes diagnosis as an excuse to not leave a terrible relationship. once you are comfortable with yourself and understand that your HSV isn’t the end of the world, you’ll be surprised with how many people you already know have it or have friends who have it, etc",2022-03-25 13:57:56,2

tn9ixp,"Please please don't stay anywhere that you do not want to be just because of herpes. I know things seem bleak and hopeless and the thought of being alone with this seems like the worst option ever. However that is the stigma talking and not the truth. You can find so many fulfilling partners who couldn't care less about herpes. I got herpes at 19 and I consider myself lucky looking back on it that the person who gave it to me dumped me. Because like you the fear of being alone would have forced me to stay in that horrible relationship. I am now 28 and have had over 25 partners (some serious relationships others just hook ups) and at first disclosing was hard but after a few you begin to realize so many people do not care, and the people that do care tend to be walking red flags in so many other ways. You are not alone 1 in 6 14-65 year olds have genital herpes. There are so many of us out here living our best life. I am going to attach some resources that maybe can help you navigate herpes and if you need ANYTHING at all please dm me either here or on my instagram Bubblieinblu

tn9ixp,"Hey I’m a 24F and I’ve had herpes since I was 19, however I didn’t get diagnosed until I was 21. I was in a relationship at the time and he didn’t care about it and we stayed together. I only stayed in that relationship out of fear of the dating world and not loving myself enough. When that relationship ended I was terrified but here I am a year later in one of the happiest relationships I’ve ever been in. He accepted me & my herpes. And yes I did hook up with other people in between and they also didn’t care. It’s all about the way you disclose and loving yourself and who you are is so much more than having herpes. 

Please please do not stay in this relationship. I promise you it’s so much better being single and finding out how to love yourself again is so much better than staying in a relationship out of fear. You are strong. You can date. You can message me if you need anything ❤️",2022-03-25 17:06:39,2

tn9ixp,"Chill, I understand, I was seeing this guy and the first time I met with him I told him I had genital herpes and at first he seemed open-minded?? We would see each other etc fool around but he straight up told me afterwards that he couldn't be with someone who had herpes like he didn't want to get it which it is understandable, he did seem paranoid asf after we would have sex. Anyways I ended up having major depression like it was literally my last straw but thankfully my sister checked up on me next morning. I thought no one will want me for having herpes ever and I had low self esteem, this happened at the beginning of 2020 so during the pandemic I was working, in school and got myself a treadmill and I just started working on myself. I told myself I didn't NEED anyone and that it is okay to be alone and if someone truly loved me they will accept me for who I am and if they don't then it's w.e. Theres billions of people in this planet. I'm currently in a relationship with a great guy and at first it took me a while to open up cus I was in a dark place. My advice to you is to get out of the relationship clearly you aren't happy, try to work on yourself IT IS HARD, but you can do it, focus on yourself and if you meet someone ALWAYS open up about your status! Remember you aren't the only person with HSV, there are plenty of us! Like you said you are young! So much ahead of you!",2022-03-25 14:30:15,1
tn9ixp,"One of the first things I read on this sub when I joined, which made an impact on me for other reasons, is: ""Herpes isn't a bad enough reason to avoid a good relationship, and it isn't a good enough reason to stay in a bad relationship."" 

My partner is GHSV2+ and I tested negative for both types when we started dating. We've been exclusive for several months, and we are fortunate that they are asymptomatic and take a daily antiviral. I researched the condition and educated myself on the risks, and found that they were not a big deal compared to the quality of the person I had found. So, yes, you can - and *will* - find someone who accepts your dx AND treats you like you deserve to be treated. You just need to be proactive for your health, be honest with the people that need to know, and have confidence that your value as a human is in no way diminished by this condition. And stop subjecting yourself to someone shitty because you think you have no other choice.",2022-03-25 14:51:36,1

tn9ixp,"Herpes is way more common than you think, a lot of people are asymptomatic so they don't need to get tested. When people do STI/STD testing, they don't COVER HERPES, YOU HAVE TO SPECIFICALLY ASK FOR HERPES TESTING. BECAUSE blood test are not always accurate.

Here is the funny thing. People associate HSV-2 as the only genital herpes, WRONG!! HSV-1 IS ALSO COMMON IN GENITALS!! so 11% of the world has HSV2 and 67% of the world has HSV1(which can be both oral and genitals and there is no way a blood test can tell you where it is!) So actually, 78% have oral and genital herpes as HSV2 can also go to the mouth. A d keep in mind that not a lot of people test for herpes which is why scientists say that the expect it to be at least 90%",2022-03-25 15:57:10,1
tn9ixp,"I was gifted by my 21 y/o boyfriend when I was 17(f). I was so devastated and accepted I just had to stay with him forever. With that mindset, I moved halfway across the country away from everyone I knew and allowed him to mistreat and abuse me. I felt like no one else would love or accept me and that’s the best I could get. F that!!!! I figured it was better to even be alone than be miserable. And even better, I’d say half of people do not care! It’s all about confidence, being educated, and how you disclose. If you start off with, “I have a horrible STD called herpes” and speak negatively, that’s how they’ll react. If you tell them, “I was diagnosed with herpes and get cold sores, this is an extremely common skin condition. This is how I prevent transmission, and here are the statistics on transmission rates.” Keep it open and positive.

It could be. In future you can just tell others that it looked like HSV but tests came back negative. Or nothing at all. I guess that’s up to you 🤷‍♀️",2022-03-25 14:10:44,2
tndi5n,"If you're waiting until after the sores have scabbed then it's certainly possible the swab could come back negative. Swabs need to be done ASAP before healing starts as sometimes the virus is no longer present on the skin by the point scabs have formed.

Did he not test for other things like chanchroid, syphilis? Could it just be an infected cut which led to a bacterial infection in the area?

At this point, if you do not have further skin outbreaks, your best bet would be to wait 12 weeks and then take another IgG bloodtest.

If it comes back positive for hsv1 then, well you already know you have had cold sores since a kid so it's highly unlikely you have hsv1 genitally contracted recently. If it comes back as positive for both hsv1 and hsv2 then you will know you most likely have hsv2 genitally.

You will have to wait some weeks before the test though since your antibodies will not show up if it's a recent infection. The good news is the false negative chance for hsv2 is much, much lower than hsv1, so you can be reasonably sure if it comes back as negative after 12 weeks and you've had a negative swab, that you probably don't have hsv2.

Your second sentence, where you actually describe your symptoms, does *not* warrant your first sentence. 

Herpes lesions do not typically bleed. That would be very unusual. And they usually -- not always but *usually* -- experience at least some degree of sensation when touched or rubbed directly. So your symptoms are not particularly suggestive of herpes and there are definitely other possibilities here.

>Gotta get checked

If visible symptoms are present then the priority should always be swab testing over blood testing (unless the symptoms are deemed to be unsuitable for swabbing, eg very minor, mostly healed, etc). This is *especially* true if there's any possibility the symptoms could be hsv1. Blood testing can be done as *well*, but the priority should be swabbing. This is for several reasons:

1. A blood test cannot detect a brand new herpes infection. Blood tests work by detecting herpes antibodies, which the body starts creating after becoming infected. But it can take anywhere from several weeks to several months before a person will have generated a sufficient volume of antibodies to be detectable on a blood test. This is discussed on our wiki page on herpes testing: [LINK](https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/wiki/herpes_testing). Meanwhile, if visible symptoms are present then they can be swab tested immediately -- there is no waiting period.

2. A blood test cannot specify the location of a herpes infection, or confirm that specific symptoms are herpes. This is especially problematic in cases where people experience ambiguous genital symptoms -- because more than half the population has oral hsv1 (and a full 70% of these people don't know they have it) and so these people will test positive for hsv1 even if it has nothing to do with their genital symptoms. These people may mistakenly conclude that their positive blood test results means that their genital symptoms are hsv1 when they aren't, and when they may not have a genital herpes infection at all. Meanwhile, a swab test will test the specific location that was swabbed.

3. Standard IgG blood tests aren't that good at detecting hsv1 in general. Even after the 12 week waiting period they still miss a full 30% of hsv1 infections. Fortunately, they are better at detecting hsv2 and will only miss 8% of hsv2 infections at 12 weeks and beyond.

Note that there are two different kinds of swab tests available for herpes testing: viral culture and PCR. PCR is newer and is *much* more sensitive than viral culture. Viral culture can be fine when symptoms are pronounced, and in blister like form, or the sort of classic cold-sore-type blister that herpes is known for, and especially if liquid can be readily extracted from the blister/lesion/ulcer. But when symptoms are less pronounced, or not in obvious blister form, then PCR is the way to go if at all possible.

Note also that PCR swabs are less widely available than viral culture swabs. So if you want to get a PCR swab done then call your doctor in advance and ask whether they offer them.

My first outbreak, The first doctor I went to was my family dr and she would not take me seriously and tried telling me it was chlamydia even though I was arguing with her to test me for hsv. The symptoms did not align with chlamydia, but they did with herpes. I went to a community health clinic and they agreed with me that it did look like hsv, and even though the sores were almost dry and they said it might not come back conclusive but they still tried and were able to confirm with me that it was after they got the results back. You want to get tested for many reasons. For closure for yourself so you can learn to accept it. To protect and educate yourself and your current or future partners. HSV and HPV are very simular symptoms in terms of they both cause lesions/warts. Hsv doesn't really have long term physical health effects besides being annoying and painful during outbreaks,  and the frequency often lessons over time. Hpv can have more serious long term health effects such as cancer, the risks associated can be lessoned significantly if caught early, so it's best to advocate and get another opinion.

tmel6s,"And that’s completely fair to not want to talk to them after that. If she told her boyfriend who she knows that you hate without your permission then that’s a violation of trust and shouldn’t be taken lightly. Also, that’s ridiculous that your so called “friends” would put that type of pressure on you when you go out. You disclose whenever you feel it’s appropriate. You clearly know way more about Hsv than them considering her boyfriend thinks he got it from a water fountain 😂 … but seriously, it sounds like you need to let this girl go or explain to her how hurtful her actions are.",2022-03-24 15:00:11,18
tmel6s,"what jerks. are you fucking them then and there in public?? then they should keep their mouths closed. im sorry youre being treated that way. people are treating me differently too, but if someone ever told me how to handle my disease (while being misinformed at that), i'd have some strong words for em. gHSV1 isnt even that big of a deal, transmission/shedding wise. your friend would have contracted it if her man was any good in bed. LOL",2022-03-24 16:45:51,7
tmel6s,"I stopped talking to my best friend over her alcoholic boyfriend at that age. She actually stopped talking to me as I was definitely fine with her as a person, just sick of cleaning up her boyfriends puke...

Anyway, 12 years later and we are happily living together ^_^ perhaps ya'll need a break, herpes issue or not?",2022-03-24 15:22:29,4
tmel6s,First of all it’s YOUR decision when to disclose. Not anyone else’s. I would talk to her separately and bring up the fact that your told her this in confidence (why the fuck did she tell her man) and that it’s not on their part to pressure you in telling the whole world. If she fights back in any way tbh it’s not worth arguing. A true friend would respect the boundary placed,2022-03-24 15:45:08,5
tmel6s,You are well within your right to not to tell anyone you dont feel comfortable knowing.,2022-03-24 16:07:05,5
tmel6s,This is exactly why I have never told a single soul friend/family wise. If they get mad at you or something they always have it to use against you.,2022-03-24 17:48:49,3
tmel6s,That’s no longer your friend,2022-03-24 17:49:42,3
tmel6s,"What the actual fuck? Why did she fee the need to tell her bf? Not cool, first of all. Secondly, sounds like they have some stigma around STIs to unlearn. Did bf disclose to every person he ever kissed on the lips/cheek/gave oral to? Doubt it.",2022-03-24 19:51:28,2
tmel6s,This is NOT a friend! Cut her off! Last August before I moved out of state I told my best friend of 10 years about my hsv2. We were watching suicide squad we were alone in the theater and as soon as the movie got done (we had been drinking) I looked over at her and came out about it. She didnt judge me at all. I had been wanting to tell her for years. I'm sorry you're going though this but you deserve better friends.,2022-03-24 18:43:58,1

tmel6s,Ew these sound like awful people. You should have friends that lift you up and make you feel good and ok. All my friends have been 100% supportive and reassure me how insignificant this is. You should cut them off or talk to them,2022-03-24 21:33:41,1
tmel6s,"Sounds like she is not a great friend. Unfortunately it's through these experiences that we learn who we can and cannot trust. Take it as a lesson learnt but don't let it make you jaded about trusting people. If you value this person, maybe consider talking to her about how this has made you feel. If she's a decent person and worth having in your life she will apologise and you can try to both move forward from this. If she doesn't respect what you have to say and how you feel, she was not worth keeping as a best friend. People come and go in our lives, just because you were good for each other then does not mean you'll be good for each other for the future. Sorry you have had to go through this.

tmel6s,"Just going to throw this out there bc I haven’t seen this yet posted, but does your friend know she runs the risk of contracting hsv from her bf? Regardless of hsv type, it presents itself both orally and genitally. He can pass it to her genitally by performing oral sex. 

Seems like your friend and her bf aren’t educated on hsv. The stigma surrounding hsv is just sad. I recommend telling them that they should do more research on hsv and they will learn a lot, including that sti screening is not done for herpes. In fact, per CDC website, “There is no evidence that diagnosing genital herpes with a blood test in someone without symptoms would change their sexual behavior and stop the virus from spreading. In addition, without knowing the benefits of testing, the risk of shaming and stigmatizing people outweighs the potential benefits.”  A lot of people have it and don’t know it. The stigma surrounding herpes should be changed.",2022-03-25 01:28:05,1
tmel6s,"Sounds like this is not a safe, healthy friendship. If I were in your shoes, I would cut her out of my life. It's not okay that she told her boyfriend. Huge trust violation. It's also not okay for them to pressure you into telling anyone you have HSV. It's hard and painful when a friendship ends but they are harming and hampering your romantic life with that bullshit.",2022-03-25 03:16:28,1
tmel6s,I've been thinking about it. Ever since they got together our relationship has been strained. It's just she was there for me when my boyfriend died and when I was living on my own at 16 and I was there when her parents died. It just seems like a shame to throw that away,2022-03-24 17:01:30,2
tmel6s,"I know it was really frustrating to have them shame me when they don't even know what they're talking about. This is MY virus and I spent months researching everything about it. I'm a science student, I know how to inform myself on something. ""Ok but you should still tell them, I'd want to know"" ok... He has oral herpes (apparently) I've never seen him tell anyone once before sharing a drink or food with someone? But because mine is down south I'm a terrible person?",2022-03-24 17:08:01,3
tmel6s,Lmao. Good observation 🤣,2022-03-24 19:45:50,2

tmel6s,"Yeah I've basically asked her to never bring it up again. Even if it's just me and her. I told her I wish I'd never told her anything, which I think hurt her feelings. And I kind of hope it did. If she continues I think I'll have to cut it off. As much as I don't want to.",2022-03-24 17:04:43,3

tmel6s,"Yeah they know, the reason they do this to me is so ""I don't spread it"". I haven't even slept with anyone since my diagnosis and I'm still trying to deal with that part. But they've done this so many times already. It's hypothetical and thats one of the worst parts",2022-03-25 03:02:51,1
tmel6s,I understand completely but sometimes we have to let go of people who no longer have our best interests. I have multiple childhood friends that I’ve completely cut contact with because I realized they were no longer healthy for me at this point in my life and it sounds like your friend is very immature and does not care about your emotional well-being. Nobody that cares about you would treat you like that. It’s immature and super disrespectful.,2022-03-24 18:06:03,6
tmel6s,"I’ve been having issues with my best friend lately. Honestly, if you have issues, just create some distance and only see them once in a while. That’s what I’ve been doing. I know eventually we will be on the same page again. No use in throwing it away, but taking some space is important.",2022-03-25 01:13:38,1
tmel6s,Some friendships last like this... I also let go of a BFF at 22 (since kindergarten) and tried to rekindle it but nope. So... It's ok. You'll end up with more friends than you ever imagined by the time you're 30.,2022-03-24 21:11:51,2
tmel6s,Yeah i mean you confided in her and she broke that trust. If she is butthurt about it then let her be. Just remember you’re not in the wrong for placing that boundary with her. Fortunately having HSV weeds out people that don’t have our best interest at heart.,2022-03-24 17:29:20,2
tmel6s,Why do they care so much about when you disclose? That’s such a personal choice that people need to make themselves. Makes me think they are projecting in some way- maybe they still believe the false narrative surrounding hsv that a lot of the world still believes. I don’t know. It’s weird they do that to you. My friends know I have it and when I am with someone new they do not tell me when to tell the person my status. Because I’m an adult and I don’t let other people make choices for me. I would let your friend and her bf know that they are crossing your boundary when they give their two cents. Let them know you do not want unsolicited advice on the subject. Hope it gets better.,2022-03-25 03:10:10,1
tmel6s,Sometimes the reality of it all is just difficult. I appreciate you being straightforward and realistic about it.,2022-03-24 18:35:43,3
tmel6s,"You hit the nail right on the head with that one. A little over a year ago I cut one of my best friends off who I have been friends with since childhood. We are both 34 and have been friends with each other since we were 5. It was over the capital riots and I posted something about it and she was basically like ""if this is how you feel I don't want to be your friend anymore"" my mom called her out and she deleted my mom. I deleted her off my fb and havent talked to her since. I broke my ankle the next day so I'm not sure if that was karma or not but regardless I don't really want to be friends with someone like that anyway. I also cut 2 other childhood friends off back in 2015 because one was being a complete asshole to me when my family moved to Arizona and left me to be a single mom on my own. They were my support system with my son and I was struggling with his behavior and having no help. She basically told me to suck it up instead of being understanding and supportive. Cut another one off for being a straight up insane person when it came to political stuff. We obviously don't agree and she's not one of those people who can agree to disagree, she always wanted to be right.",2022-03-24 18:49:38,1

Just because he only gets them in his nose does not mean he isn’t shedding from his mouth. I got my ghsv1 from someone who has no memory of ever getting cold sores and tested positive for hsv1 so an asymptomatic individual who was shedding from his mouth. 
I am.. and you should too (if you’d like of course) will not be kissing for about 4/5 months 😳 to try and prevent oshv1 while building up antibodies.",2022-03-25 04:51:52,3

tndz9c,No. It would not make a difference. The waiting suggestion is more for your protection. It’s totally possible to continue kissing and you not get it.. but it’s also totally possible for you to get. Especially since your body is currently trying to fight it off now. It’s really just your personal decision. If you’re cool with the possibility of getting oshv1 which I assume so since you have been together a bit and I’m sure kissed a bunch .. then continue the make out seshes!

I couldn't concentrate on anything. It'd last from 5 mins to half an hour and if it happened once a day it'd happen again over and over the same day. It would like ""shoot"" me every few sec-mins.

tmfsdt,"So scientifically there is a stigma due the the purity movement which led to a lack of education about sex and STIs. They preaches abstinence in its place using scare tactics to frighten people to not have sex then the HIV/AIDS epidemic happened furthering the fear of STDs and STIs as a whole. 

How we can end it is by educating others in our lives not just partners but friends and family as well. Another way to combat it is to stop treating it as if it’s a huge embarrassing secret and being more open with your diagnosis if every person who had a form of herpes was public honest and open we outnumber those who do not have it. I understand that not everyone is in that comfortable place in life with their diagnosis but until we get there the stigma will always exist. 

If you are not comfortable being open one thing you can do is anytime you hear someone using stigma language or making a herpes joke is to politely correct him without outing yourself. What are usually do in total settings where I’m not comfortable with everyone knowing my herpes status if I hear a herpes or STD joke like “oh my god did you hear that girl got herpes from a toilet seat” 
I pretend to be stupid and go “oh my god can you really get herpes that way?” And I make a big production about Googling Herpes in front of them and I go “guys you can’t get it that way also did you know one and six people have it and most people don’t even know look!” “Wow that’s crazy!!!” And do little things like that this way at the end of the day the person who made the joke knows that their joke is not only not funny but it’s also in accurate.

I really like your doctor - he's rational and logical. We don't see a lot of those here. :)

I was in a relationship with an hsv2+ man for several years before I got it. (I'm female.) We didn't use anything, just avoided sex during outbreaks. I do not regret it. The relationship didn't work out, but my life has been fine since. 

I always say that herpes isn't a good enough reason to stay in a bad relationship, or leave a good one. As you already know, there are a lot of people with hsv2 out there. If you decline to be with her, the next woman you date might have it, not know it or not disclose it, and you might get it.

Condoms conservatively reduce the risk by another 50% (with both condoms and antivirals it's 2.5%) but Teri Warren's research suggests that condoms may reduce transmission by 90-96%, putting your risk at well under 1% per year if y'all have sex approximately 2-3 times a week.

tm48wt,"I can share my experience a little bit to possibly ease your concerns. I was diagnosed 3 years ago after my ex cheated on me. I was devastated and did like you said, did what I could to prevent outbreaks and at this point it's no different from pimples imo, so yes the stigma is a little silly.

In terms of dating, think of it like a magnet! It'll definitely push away a lot of people, but it will also pull the ones with a deep attraction towards you. In my own experience, yes, I did experience a lot of negative comments, neutral and positive comments in dating. For me it was probably the majority of people. Buuuut, do you think you could even be in a happy relationship long term with a majority of people? absolutely not! So who cares if the people who wouldn't have been that great anyway latch onto it. In my experience, if they're someone who's completely turned away by hsv immediately, then if it wasn't hsv, they would've found some other thing to latch on to.

I met my current girlfriend 1.5 years ago and after a while of talking, I felt it was necessary to inform her. She was pretty much just like, ""oh ok, that's whatever, I still like you for you"". She asked a couple of question out of curiosity, but at no point showed any judgment and was just more excited to be with me. Moral of the story, someone who isn't accepting of your hsv diagnosis when you tell them is a great way to see the good in someone. You'll find the people who don't look at you in disgust, but continue to see you exactly the same are the people you want to keep around. Hsv is but an incredibly small segment of our life, there's still a whole universe of thought and life behind that diagnosis, so seriously, don't let others make you feel as if hsv is who you are. Those who do that are unaware is all.",2022-03-24 12:51:50,5

Also, for reference as this group is for educating one another m compelled to give some advice. never trust another couple in the lifestyle, no matter what. The first rule is to see paperwork beforehand. Most couples in the lifestyle go in knowing the risk and most will not cough up the extra money for a 10 panel, so that won't prove hsv/HPV/hepatitis status. . Second rule is never unprotected. Couples can engage in high risk behavior and are not obligated to tell other couples every detail of their adventures.

I ended up getting it almost a year ago from someone who never got tested! I definitely think the people who never test are the ones who spread it more. Sorry that happened to you guys.

tmabkt,"I realize that, I read the post. I’ve been on this sub for awhile and read the stories. And what I’m saying is your post comes off judgy and adds to the stigma that herpes is bad and only people doing sexually immoral things get it and that’s not the case.",2022-03-25 18:00:42,1
tmabkt,Best of luck. I recommend checking out the r/swingers sub. You can find info on other couples mindset and advice from others.,2022-03-25 02:38:01,1
tn7029,u/ooohfuck would love any input from you on this.,2022-03-24 22:17:34,1
tn7029,"If something pops up on lip or else where get it swabbed. 24 days could be to soon for enough antibodies to have developed for new hsv2 infection. Get tested at 12 weeks unless you have an OB ( then get it swabbed ) 

Your hsv1 results going up is not related to a new hsv2 infection. They are separate strains , though some people do test low positive for hsv2 due to 1 , i believe it is called cross reactivity due to igg limitations .  

And the ohsv2 is uncommon , & i’m not sure what you meant by she was exposed & transferred it  ? Do you mean she has it or she was carrying the virus on her lips / mouth from just having sex?",2022-03-24 22:34:11,1
tn7029,"ok yeah i didnt know if the slight uptick in the HSV1 from the most recent test maybe had something to do with a new HSV2 infection.  

I meant by if she sucked some dudes dick before me with GHSV2 on it, or even kissed him with OHSV2, then contracted OHSV2, maybe thats what was on her lip when I kissed her I guess....",2022-03-24 22:39:37,1
tn7029,"She may or may not have ohsv2 , if she has a blister / sore on her lip then it wouldn’t be something she had just acquired, there is incubation periods . Chances are she didn’t have ohsv2 .  But to note that condoms do cut the risk of hsv but do not eliminate it completely as they don’t cover the whole genital area.",2022-03-24 22:54:36,1

tn622t,I’ve been taking it daily for the last 1.5 years because I would get out breaks monthly during my period. Even though I was still getting outbreaks on my period the outbreaks were less severe and resolved quicker. Now I haven’t had an outbreak since December.,2022-03-24 21:32:37,1
tn49kb,"I can’t help you with some of this because I truly have no idea, I’m new to this all myself. But I will say if you preform oral on someone else you could give them GHSV1, Even without sores. I got it from my partner who has OHSV1 and didn’t know, meaning no sores ever or when we were intimate. So that is definitely possible. I also know that if they preform oral on you, you could give them OHSV2 but I think those numbers are lower but I’m not entirely sure. I think since you’ve had it for awhile you have enough antibodies that will keep you from getting OHSV2 . Again I’m not entirely sure about it all because I’m new to this too but Just sharing my experience",2022-03-25 00:12:30,2

tn1egt,Adderall and stimulants also affect the immune system and it isn't just the stress part that activates virus but the immune system can't control the viral load when on Adderall.  But thanks for the insight.,2022-03-25 02:06:32,1
tn1egt,"Trust me. It’s agitating the nerves, which is exactly where the virus sits, and it literally wakes the virus up by doing so. 

Everybody thinks it’s the immune system that controls everything with herpes. But that study above directly proves that if you add cortisol and epinephrine into the bloodstream, you’re going to wake the virus up and cause outbreaks. 

This is exactly why stress causes outbreaks too.  You create these chemicals.  Stimulants do as well. Not because it suppresses the immune system.",2022-03-25 02:29:05,2
tn1egt,How many Herpes viral particles are in the body?,2022-03-25 02:32:08,1
tn1egt,"Adderall:  “Stimulants effects alter the body in many ways. The central nervous system is triggered into an excitatory state and surpasses the body nature state of functioning. Epinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, and cortisol flood the body. The body and mind is pushed into a prolonged state of arousal. The organs of the body become taxed.”

Study:  “Stress hormones exacerbate acute disease symptoms resulting from HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections and is associated with the appearance of recurrent skin lesions in millions of people. Although stress hormones are thought to impact HSV-1 and HSV-2 through immune system suppression, sensory and autonomic neurons that become infected by HSV-1 and HSV-2 express stress hormone receptors and are responsive to hormone fluctuations. Our results show that autonomic neurons are more responsive to epinephrine and corticosterone than are sensory neurons, demonstrating that the autonomic nervous system plays a substantial role in HSV pathogenesis.”",2022-03-25 04:06:58,2

“IF I bite my lips and have open wounds and am bleeding, THEN I can’t give oral which I loooooveee” and actually follow this new rule. Put it on a sticky note and stick it by your mirror for viewing.

Also hsv2 does not like to live orally so your chances are even less likely.

Lastly, as you have hsv2 your body now has protection against hsv1. Hsv1 infection following hsv2 infection is currently believed to be extremely unlikely.",2022-03-25 16:12:31,2
tmr7xf,Thanks for the tip. It’s not something I’m really consciously aware of.

It’s been 4 weeks since I found out I have ghsv1 and all my symptoms have cleared but my lymph nodes on both sides of my groin are still a bit swollen and sore.

tm4dfu,"Your body is actively creating antibodies for 3-6 months after your primary OB. So your lymph nodes being swollen or tender in this time frame is not that odd and it’s a sign that your body is doing exactly what it should be. 

This is also the point in time where you are more likely to have reoccurring OB. Support your body with rest, water and health foods. Xoxo",2022-03-25 03:08:37,1

Also this relationship wasn’t a happy healthy one and I was angry at him. I think ur message is very well considered. 

Also off topic but this is wild, the std nurse told me I didn’t have to disclose because I asked if they had a disclosing service so it didn’t have to come from me. I decided that ethically, I should let them know because clearly they had sysmtoms before I did and were in denial about it, so I felt like I should make it clear to them.

The thing about HSV is, unlike HIV, chlamydia and gonorrhea you don’t need bodily fluids to get it just skin to skin contact. When you’re first diagnosed it’s the most troubling. However, you’ll soon realize that hsv is so common that most people have some strain of it. Your message is fine but you need to make sure that you didn’t already have it in your system. A blood test could of also been used on your previous std checkup. But if it directly after a sexual assault, it can take several months before it shows up on a test and that alone can be a reason why it could of showed clear even if you had contracted it back then.

tks6ng,I had this situation and he wasn’t bothered. His whole don’t care casual reaction when I was so sick told me he must have known. I was devastated and he didn’t care. I really hope you have a great outcome and he genuinely didn’t know. Trust your gut. Good luck.,2022-03-24 02:38:21,1
tks6ng,so what did he say ?,2022-03-24 04:50:02,1
tks6ng,I think the message it good but are you potentially able to have the same conversation in person?,2022-03-24 05:46:39,1
tks6ng,"It’s a great message… somewhat similar to what I stated after my first outbreak and confirmed GHSV1 (confirmed by sore IgM (+), IgG (-) so primary outbreak. I told him it’s best to get tested. Mind you this was a friend i was having this discussion with… they may react in a way you will not expect: anger and frustration (while you should be the one more upset) remember to stay in a  positive mindset. You may not get the support you need from them and they might blame you. But yes this is very important to have because it can change their mindset of how to proceed with sex in the future.",2022-03-24 06:55:43,1
tks6ng,"It's too kind of you, but I think the man should take some responsibilities for what he has done to you. It's NOT your fault, why you have to grovel?",2022-03-24 14:32:36,1
tks6ng,"So i’m going through the exact same thing; and my boyfriend hasn’t been screened in between me and his last partner or two before me. I approached it pretty much the same way as you; calm and collected about it and my message is almost identical. I was terrified to have the conversation since we had been seeing each other for about 2.5-3 months when this occured; and I knew it had to be him because any sex I had prior to meeting him was protected and one day I got hit like a truck with all the initial break out symptoms. My boyfriend took it well and it hasn’t ruined or affected the relationship, and I believe he passed it to me without knowing he ever had it since most people who have it are asymptomatic and “lucky” to never experience a break out. After telling him he even said I know who I must’ve gotten it from and it wasn’t you; so I know deep down he does believe he has it and knows some potential people who put him at risk for all this. It’s been like 3 weeks since I found out, and he’s still good about it, however mine did hit a denial stage. Since he’s asymptomatic, he doesn’t think he has it. He doesn’t want to really address the topic, even though I know he most definitely has it, and he wants to get tested and go through his own avenues of testing to confirm. I hope yours doesn’t hit a denial stage, just because it is frustrating when they deny the facts, logic, and proof of “hey, I’ve only been seeing you and having sex with you, you’re the only explanation of how I got this, it doesn’t come out of thin air.” I’m just baffled at that since it’s like boy I could’ve freaked out at you for giving me an STD but I didn’t at all! I’m at a standstill with it all until he goes and gets a full STI blood screening, we’ve had sex after I healed but since he is in the denial stage of not believing he could have it, he wants to use condoms NOW, even though it’s like boy you gave it to me lmao you can’t catch it when you have it. Good luck friend, if he goes and gets tested please report back on everything!",2022-03-26 19:37:22,1
tks6ng,"I sent similar to the person who gave it to me. He was nasty. And totally in denial. And also having unprotected sex with someone new already. Yes I know 100% he was the one that gave it to me. And the Drs I saw agreed. The time frame of my initial infection can only have been him. Plus he was the only 1 I had been sleeping with for 6 months before my diagnosis so he was exposed regardless. At one time he had a raw patch of skin like chafing on his penis. That can be all it shows as in men. Where as my initial 2 outbreaks were horrific.
I am on antivirals now which thankfully are suppressing it.
I hope you get a decent response from this fella.
A lot don't wanna know about it. Hence why it's so widespread! Good luck! x",2022-03-28 08:16:40,1

There's really just no need to add unpleasantness or drama to the situation, and I think your message to him did such a great job of inviting this kind of interaction. It doesn't mean there won't be emotional things for you to work through as you learn about herpes, but you've given yourself such a great start <3 Also really glad you posted this to give others guidance on navigating this situation that almost none of us were adequately prepared for!",2022-03-24 16:32:21,5

tks6ng,"This is true, but also, we have to exercise the degree of common sense. If somebody had no symptoms  for years, and then got symptoms  only after having an encounter with one person, it stands to reason that is where they caught the infection. If it were a random test after being asymptomatic, then I could see not being able to pinpoint the cause of the infection.",2022-03-23 20:54:10,15

Calm yourself everything will work out the way it supposed to! Once again I was really impressed with you! I know you said you had mild symptoms,  can I ask what kind of test you were given?

tks6ng,I just found out and my anxiety sucks right now. Talk to your doctor and mention that you’re anxious and you may be able to get short term anxiety treatment. I am mostly upset because knowing how common it is I know that most people who have it never tell you.,2022-03-25 14:38:44,1

tks6ng,"They don't test for HSV in the US unless you specifically ask for an HSV test and even then a doctor would be hesitant without any symptoms/open sores or reason to believe you were exposed.  This is because it's so common and low risk.  If they did test for it, you can look at your lab results and it should say HSV-1/HSV-2 somewhere.

Edit:. Here's a link from the CDC https://www.cdc.gov/std/herpes/screening.htm",2022-03-23 19:53:52,10
tks6ng,What did they swab? Swabs are done on outbreaks.,2022-03-23 22:05:29,4
tks6ng,Thanks! Will add it in,2022-03-23 18:26:38,2
tks6ng,Either way you do it...you WILL feel better after it's done. It's still brand new for me but I've been feeling much better mentally every day that passes.,2022-03-23 18:42:25,2
tks6ng,"I thnk you wrote an excellent message. I personally wouldn't recommend doing this in person, especially if you haven't been seeing them for very long. A message is safer for you and gives them time to feel their feelings before they respond.",2022-03-23 21:08:48,2
tks6ng,so similar to me as I said. We had only started seeing each other as well! Ugh...i feel for you. It sucks but as you've been reading it's not the end of the world...you will become stronger from it :),2022-03-23 18:43:58,2

tks6ng,"Yeah that’s a symptom, sorry you’re going through this but you’re strong, yeah I was tested four weeks after and it was negative, I specifically asked for a hsv test. Doctors told me from my description and the fact she uses meds and I used a condom while no outbreak, I have no symptoms and the chances are very low but I’m still going to get another test in 6 weeks but it’s mentally draining",2022-03-23 23:38:48,1
tks6ng,"Yes, in that way I do think mildly hold some responsibility, so I admire you for taking that into consideration. A lot of people point the finger and don’t realize what they could get themselves into. I went full extreme and blamed myself and still deal with shame but I have more reasons than that that I battle with self esteem. It’s just one small piece.

However, I think if you come across overly nice, and self blaming he could flip the script. Whereas there could be an other way that still evokes good, healthy conversation. 

I pray the best outcome for you and I think your a sweetheart and I hope it’s respected. Whatever way you choose to say it.",2022-03-24 02:10:38,1
tks6ng,That sucks. Sorry this is happening. Seems like you have a good mentality about it though,2022-03-23 18:44:26,1
tks6ng,"That’s how it happened to me. I waited a long time to have sex after my ex fiancé, then boom one random hookup in January of this year, I got HSV 2. Had all the symptoms within 4 days. My blood tests were NEGATIVE meaning this a NEW infection - my swab test was positive for HSV 2 on an active sore. I responded immediately to the antiviral. So if your blood is negative, don’t let people get you down. People that are saying it’s too “ coincidental “ need to learn some compassion for this entire community. The person who gave it to me, had a very recent STI panel and they didn’t test him for HSV and then after I had gotten my results he got the blood test and boom he was positive for HSV 2 but he’s asymptomatic. I think your text is very well worded by the way. This is something I’m still getting used to for it happened for me in January and you’re not alone. 💗",2022-03-24 01:05:42,5
tks6ng,Exactly.  Sometimes things are just that obvious.   You’re handling this well and I commend you.,2022-03-24 00:39:14,7

tks6ng,"Reading that just made me feel worse about the stigma.

tks6ng,I’m not sure that saying it’s “too coincdental” shows a lack of compassion.  I was alluding to that only to counter those who try and claim that you can’t blame the person you are sure gave it to you because many in these subs will try to say you’re the one who may have had it forever and not known; despite the fact that it just so happened to have occurred shortly after the first encounter in a long time.,2022-03-24 03:55:41,1

I have both types below the belt.  It’s only a big deal if you let them make it a big deal. Fyi-I always told them early on.   For me it became a way to filter out the jerks.  Growing up when-we still didn’t know much about how HIV/AiDs was contracted and who was at risk, made herpes seem inconvenient since it wasn’t deadly.

tlwkwx,"I'm very interested on the reaction of the Vax. 
I am Vax. Kind of wish I wasn't, becuase I'm wondering if it was dormant or that was part of my flair. 
First OB was within the month of vax

I'm on meds daily now.",2022-03-24 16:32:59,1
tlwkwx,^ I've definitely seen other post & comments about someone experiencing their first OB post Vax and discovering their status. So  if you never got the antibodies test prior and didn't know your status then there's a real possibility you simply had the virus asymptomatic until the Vax this is all a theory but something I've read about on here so anything is possible really so I wouldn't say it was DEFINITELY your boyfriend given the variables,2022-03-24 17:02:19,2

tla843,I am gray for this group because…in my small town the ppl here judge mercilessly. I am in the process of trying to move because even though this group has helped me get to a better place about my diagnosis…my home is killing me. I attempted to “UNALIVE” myself and thank God I failed. This group helps me cope but the shame is inescapable. I’m shame for my family and friends. Because ppl tend to generalize everyone around you that accepts you. I’m nasty and gross and neither are my family and friends. And I don’t want anyone judged because of my mistakes. I just want to climb in a dark hole and go to sleep forever.,2022-03-24 15:23:47,1
tla843,"Counselling and talking through these feelings with a therapist would be beneficial, I think. They would help to put things in perspective and drill down into why you think the way you do.

tla843,"Just to bring it to light. Kids grow up with cold sores to adults. Some even died of old age with them. Some of which never knew cold sores are actually HSV 1. It’s nothing to be ashamed about. You can even get HSV 2 from oral with someone that has a cold sore. 1/3 of the population has HSV. I’m saying this, because HSV isn’t a “dirty” disease. It’s so easy to spread by just mere skin contact. I’m not even going to classify it as a STI because it’s not a dirty disease. Of course we still need to disclose it to partners but we need to get rid of the stigma surrounding HSV. It’s not chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis or even HIV. (No shaming on any of them! I hope they get the treatment they need!) Those are typically what most would consider “dirty STI’s” Don’t be ashamed. Live one day at a time. Be happy for who you are. :)",2022-03-24 17:52:54,1

They will not see you as any less than 100% just because you have hsv. you don’t want somebody that only wants part of you… nobody wants that.,2022-03-23 21:35:55,2
tla843,I hope you are able to get past this phase and accept your new self (I am still working on this - just confirm hsv on feb28). It’s okay to feel what you are feeling but do not allow yourself to feel like that forever. We have one life and you can still do everything you wanted to do previously. I’m extremely grateful that this is all I am dealing with. It could be soooooo much worse. This has showed me I need to 1. Educate myself on fucking LIFE and 2. Be kind to my body and treat it as a temple. We are expensiveeeeee - not everyone gets access and if I consider them worthy well you best believe we will be having the std conversation and exchanging results.

tlwfdf,If you tested positive on igg but negative on swab should you retest?,2022-03-24 15:17:28,1
tlwfdf,"Depends.  If you had an OB and had it swabbed late it could produce a false neg. So positive swabs accurate , negatives one you may have tested too late. 

Igg taken at same time as swab or very soon after that comes back positive already would likely mean it not a new infection. May have been a first OB but likely and infection that you  have had a while ( while unfortunately can mean weeks , months or even years ). 

So if your igg is a solid positive especially for hsv2 but you are swabbing negative then you could retest but probability is you are a true positive.  If a low positive and no OB or swabbed but unsure if was hsv then I would retest at 12 weeks post last exposure with Igg or get a western blot.

I have put myself in a bad spot by having poor boundaries about sharing personal items and it’s a difficult thing to go back on once you’ve shared so many times before. So my main goal is to try to put up a boundary with this friend without making them feel rejected.

This is *such* a stretch.  You could have said one of your friends mentioned this without naming her. You've not only violated her confidentiality, but that of her partner's. 

Did you tell your partner about your mom's oral herpes before kissing him? Your mom is infectious even when she doesn't have outbreaks. If your parents are still married, there's a great chance your dad has it, too. Your grandparents, aunts, uncles - most of them probably have it. There's a good chance you do, and you don't even know. 

This is what bothers a lot of us that live with herpes. Others are very quick to judge and worry - and you did both - without having any idea of what their own status is.

Maybe not though but the possibility is there. Have you or your husband ever requested the blood test for herpes? Neither is included in a standard sti testing unless specifically requested.

In terms of Valtrex, I have heard claims that it’s not great to take long term but doctors prescribe it for daily usage and I take it daily. It really depends on your preference. Before my current relationship, I took it before/during an outbreak( I get them 4-5 times a year), but now I take it daily. My boyfriend asked me to so it would lower his risk of transmitting and because he sees that my outbreaks are painful and emotional for me, so he wants me to do it for myself as well. I’ve noticed that in my experience I really have to take it everyday (preferably at the same time) for it to be effective. If I skip a dose or two, I might break out. The only side effect I’ve really noticed is I tend to get a little dehydrated when taking it so I make sure to drink a lot of water. I also think that staying healthy in general has helped reduce my outbreaks- not drinking, no marijuana ( this triggered outbreaks for me), limit stress, etc. and more exercise, healthy eating, taking daily vitamins. I haven’t seen any legitimate studies saying long term valtrex use is bad so maybe look into that.",2022-03-23 16:46:06,3

tljpqi,"Hey there! Totally understand your frustration! I’ll never forget when I asked my doc “so when will I not be in pain anymore?” He goes “well IF the swab determines it is herpes the medication should work very quickly” so if you responded well to the Valtrex - I’d go with the assumption you have HSV. I got my diagnosis in January my first OB - since then I get “episodes” where I’m fluish, or feel nerve pain in my thigh down to my foot and that’s how I know to double up on the Valtrex. So it’s hard to say you’ll ever have sores to be tested again.

tlepqs,"There's a lot of home remedies out there - lots of people on this sub use lemon balm, high quality raw (unprocessed) honey and other essential oils like tea tree to topically treat outbreaks and help them to heal faster, but it doesn't work for everyone. Similarly some people take daily supplements of l-lysine and red marine algae and swear by them to fend off outbreaks, but others find they are of little benefit. In a similar vein some people avoid certain foods, such as chocolate or nuts which contain arganine as these can be triggers for them. Others can eat whatever they like. Everyone is different.

The herpes handbook from westover heights lists a few supplements but points out that there are few rigorous, academic studies (often not peer reviewed) to back up the claims that these supplements are effective.

I suspect part of the issue is that these are natural treatments which cannot easily be patented and marketed by pharmaceutical companies, so there is not the funding/interest for more studies.

Looking at that study you linked, there's limited info on how the tests were actually conducted but it sounds like they were injecting herpes viruses/infected cells with essential oils - this is not the same as applying them topically to an already infected patient... so I'm not sure how valid it is to generalise this study to your average person with hsv1/2.

I think the best approach is to try some supplements out (provided it's done safely - ask your dr if unsure) and see what works best for you. At the moment the most effective treatment, with the most research backing it up, would be antiviral medications.",2022-03-23 22:01:43,3

I tested myself every 6 months. I had the STD conversation with everyone I played with. Which leads me to understand now most people lie or uneducated. Though, I have educated the person who gave me their HSV, he still doesn't see any reason to disclose to future partners.

There are so many posts here ""If I had only known"" ""I didnt know it wasn't tested for when I asked about their sti testing"".

If you know you have it, you have the opportunity to discuss this with your partner by opening the conversation. You may even be sat there thinking ""well they asked about an STI panel and I know hsv isn't on there so I'm technically not lying when I say my panel came back clean"". That to me is wrong and I would feel pretty shitty omitting hsv in that conversation.

It is not our fault or the fault of our partner that our society is not better educated about hsv. Once we get that knowledge, I believe it is a moral obligation to make sure we are on the same page and use the opportunity to educate. 

If a partner said to me ""I've only been tested for chlamydia"" and I slept with them, and I caught another sti, well that's on me for accepting.

Well, I don’t - that’s why I always use condoms. I don’t have sex with people that won’t use them, but that doesn’t mean a lot of (potential) sex partners haven’t tried to get out of it - which means I won’t have sex with them ;)

Transmission of ghsv1 to the genitals of a partner is also extremely unlikely- Terri Warren has never seen such a transmission in 35 years. The vast majority of ghsv1 is caused by someone with a cold sore performing oral sex. Shedding is also amongst the lowest, so risk of transmission is also lower.

Literally there’s nothing worse. You can’t go anywhere with your thoughts that gives you relief. And you can’t tell anyone.  I advise that you don’t, even if you think they’re safe to tell. 

Find people who have it and talk to them. So I hope somebody does call you. In fact I hope several people reach out to you and offer to call. Because talking to people is the only thing that helps. Other people that know what it’s like. 

I had one friend who I knew got it several years ago and I called her. She was my angel even though she hates discussing the topic, and wants to never think about it again because she doesn’t really get outbreaks anymore.

In all honesty, you kind of seem like you resent her a lot for it, I understand your frustration, and spiraling is totally normal  but if that's the case, then you should move on and let her find someone else who is less condensending.

I never thought about it. It's been so long and herpes just slipped my mind completely. Even if I had remembered, I think I wouldn't have thought much of it cause it's more common to have oral herpes than isn't.

If I had been diagnosed with OHSV1 I don't think I would have ended up here. I think I would have thought oh yeah that thing everyone has, and moved on.

Since getting ghsv1, I've told some people I know, and a lot have been like oh that's not a big deal though, I have Ohsv1 and legit never think about it. It's just incredibly normal.

tl0iuo,This is wrong . Regardless of how we feel about HSV people still have the right to chose what they want for their health. Herpes affects everyone differently so just because it’s not a “big deal “ in your life doesn’t mean it can’t take a toll on someone else’s . Just because she had 1 outbreak her whole life doesn’t me he’s gonna get only one. It was very manipulative of her to wait 5months into the relationship before disclosing and ontop of that to misinform her partner and say “it’s no big deal” when having an active outbreak…. Not fair . I’mHSV+ to btw,2022-03-24 10:50:50,1

Newsflash WE ALL HAVE IT and it’s not a big deal.  Now if you feel betrayed and heartbroken okay i understand . But no I’m not going to tell you herpes is the worst because it’s not .

tksc14,"What what you have described pretty much zero chance of hsv, but sever ocd anxiety. 

Transmission if she is shedding (which you don’t know) or OB which is not apparent from your post is skin to skin. Ie her skin where the infection is present , you said genitals to your skin. Her genitals need to make contact with your genitals or oral area or if it’s your hands likely where you have some open cut / abrasion. Not her back that you rubbed. Even if she had some viral load on her hands it’s a fragile viral that doesn’t live long off of infected area. And she would have to have a sufficient viral load to spread from an area where she is not infected.

Ghsv can easily be 1 or 2.  Ghsv1 has become more common due to ohsv1 positive people performing oral sex on hsv1 negative people.",2022-03-23 12:22:28,3
tksc14,"I completely understand your concerns because for the longest time, my OCD was absolutely debilitating and I was constantly stressed about catching anything that anyone else has. However, it is important to note that unless you had sex with, kissed, or shared drinks or food while she was having an OB, you’re very unlikely to contract herpes. I understand how stressful your situation may be to you right now, but take a deep breath and remind yourself how herpes is transmitted. You’ll be completely fine :). But if you start getting a rash that you think could be herpes, go see your provider and they can give you professional help. From my standpoint though, you are just very stressed out and you should be absolutely fine :).",2022-03-23 12:24:39,2
tksc14,No risk. Stop worrying.,2022-03-23 13:15:28,2
tksc14,"If you check out expert Terri Warrens herpes handbook , she will reiterate the skin to skin transmission.  So things like sharing food , drinks and almost all inanimate objects or indirect contact ie she touches something then touches you are just not the way you will get hsv. Only item of concern lipstick / chapstick. 

And a person isn’t contagious 24/7. Only during OB and viral shedding & you need a minimum viral load to get infected. 

Sore throats and coughs are rampant right now , omicron still making the rounds",2022-03-23 15:50:33,2
tksc14,"Hi!

Thank you for your reply. I definitely did not have any contact with her genitals, but I think that because she is on daily antivirals and ‘hasn’t had any issues since the first time’ (her words) that she might not be as careful. For example, I saw her removing her tampon because she had the door open and then she closed it with her bare hands.

I do have OCD, and I do have anxiety. And I’m trying to balance that without being disrespectful or offensive, so thank you.

I’m also worried about the sore throat and cough because of posts/anecdotes like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/gbzo4e/so_im_really_worried_about_my_throat/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) (referring to the comments).",2022-03-23 14:18:55,1
tksc14,"Hi!

Thank you for understanding. I do have anxiety/OCD and the last thing I want is to come off offensive or disrespectful. We did share food (she used her fork to taste my food a few times here and there) but her outbreak was genital and not oral, but I can’t be sure that I didn’t catch anything from her that way.

I’m also worried about the sore throat/coughing systems because of anecdotes (the comments) like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/gbzo4e/so_im_really_worried_about_my_throat/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf).

tksc14,"Of course! It’s completely reasonable to be stressed about it, especially after sharing food. But if she did not have an active outbreak in her mouth I am almost 100% positive that you’ll be completely fine. Take a deep breath and monitor yourself for any symptoms like sores in your mouth mainly. It’s highly unlikely that you caught it so I think the best thing for you right now would be to reach out to any therapist/counselor/support system you have and just take some self care time to help yourself calm down a bit. I know things like this can be scary but you’re most likely completely fine. I hope you feel better soon and let me know if you need to talk about anything related to this!

By encouraging people to donate to these companies, we will get a cure faster. By pretending that herpes is just a ""skin rash"", we're essentially saying, we're okay without a cure.

tk8bhb,"Girl I love how freaking blunt you are on tiktok! Being nearly 34 and new to this it does help a lot. A little rant here but stick with me,

The stigma is so real and people really don't understand what hsv really is. I find a lot of frustration with our medical community, in the last 2 weeks I can't tell you the countless times I've been told its not a big deal everyone has it by the drs and some others. I said I was pissed with the fact that I always asked to be screened for everything but yet was never informed hsv was not part of that because they don't recommend it because of the false positive rate and creates undue emotional stress and because so many people have it asymptomatically and eill never have an outbreak the diagnosis would be too emotionally stressful.. so the small percent that are symptomatic carry the burden of the stigma and the burden to educate and be decent humans... 

If there are ways to double check the the positive results and give someone, though asymptomatic, the education on the virus, that they claim is no big deal, it's so common, WHY ARENT WE. why on tiktok [I don't really use YouTube so I can't say] is it just people like you and other creators affected by hsv advocating and the medical community creators staying quiet? I have searched for one medical community creator to address this topic, in particular gential herpes, a couple of drs stitch a video about oral herpes, to help educate the rest and I don't see it.. does it exist, if they do, can you share with me.

I might talk about it at some point but I'm also not as versed in the science/tech, and think there are more science-minded advocates out there who could probably do more. Again though, because it could take years, \*and\* does rest on the notion that herpes is really serious and debilitating, I don't want to overfocus on that. While I 100% think they need to develop a treatment and am totally behind it, I'm not going to paint a picture of herpes the stigma already has, you know? Just my personal stance.

Herpes isn't ever a good reason to stay in a bad relationship, and it's not a good reason to leave a good one.

The loneliest I've ever felt was in a bad relationship. You can learn to be okay single - you'll never be okay in a crappy relationship. Are you taking care of yourself, physically and mentally? Do that now. 

Learn how to take care of yourself. There are all kinds of ways - there are counselors who help with that, classes, etc. Ask your doctor for referrals. Look for a life skills center near you. Is there an aunt or something you can ask them to help? 

You can do this. 💖",2022-03-23 02:45:08,3
tkjhxa,"Deep breaths love, you'll be ok! I felt the exact same way, I self isolated myself and became depressed because I thought I would be alone forever. I got my diagnosis after I got back in the dating game from my divorce. So I was a divorced, single mom to a small child with behavior issues and now THIS!?! I hit rock bottom, hard! I pushed everyone away, I rejected all date invitations because it's easier to play hard to get than having to be really vulnerable with someone again.  After a while, I started to focus on learning to love myself again and discovering who I was and what made me happy. I realized I am MORE than my diagnosis and deserving of love. I'm also a Christian so I relied on my faith a lot during this time. I know that God has a plan for me and nothing, NOTHING will derail that. Fast forward two years and I am in the healthiest relationship of my life! I spent time getting to know my partner before we got physical, we fell in love with each others personality before our bodies ever touched. He knew about my relationship issues in the past and I was honest with him about how I contracted the disease (I was given it on purpose out of revenge) and he was understanding. He asked questions and did his own research and because we had taken the time to get to know each other first, he knew who I REALLY was and didn't see me as just a disease. He saw how common it was and knew I was the person he wanted to be with, so he made the conscious decision on his own to be ""all in"". 

I know that everyone has their own story when it comes to this type of thing, but just know that you are NOT ALONE in your feelings. Focus on yourself and eventually you will bump into the right person and they will fit into your life so easily you won't have to try at all.",2022-03-23 16:28:24,3

Everyone will be different, but it really comes down to trust. You have to trust your partner to tell you if they think they’re in a window with a high chance of transmission. I understand your concern, but no one wants to be asked “are you gonna give me herpes this time?” each time they’re about to have sex. While it’s nice of you to find a nice way to phrase it, it should get to the point where you don’t have to ask.

tkh8jl,"Yeah dude, definitely don't worry. But take the opportunity to educate yourself while it's on your mind -- HSV-2 is way more common than you might think and a very low proportion of people who have it actually know that they have it. You're way more likely to contract it from someone else who doesn't know their status than from her.

Same with HSV-1, which is extremely common orally and can transmit to genitals (causing GHSV-1) -- not common outside of an outbreak, but also happens all the time. Most sexually active individuals are immune to GHSV-1, though, because they already have HSV-1. I got unlucky there myself, though!

I think most people who are sexually active understand those risks on some level, but don't understand how likely it really is to contract during your lifetime because no one talks about it (partly because most don't know if they've already gotten it). If it's something you're very worried about, you can take steps to reduce or accept the risk (like seeing if you/your partners are already positive for either strain, then deciding if you want to use protection/antivirals, etc.). Transmission is always unlikely outside of an outbreak, but that does tend to be how it happens, when it does.",2022-03-23 17:39:12,1

No.",2022-03-22 07:04:56,12
tjrr9n,"I think what’s interesting about your thoughts regarding herpes is that society generally agrees with this notion. Hear me out for a sec.. 
let’s think about what it truly takes to avoid getting herpes (any type). 

You have to be lucky enough to be born to loving parents who don’t have herpes themselves. As you grow up you have to be lucky enough no one you interact with physically in your family/friends circle has herpes. If this works out, you get to your teen years without herpes exposure. 

Now you’re starting to get interested in sex so you are looking to date. You were fortunate that your parents or family circle have educated you so you know to request a full panel STD test at the start of talking to a romantic interest and do a follow up 12-16 weeks after to give you a high probability your romantic interest doesn’t have any STDs. During the 12-16 week wait between tests, you avoid any physical contact or kissing and you keep tabs on your romantic interest to ensure they haven’t been involved with anyone else physically or intimately. 

Once you verified they are “safe”, you feel confident and the relationship expands to include physical intimacy. You possibly use condoms for birth control but enjoy an STD free sex life. 

But in order to remain STD free, you keep tabs on your romantic interest in the hopes there is no cheating or physical contact (herpes gladiatorum/herpetic whitlow anyone?) with others during the relationship. 

As with any relationship, it may or may not work out long term. If it works out.. great you marry your high school or college sweetheart (depending on when you decide to get into a sexual relationship) and stay together forever only having sex and physical contact with each other. If not.. you remain diligent and you repeat the testing criteria and precautions you implemented earlier as well as the “continuous tracking” of romantic interests in order to avoid herpes as well as other STDs. 

Does this sound like anything that occurs in modern dating? 

Exactly, it’s so mechanical, no spontaneity, no trust, persistent paranoia and possible anxiety. 

Sure there are reasonable precautions you can take to avoid STDs in general but herpes is a tougher one to avoid. Given all the ways it can transmit besides intimate contact, how free-spirited and spontaneous modern dating is, condoms not being as effective against the skin to skin  nature of spread vs. the fluid based STIs, many ppl not getting tested and herpes ability to transmit asymptotically.

tjrr9n,"""I think we should all consider why the CDC recommends not testing if you don’t have very visible symptoms.""

They don't say that surely? They don't say ""very"" visible, they say if you don't have ANY symptoms. It's the same here in the UK.

But if you DO have symptoms then the advice is go and get tested, not bury your head in the sand.

There is a massive difference between advising against asymptomatic testing and advising against testing fullstop.

What if you don't have hsv? What if you have syphilis or gonorrhoea or chancroid or any number of other far worse, dangerous infections that can and will do irreversible damage if left untreated. Are you going to avoid going to a clinic because you don't want to be swabbed specifically for hsv? If your previous partners were not aware of their hsv status, what makes you so sure they are aware of any of their other STI statuses?

Symptoms should never, ever be ignored. Burying your head in the sand and saying you don't wish to know does not change the fact that you may have something going on down there and if you are positive nothing will change that fact.

There are plenty of people in this community who are not into the pity party, who are not living celebate lives. There are large number of people here who dont actually find disclosure an issue and people who have a very upbeat and realistic outlook on their future.

Regardless, anyone experiencing unusual changes on their genitals should 100% be going and seeing a doctor. There are things far worse than hsv out there.",2022-03-22 23:33:10,1

tjrr9n,"In fairness I think the reason is because of the location of the sore and what else they could possibly be caused by.

Most people know what a cold sore looks like - the majority are fairly typical in appearance and especially if someone has had them since childhood they likely have a parent or elder telling them at some point what exactly that thing is on their face, that they cannot hide, and how to deal with it.

But genital sores are a bit different - because there are many diseases and infections that can cause sores and genital hsv does not necessarily resemble cold sores. So yes, it could be hsv and you might be confident enough to say ""yeah that's probably herpes, meh"", but you could also very wrong - it could be syphilis or gonorrhoea or hpv or chancroid or balanitis or auto imminue disease and so on and so forth, and there's the risk of something quite serious. Equally if you get diagnosed with hsv and your partner has not disclosed, what else have they not told you about? What if you are now positive for an easily treatable bacterial chlamydia infection which you now will not deal with.

tjrr9n,"Forgive me if I come across as rude or too direct, but it reads like you're clutching at straws a bit here - I am not suggesting that a person with back pain or headaches needs to get tested for hsv and neither is the CDC/NHS.

It's the classic, physical symptoms of hsv that call for testing. Pure back pain or a headache is unlikely a cause for concern in terms of hsv; yes, these may well present themselves during the flu like stages of infection but often they will be accompanied by other more physical and alarming changes. Of course a person can be forgiven for not getting their genitals swabbed if they develop only a headache (although if they've recently had sexual contact with someone/regularly have sex, a regular sexual health check should be carried out ideally before/after a new partner). But the advice is clear - if you have symptoms of hsv, go and get tested. E.g. itching, blisters, sores, noticeable skin changes, painful urination and so on. Diagnosis should be by a professional, not by looking up symptoms on Google and going ""oh yeah I probably have herpes"", because as I say there could be any number of possible causes and these should be investigated and ruled out.

I don't know what your symptoms are but your original post reads along the lines of ""I have symptoms which match herpes, but I don't want to get tested because I don't want to know"". All I am saying is I think that that is a poor choice for you to make (but it's your choice and your body). You are assuming you may have herpes, but realistically there could be many other explanations and I presume you are not medically qualified to make that diagnosis. You also appear to start your post with advice from CDC that doesn't exist, in an effort to back up your viewpoint and I'm just pointing out that medical bodies never encourage people to just ignore symptoms.

You have authority and autonomy of your body and how you choose to use it. If hsv is indeed not a big deal for you, then better to get tested (if you are experiencing obvious symptoms) to find out if you have it/what else is causing the symptoms and then go from there. Worst case scenario you get complete clarity that you do in fact have hsv, with no more doubt about any other nasties, and you can go back to living your life continuing to believe that hsv is not a big a deal and not worth disclosing.

With out this Christian framework we have nothing so people are failing out of marriages. Having promiscuous sex. Etc. it’s the fall of society. Just like rome. The family structure is weakening and it’s only going to get worse it seems.

So bare min I had it at least 2 years without a full on ob and honestly without any real symptoms to tell me something was wrong

I didn't know via blood test because I wasn't aware they didn't test me for hsv even when I was asking to be tested for everything.

If you haven't been swabbed yet, go and get swabbed ASAP. It may not even be herpes. But its important to swab as it can tell you exactly what type it is whereas a blood test cannot. You may already have hsv1 orally and be asymptomatic, in which case a blood test could come back positive leading you to believe you have it genitally because of your symptoms when in reality you have no genital hsv infection.

I did get tested three times. This last time was 9 weeks after unprotected sex. And 5 weeks since a protected encounter but unprotected oral. 

The symptoms were honestly all over.  I also just got off amoxicillin so I wasn’t sure if it was part fungal infection. Just felt itching in different places. Minor burning at different points. And a very small red areas on the shaft with what looked like the tiniest bump in the middle. These popped up in different locations over the past 3 weeks. And go away within like 2 or 3 days. 

Also had a head ache a few separate days and slight bit of leg restlessness.",2022-03-23 01:15:37,1

5-10 minutes later she gives a blow job. There is a spot where I suspect could be a very tiny sore. But her mouth did not reach this point. But her hand was touching it.  

What I’m also asking is. Can an hsv 1 transmission from the mouth cause sores to pop up in an area that the mouth did not touch",2022-03-22 23:55:26,1

They never swabbed the bumps. One doctor looked at it and said it looked like herpes. But he was also railing on me about being safe with condoms for oral. So I can tell if he was jumping to conclusions. To scare me. 

But at the same time I’ve looked at so many other possible things. And nothing else really can explain what it would be.  It’s on the shaft. It’s a small red irritated area. And a small bump in the middle. No hair involved.

tkfz06,Yes but typically your first outbreak will be very close to the area of initial exposure. But hsv 1 on the genitals is not as bad as genital herpes type 2. With hsv1 down there recurrent outbreaks aren’t as common,2022-03-23 00:03:01,1

Your hypothetical of this girl touching herself and giving it to you with her hands isn’t very logical. Especially if she was touching herself in the shower where water would wash off her hands. But it doesn’t even sound like she had an active outbreak?",2022-03-23 00:38:50,2

Overall I’m hoping I have nothing",2022-03-23 01:56:37,0
tkfz06,"What symptoms have you had? Only genital symptoms? You had both hsv1 and hsv2 come back negative?? Also it is possible to have hsv2 orally so that's also a chance. More rare occurance orally but happens.

My symptoms were just tiny red irritated areas with a minuscule bump that would go away in a couple of days. 

 Subtle burning or irritated. And itchiness in different locations. But I also suspected a fungal infection since I just came off amoxicillin. 

Also very minor head aches on and off and restless leg feeling. Or subtle aches.

Calm down, take a breath. I get that it's hard news to take in but don't be dramatic.",2022-03-22 06:30:24,4
tjsdqd,"It's early. It's going to take time to cope. I was diagnosed at 22.  Life goes on. It gets better. It just feels like crap right now. 

For me, I've started to view it as a way to filter out people. If you dont think I'm worth the risk of a skin rash, maybe we're not meant to be. 

I've been in two very long term relationships since I was diagnosed and they did not have it and never got it from me. I just started dating a new person, and while disclosure is uncomfortable, we are having a good, healthy, and rewarding relationship now.",2022-03-22 02:54:46,2
tjsdqd,"It will be hard, but it will be manageable. Many people forget they have it. Things become much less frequent/severe. Take antivirals. Keep your immunity strong. You will have uncomfortable conversations and maybe some rejections, but it is part of the territory. It sucks and it’s not fair, but it’s your reality now (as is mine). Your mentality effects this greatly. Don’t roll over and die, persevere.",2022-03-22 03:20:34,2
tjsdqd,"Lol grow some balls man. ""My life is over"" lool okay bro.

Ive had it since 23 and im 26 now. Ive had a normal sex life before and still do now. They have medication that controls the symptoms which is the only shitty part about it. Its literally just a small portion of skin.

You realize someone today got diagnosed with cancer, Huntingtons disease, or became paralyzed from the neck down... And you have a generic skin disease that most people walking on this planet have in some shape or form.",2022-03-22 02:53:01,4
tjsdqd,I’m 24 and newly diagnosed as well. It’s been almost 4 months and I can honestly say I feel much better than I did that first month. Get a support system and try to focus your attention elsewhere. You’ll have your moments and that’s to be expected. Just try not to dwell. Take some time to mourn and grieve but know it’s not the end of the world and things could always be worse. Take it one day at a time,2022-03-22 12:27:46,1
tjsdqd,"I’ve had herpes for almost two years and my life feels pretty much back to what it felt like before I was diagnosed! I realize I could have easily had herpes long before my first symptoms and never known because I was never tested until I did have symptoms. 

I’ve had plenty of sex, casual or otherwise, and I’ve learned the best ways to disclose. Most people didn’t make it a big deal if I didn’t get emotional about it. 

I promise you’ll be ok. A lot of people get herpes younger than 24. I know people who were diagnosed at 18. Statistically, there’s pretty close to a 50/50 chance that’s you’d get it at some point anyways. 

If you have any questions or just want to vent, we’re here for you!",2022-03-22 17:38:29,1

tjsdqd,"I truly appreciate you sending these resources because they may be beneficial to some but I would like to ask; what good would seeking help be besides attempting to cover up the facts of the matter? I can tell myself there is support for me out there but the barebones situation for me is that I am poisoned with an unenviable condition. After having many relationships fail before I had this happened to me, what is my hope?",2022-03-22 03:11:02,2

tjsdqd,I appreciate your input more than you'll ever know. I'm sure that you initially telling them was difficult but did you find that their reactions in those long term relations were difficult to manage? Were they maybe more understanding than you initially thought? I also understand if you don't want to share this.,2022-03-22 03:20:11,1
tjsdqd,I'm worried to take the antivirals over the side effects. That is a part of the problem. I just don't want to experience the inevitable rejections as well. I just want it all to end and wish it was a dream but I know everyone in my position feels that way.,2022-03-22 03:52:41,1

tjsdqd,Why bother commenting if you’re not actually going to offer any help?,2022-03-22 05:04:35,1
tjsdqd,I appreciate you sharing this. In my case I don't want to find a support group. With my mindset it won't help. I can't not dwell on this. Last night I was an idiot and got drunk and that's the only thing that got my mind off of the situation for even a second. Waking up this morning I just feel like I can't function. I can't focus on my work because none of this stupid shit I'm doing seems to matter now.,2022-03-22 14:40:04,1
tjsdqd,"The purpose of the groups is to meaningfully change your perspective - the hopelessness and poison and all that.

You used a great word here - “unenviable.”  Having herpes is certainly unenviable, but it’s also _not_ the end of life as you know it, it’s _not_ a nail in the coffin for finding love or happiness or any of that.  Not by any stretch.  Right now in your current (understandable) state of mind, you probably think I’m just being irrationally positive or brushing aside the harsh truth of the facts at hand.

But I’m not.  It’s really not as dire as you currently feel it is.  Again, your current perspective is quite understandable. I think it’s safe to say _everyone_ goes through that initial stage upon contracting.  But you should waste as little time as possible in that mindset.  It will be a self fulfilling prophecy as long as you remain there.

You’ve been presented with a new challenge.  Start working on adapting to the challenge.

You’ll still date.  You’ll still find love.  You won’t have to compromise.  This virus is both very common and it also seems like a much bigger deal than it is.

Some people benefit greatly from the support groups.  But your intuition is likely right - it’s a group therapy session that’s probably mostly encouragement and positivity and “you’re not alone” type of messaging.  I wouldn’t know because I’ve never participated in one and would never feel a need to.

My low-resolution read on you just from your post and comment here is that you’re probably more like me.  You want to engage with reality on a rational and factual basis.

My recommendation is hop on Google Scholar and start researching HSV.  Read the clinical papers about it.  Come to grasp the dispassionate truths of what it is and what it is not. Research how the virus operates in your nervous system, the family of viruses that HSV is in, research transmission variables and rates, recurrence variables and rates, the therapies that work and don’t work, etc.  

If you’re anything like me, you’ll quickly start to feel relief from that existential anxiety by doing so.  We’re also seriously close to vaccines and cures.  Like <5 years.  There’s no better time in history to become part of the 20-30% of the global population with genital HSV.

You’re going to be fine chief.  Keep your head up and that rational mind of yours engaged in productive digestion of the ultimately mostly harmless pathogen you now carry alongside a billion+ other humans currently alive.",2022-03-22 03:51:36,5

It’s up to you. Good luck.",2022-03-22 05:47:43,2
tjsdqd,"There’s multiple ways to look at things, if that’s how you see it and receive then yes, your life is over before it started or I would suggest learn as much as you can about this virus that floats around this planet and set yourself on a new course, it’s frustrating yes, bc who would sign up for this? Just part of this incredible eco system we’re in roll with it don’t let it define u",2022-03-22 03:01:00,4
tjsdqd,"It is exactly a ""calm down type of ordeal"". You're going to work yourself up into a nervous breakdown over a completely manageable situation. 

It sucks. But it is NOT the end of your life. It's just another challenge you have to go through. What's done is done, you can't change it, you just have to live with it. There are a lot of things in the world worse than this.",2022-03-22 16:40:20,2
tjsdqd,"The disclosure is uncomfortable. And yes, I've  had some rejections. But in my 5 year then later my 6 year relationship, both partners (M) an I (F) had normal sex lives. My current 3 month relationship has a normal sex life. None of them had HSV (that they knew of) before or after.

Long term responses... Honestly it just felt normal like relationship stuff. Sometimes I'd say ""hey I'm out of commission for a couple weeks"" or ""no sex right now"" or ""it's not a good time"" and they'd understand. When I was healthy again, I'd let them know we were ""all good.""",2022-03-22 13:30:00,1

L-Lysine and red marine algae are supplements that can help, also! You might not have any inevitable rejections, it’s hard to say when it comes to relationships.

I know it feels like the end of the world right now. I felt those exactly feelings. I felt like everything I did and worked toward up until that point was worthless and that’s not true at all. You don’t have to join a support group but definitely find someone to talk to or vent to about what’s going on. If you don’t feel comfortable telling anyone you know try a therapist. Do it whenever you feel comfortable. I promise you, you’ll be glad you did.",2022-03-22 17:01:55,1
tjsdqd,I 100% agree that we're alike in the way that you assumed. I've done plenty of research including through Google Scholar since last Saturday. It helped me none but reassured my thoughts plenty. Rational thinking or not does not change the fact that there is a point you can't come back from.,2022-03-22 04:22:40,0
tjsdqd,Well then yeah I'm definitely fucked then. I can't see any possible outcome in which I have a chance at this point. I was already struggling and now this diagnosis is just all I fucking needed,2022-03-22 13:59:10,1
tjsdqd,I can't handle that rejection from it. I don't want to even tell anyone about this. I was supposed to be going out with this girl coming up and now I don't even want to do that. I'm stuck,2022-03-22 14:45:08,1
tjsdqd,I see. I don't want to take them over the long term effects which is what really worries me. I don't want a byproduct of this condition to affect me.,2022-03-22 04:04:46,1
tjsdqd,What is your problem?,2022-03-22 03:12:05,4
tjsdqd,"There are also emotional states of mind that no amount of rationality can offer clarity from.  I’d know because I’ve been in plenty of them in my life.  Fortunately they’re almost always short lived - except heartbreak. Lol.  

Just give it a couple weeks bro.  I’ll check back on you.  Guarantee you you’ll be feeling calmer about the whole thing.  You’re never going to be excited to have it, but I promise it’s not the end of life in any dramatic sense.  Remember - 
 1 in 10 women (or men) in your age cohort (aka your dating pool) already have genital herpes.  You’re not doomed to a sexless life or lowering your standards to find the one.  Countless other variables play a much larger role in narrowing dating pool.  Would you be better off without this extra variable? Mathematically - yes. Of course.  But does this earth shatteringly alter your ability to find your person? Not even close.",2022-03-22 04:44:50,3

tjsdqd,"I appreciate you wanting to check and also offering your thoughts on this.

Now that I've sobered up after yesterday I'm in an even worse place mentally. I feel disgusting and that I'm just stuck now. From as young as I can remember I've had HSV-1. I've always understood it's something I can't get rid of but it didn't change my future. I haven't had any cold sore outbreaks for a long time now anyways. This is so much different. All I've wanted was to work hard and work on myself so I can get what I want in life to be truly happy and find a good person. Since my last breakup, I've only had 2 different sexual partners but have been dating around in which none of those situations worked out. This happening to me has derailed all of my plans to eventually find a good person for me like I wanted. Cold sores are one thing but to be poisoned with something that will cause me to change my life from this point forward is unbearable to me.

Hell even having a casual hookup is impossible now because I'll have to mention some fucking condition I have that can spread to them even if using protection. What a fucking joke this is. I was planning on going out with someone coming up shortly but I don't want to even want to meet them now or anyone new. If things happen to go well with them or anyone down the road I know I can't handle them looking at me like I'm disgusting and rejecting me.

I don't feel of this as a self-fulfilling prophecy type of thing but more of a harsh reality situation. I've researched this condition all week and any comfort I would find would be in a world where humans are rational thinking and would understand that this shouldn't be a deal breaker. But sadly life isn't that way.

At this point this comment is one big incohesive mess but your thoughts are very much valued and I appreciate you adding your input on this thread.",2022-03-22 15:22:11,1

tjzk4q,"well, over a span of A YEAR the woman has a 10% chance of contracting it without protection (sex 2-3 times a week), around 5% with antivirals and well below 1% with antivirals and condoms. keep in mind, this isn’t with every sexual act, it’s over the span of a year. i think per sexual act it’s about 0.0018%.",2022-03-22 15:47:02,1
tjzk4q,"If you are the male you need to be very careful while having an OB. It’s easier for you to pass it to a female, rather than a + female passing to a -male. 

Doesn’t guarantee she now has it but she should be cautious watching out for symptoms and moving forward use protection when you have an OB or think you’re getting one with anyone who is negative.",2022-03-22 22:14:22,1

After him, I had my first disclosure that resulted in a relationship. He was very cool and fairly dismissive about it, I always kinda thought maybe he already had it or something because we definitely had unprotected sex during my many outbreaks. Mine are mild and I can’t/don’t take antivirals. I brought it up casually throughout the relationship, indirectly asking if he experienced an OB. Not together anymore but as far as I know/saw on his dick he never had an OB. Again, could be he already had it. Not a lot of data for you but that’s my experience 🙂",2022-03-23 06:38:23,1

tk3vlw,"I’m in the same boat as you right now. Asymptomatic and unsure if I have it, but concerned about accidentally passing it on to someone else. You really just need to ask yourself - Would you be able to live with yourself in the off-chance that you DO asymptomatically have it and gave it to someone else who ended up experiencing symptoms from it?

If your answer is no, that you couldn’t live with yourself, then there’s really nothing to do besides get tested and check if you have it. 

On the other hand, if you could live with that scenario happening, then stop worrying until you have a reason to (like observing visible sores).

At the end of the day, it all comes down to who you are. I have friends with HSV who got tested and diagnosed, always disclose, and have wonderful sex lives still. But I also know people who don’t always disclose (like the person I may have contracted it from) and as long as they can live with that, then I’m sure their life will be just great as well.",2022-03-22 16:21:04,1

They don’t put the test on a standard panel of STD test for a reason! Save yourself the trouble unless you’re willing to pay for the right test or again can swab a sore. That’s just my opinion!

tk3vlw,I’m not getting tested for it and I don’t think that makes me a bad person. Hsv 1 is extremely common and most people contract it as a child so why should I get a test when I have no symptoms just to see if I have it. I could’ve kissed or been intimate with people who had antibodies for hsv 1 prior to even meeting my ex and still never caught it. And most people don’t even know their hsv status I just think it’s a waste of time to get this worked up over cold sores especially with no symptoms and a negative igg and igM test after we broke up.,2022-03-22 16:38:19,2

tk3vlw,"No I don’t think it makes you a bad person.

tk3vlw,I was just looking for advice on how to handle the situation. I don’t feel like going through the mental distress if I’ve never had symptoms or an outbreak yet I’m not sure if I’m entirely wrong for not getting tested because I know I was exposed. Sometimes when I read up here people make hsv 1 seem like a big deal but every doctor I’ve talked to about this situation has told me it’s very common and I shouldn’t bother to be tested. I just wanna be responsible I guess,2022-03-22 15:07:11,1
tk3vlw,Wow that’s crazy! Thanks for sharing!,2022-03-22 20:29:09,1
tk3vlw,I think the responsible thing to do is to get the test. Even if it is common there’s still people that don’t have it and it can be very painful for someone who contracts it and has the misfortune of having symptoms and frequent outbreaks.,2022-03-22 15:17:02,1
tk3vlw,"You’re welcome. You seem like a nice person and it’s good to be concerned for others. My advice going through an experience like this, is regardless it’s not a death sentence it’s only a skin condition. People make it bigger than it needs to be, I would actually date and be with someone with this no problem, I would just protect myself the best way I can. Anytime you have sex with anyone there’s a risk, so make sure The person is worth the risk. If people would just educate themselves I think we would all understand this is not really a big deal",2022-03-22 21:26:48,2
tk3vlw,Okay but the person I’m dating probably has the virus anyways… idk if it’s necessary I’ve never had symptoms or an outbreak. I could’ve dated someone with it in the past who didn’t know they had it as well and never caught it.,2022-03-22 15:21:58,1
tk3vlw,He could also have hsv 2 or hiv or chlamydia. Why not both get tested for everything?,2022-03-22 15:25:20,1
tk3vlw,He was tested for everything and I was as well. When did I say he wasn’t? Where are you getting that information for?,2022-03-22 15:26:08,1
tk3vlw,"To be honest, from a third party perspective, it sounds like you’re getting pretty defensive by someone giving you an answer you don’t like to a question that you seem to already know the answer to. I’ve done the same thing where I worry incessantly about something and ask for an outside opinion, and when they don’t give me the reassurance I am directly looking for, I get defensive and come up with every reason to go against them. Bottom line is, if you’re that worried about it, go get a test for some peace of mind. Even if a doctor says “I don’t think that’s necessary” you have every right to be like “but I would like to be sure, please have the test done”. Even if you’re pretty sure you don’t have it, there’s nothing wrong with getting it done just to solidify that fact and get rid of any anxiety towards giving it to someone else.",2022-03-22 16:25:03,3
tk3vlw,You said the person you’re dating “probably has the virus anyways” I assumed that meant he hasn’t been tested for everything since you don’t know if he has the virus or not.,2022-03-22 15:31:49,1
tk3vlw,As I just stated. I am not concerned about asking people to get tested for herpes. It is not recommended for a reason. I am more concerned about accidentally passing it on. I have literally stated that twice,2022-03-22 15:33:29,1
tk3vlw,I’ve already answered that question. The only way to prevent accidentally spreading it is to get tested and know your status for sure.,2022-03-22 15:44:03,1
tk3vlw,Okay thanks for your perspective I would like to talk to somebody else who has actually read through my post and answered my questions tho.,2022-03-22 15:46:21,2
tk2zep,"2. Get tested. Type 2 usually doesn’t occur as often orally. 
3. You can still transfer it to genitals but chances are low.

Obviously everyone's bodies work and function differently, some people have amazing immune systems and others don't so who knows. Probably the best thing you can do it just test it out yourself if you're really that curious, if you start to get prodromal symptoms again I would say it is helping you and you probably shouldn't stop. Also the types of food you eat can be a huge factor in the fact that there's many foods that are high in Arginine which from what I've read is a big helper in cultivating and allowing viruses to grow in the body.

&#x200B;

Some evidence suggests that high levels of arginine can make symptoms of herpes worse, potentially leading to outbreaks or cold sores. This is because the herpes virus needs arginine to multiply. Also, absorbing more arginine may indirectly cause cold sores by disrupting the body’s balance of arginine and another amino acid called lysine

Found this info here \~ [https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323259](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323259)

I also recently found a pretty awesome food chart for foods that are high/low in both arginine and lysine. [https://healingcycles.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/lysine\_arginine\_foods.pdf](https://healingcycles.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/lysine_arginine_foods.pdf)  
From what I've gathered from the chart you want to be eating the foods that are all 1.0+ or if you do eat some of the foods that fall under that category take a 500mg lysine pill afterwards to help negate and counter that.",2022-03-22 17:31:12,1

tjur19,"Sending you lots of love. Let’s hope for a cure. 

Maybe don’t disclose until someone gets to know you. I don’t have advice. I found out when I was pregnant and tested without my knowledge. I am still technically not single and haven’t tried dating yet. But I believe someone out there will know you have more worth than a skin rash. 

I think there should be a Reddit group for people to meet and date with hsv. Maybe you can make one.",2022-03-22 06:22:21,3

Women can disclose and have sex (intimacy) maybe not marriage/relationship but that's still affection from the opposite sex whereas men disclose and it's not passing the talking stage much less a date.

tjoje9,I did. At the end of last summer. Turned out to be a yeast infection. I learned a lot tho and I still lurk here sometimes,2022-03-22 00:01:42,6
tjoje9,Me. Constant red peeled off skin and sores coming and going. Tested negative for over a year with my last negative results coming through yesterday. I’ve decided to let this go. The creams I’ve been using have been helping and reducing my stress. The body does weird things sometimes,2022-03-22 01:22:55,3
tjoje9,I’m hoping this is the case for me. I had a negative test in January. Unprotected sex in feb with a past partner and a few days later had 2 bumps appear. I went to the er she said it didn’t look like typical herpes but I had a lot of new discharge and ended up positive for something called mgen. She still gave me antivirals as a precaution and so I’m waiting my 12 weeks to be tested again. My bumps never blistered or scabbed over but there was tingling. I had some tingling today and see a bump the same as last time so I’m waiting to see what happens. I’m assuming the worse until my next blood test,2022-03-22 02:21:19,3

tk5dyz,"You would need written or verbal proof of them admitting that they knew, you’d probably need a copy of their test results. You’d also need your printed negative test results from before you contracted it to prove that it wasn’t dormant in your system. 

If this is a money issue, I can understand why you’d want to sue. If this is for revenge or to teach someone a lesson, just remember that, unfortunately, it won’t change your status, or your symptoms (which will likely subside with time if you’re like most people), you’ll still have to find a way to live without letting the mental weight consume you (which you can, because I know many people who have and have myself), and you’ll still have to learn to disclose (which you also can do).

Suing this person might get you money, but it won’t force them to disclose in the future, and it won’t make your herpes go away. Most people who take legal action against their gifter decide that it’s more of a headache and even more emotionally draining.

Don’t try insinuating whether I disclose or not as that’s not what I was commenting on at all.

tjehjy,"Well, it’s not recommended for all to be on daily antivirals. In my country (Denmark) we only get medication for outbreaks, and if we get them often, then we get to take the daily antivirals. There’s no reason to take it if you have, like, one outbreak a year (I know it’s because of lower transmission people take them, I just wanted to point out it’s not common everywhere).",2022-03-21 17:16:58,13

tjehjy,I wouldnt worried about being sued then if you have screenshors of you disclosing it. People don't usually win a law suit for getting herpes with someone unless there are other things being tried as well (mainly rape).,2022-03-21 22:40:20,5
tjehjy,You can sue anyone who knowingly has an STI/STD and does not inform you before having sex with them,2022-03-22 03:19:12,1
tjehjy,I think it would be very hard in the US but maybe not in other countries. Cause so many people are asymptomatic and don’t know they have it (at least hsv-1) that it’s almost impossible to prove things. Also my doctor told me i don’t have to disclose for kissing people but I still chose to disclose,2022-03-22 04:14:00,1

tjehjy,How can I do that if they won't ever admit to knowingly giving it?,2022-03-22 05:00:18,1
tjehjy,I honestly think he just wants revenge. He was very controlling for the whole relationship and the fact I decided to leave is killing him. He has also said he was going to sue me for all the money he spent on me in the relationship. Which by the way he threw out a could chunk of my clothes. But yes he’s definitely childish. He did a lot of damage to me and still thinks he is the victim because I left him,2022-03-21 15:51:35,3

tjehjy,Thank you so much. I greatly appreciate the support because it was so hard for me ❤️❤️❤️,2022-03-21 19:03:59,1
tjehjy,"No, no - you aren't stupid. Medication is a personal decision, and for females to males, with just avoiding sex during outbreaks, it's a 4% chance of transmission per year. 

If you add daily suppressives, it's a 2% chance per year. Statistically, that's not that significant of a difference. 

Your ex is an ass who doesn't deserve you, and don't spend a minute blaming yourself. He took his chances, you were honest, and now he's being a big jerk.

I've been using that femiclear ointment during an outbreak and it does help. I think it helped me get back on the bike sooner. I stood up a lot and had to adjust a lot to maintain comfort. I'm not sure about swimming, though I love to do that too. Haven't done that yet during an outbreak.

Also, you have antibodies now. Your body has done all it is going to do. Things will settle down, but some people get more frequent outbreaks than others. It doesn't mean your body isn't handling it.

That being said, some people have mild symptoms for their first outbreak, and if you’re worried about it you can get tested.

I caught herpes while wearing a condom (which I didn’t even know was possible) and the only affected area was that around the base of my dick that wasn’t covered by the condom. 

If you’re worried get a blood test done. Ask for igg specifically. If you do test positive, that doesn’t mean it’s a new infection. You could have contracted it a while ago and just been asymptomatic. 

If you test negative, understand that a *lot* of people have HSV, either 1 or 2. Most of those people are asymptomatic, so they don’t even know they have it. So even if you ask someone “do you have herpes?” And they say “no I don’t,” the only way to really know is to ask to see their printed igg numbers. After asking a handful of people, you’ll start to realize that isn’t really a sustainable way of protecting yourself from herpes. Many people have had cold sores since childhood, so while they’ll say they don’t have herpes, they can still pass it to you orally through kissing or genitally through oral sex. 

Basically, herpes is super illusive, peoples test results flip flop, most people who have it are asymptomatic and unaware, so you can do your best to avoid it, but there’s really no telling who has it! It’s best just to use protection and get tested regularly.",2022-03-22 18:54:50,3

What do sores typically look like at early stages? I read they are usually bumps not what looks like just a white part of my skin.

tjcd2g,"When I was using apps more regularly, I would disclose usually by the first or second date. It would always vary. 

I suggest “practice disclosures” with people that you’re not that attracted to at first so it’s low stakes. If they reject you, it’s whatever because you’re not even that attracted to them. This gets you used to the feeling of saying it out loud, and let’s you practice how to handle different reactions. Not a waste of time at all in my opinion and I’m glad I took the time to have these practice dates. 

Just remember that there are MILLIONS of people out there, herpes or not, so don’t put so much value into what one hot/funny/smart/wealthy person thinks of you. Even if they tick all those boxes and reject you, there is someone else who will also tick those boxes and won’t give a shit or has herpes themselves. Don’t take it personally, if they reject you it’s much more about their lack of education about HSV than it is about you.

tjfo93,"I’m the exact same way. I found out the week after Valentine’s Day that I have it as well, ghsv1 (female). I constantly look in the mirror for sores and wash my hands like crazy too. Always worrying",2022-03-21 16:38:33,3
tjfo93,"It’s easy for me to say this but don’t let this define who you are, it’s a mild skin condition that very rarely appears (GHSV1) if you try and stay healthy, exercise and sleep well. You don’t have to be super strict but just in general and mostly you shouldn’t get any outbreaks. The majority hardly ever get another OB after the initial one. 

Transmission reports with GHSV-1 are unheard of outside of an outbreak. It’s probably the least harsh strain to have to deal with. 

Washing your hands constantly isn’t going to change nothing. Obviously keep up normal hygiene but washing constantly isn’t going to be of any advantage whatsoever.

Just try to move on be normal in your life as your life is still normal. It’s just a virus, but now at least you know you have it and can deal with it.",2022-03-21 16:49:33,3

tjpoet,"I feel like you need to be mindful that you are asking a group of people that do have herpes. I get it's overwhelming at the beginning but you had all the time you were with him and the 10 months following to come to terms with herpes.

I was diagnosed a week ago and i was stressed in the beginning but I turned around within a couple days.

It just isn't gonna feel great to hear about someone that was with a partner but too worried to have sex with them and 10 months on is worried to have sex with anyone cause there's a chance they could have it even though they don't know at all.

I'm mostly saying this for people I know in this group are insecure about it cause I personally don't care.

But as far as what Id say to you. I got it from receiving unprotected oral from someone that was asymptomatic so it can happen. Doesn't mean it definitely did.  If you are testing negative and have no symptoms, don't assume you have it. Just test for it between partners if you want but don't stress yourself. 

Also if you're this worried do be aware most people have hsv1 and hsv2 is also pretty common and most people who have it don't know. So any future partners could have it too and if you care as much as you seem to you should make sure you know their status. That means asking about this specifically since standard STD testing doesn't check for it.",2022-03-22 03:22:18,5
tjpoet,"Have you ever had a cold sore?

What if you have it to your ex?

How did you start assuming hsv2 was a factor?

Im really confused by all this & I’m not 100% sure if some of it is me missing important info because it’s a wall of text with no paragraphs that is extremely hard to read.",2022-03-22 02:29:26,3
tjpoet,">Is it possible that his antibodies could be so high in such a short period of time?

Yes, absolutely. That's 5 months. Antibodies develop within 3 months, and that's all it takes.

&#x200B;

>0.90 for hsv 2

Are you sure it said that exactly, or did it say <.90, which means less than .90, which would mean anywhere under .90, clearly negative. If he had contracted hsv2, that number would have been positive by the time he tested 5 months later. 

You can test, but you were only at risk for hsv1, both orally and genitally. If you test positive, there is no way of knowing when you acquired it - from him, or some time in your childhood or from someone else you kissed or got oral from. Since you haven't had genital symptoms, it's very unlikely that you have it genitally. 

The hsv1 IgG test misses 30% of infections. There's no way of knowing if your previous tests missed yours unless you get a Western Blot test, which is expensive, and without symptoms, kind of pointless. You'd have no idea where you have it - oral or genital - if you test positive, though statistically, it would be oral.

67% of people under 50 globally have hsv1. Hsv1 isn't really anything to freak out this much about. Let it go.",2022-03-22 02:29:40,1
tjpoet,No I’ve never had a cold sore. And I didn’t give it to my ex I was tested for herpes before we started dating and was negative for both hsv 1 and 2. He knew he had hsv because as I stated he contracted it after sleeping with somebody before meeting me.,2022-03-22 02:31:41,1
tjpoet,"Why are you freaking out so much lol
Don’t even bother testing unless you have symptoms",2022-03-22 03:14:30,1
tjpoet,"I’ve had herpes for almost two years now. In my personal (yet unpopular) opinion it’s not worth getting tested unless you have symptoms. 

If you test positive for HSV1, many professionals advise non-disclosure. Disclose to a handful of people, it only takes a few negative experiences to understand why. People are hypocrites. You’ll say “hey for your safety I need to let you know I have oral herpes,” they’ll say “gross no thanks,” you’ll say “well it’s just cold sores,” they’ll say “no it’s not, everyone gets cold sores. Hardly anyone has herpes.” At least this has been my experience. 

Let’s imagine you do have herpes. What’s different about your life now? You don’t have symptoms, it doesn’t sound like you’re disclosing to new partners, and until you have a positive test, why would you? If you’re worried about the morality of it, you can tell new partners “hey my last partner had herpes but we never had penetrative sex, I’ve never had symptoms and I’ve never tested positive for it since.”

Let’s imagine a scenario where you play it safe, you’re celibate until you know for a fact that you are negative for a virus that more than 50% have some type of (1 or 2). Even then, are you really stopping the spread? If you’re slowing it, it’s only marginally. People will continue to have sex, however safe, knowing their status or not, disclosing or not, and herpes will continue to do it’s thing. 

I’m the scenario that you are negative for herpes, so many people carry it asymptomatically and are unaware that the very next person you sleep with who thinks they’re “clean” could be the person who does in fact give it to you. And if not them, the next person you kiss, so on and so forth. 

Basically herpes is a phantom that’s omnipresent and there’s really only so much you can do to avoid it. You can ask to see peoples printed igg levels, but then you have to take their word that they haven’t been physical with anyone since their test. You also have to hope that they were tested after the undetectable period of 2-4 months. If they were tested immediately after their last exposure, there’s a high chance the test is inaccurate. 

I’m just some guy on the internet, speaking from my experience and the other stories I’ve heard from the sub and other people with herpes that I know in real life. Take it with a grain of salt, but my advice is don’t stress. If you end up getting herpes, it’s not the end of the world. Like at all. My heart goes out to those who deal with constant symptoms, but that likely won’t be you.",2022-03-22 19:16:25,1
tjpoet,I didn’t not have sex with my ex because I was too scared of catching herpes I didn’t have sex with him because I’m a virgin and I personally didn’t feel ready to go that far. So I don’t know where that assumption came from. I’m not up here making any one feel bad about having herpes clearly I’m not judgmental because I dated someone who had it. I’m just stressed over the fact that I don’t want to accidentally pass it to someone.,2022-03-22 03:26:23,-1
tjpoet,And then your saying I had the time I was with him and the time afterwards to come to terms with herpes. Yet it’s a little harder to come to terms with the fact that I put my health at risk for someone who cheated on me and used me for months and was just all around emotionally mentally and verbally abusive and manipulative. So yes I have a right to be anxious.,2022-03-22 03:30:32,0
tjpoet,The test results stated 0.90 not less than which is why I’m so worried. What are the chances of me giving someone hsv 1 genitally if I have it orally,2022-03-22 02:44:23,1
tjpoet,I tested one month after our last encounter and was negative for both. Could that be accurate?,2022-03-22 02:52:04,1
tjpoet,Because I feel like it’s unethical not to test being that I know I was exposed to herpes I don’t want to accidentally pass it to someone I care about.,2022-03-22 03:15:33,1
tjpoet,Okay so if I do get tested and its positive should I assume I have it genitally as well? I’ve never had an outbreak or anything. Someone once told me that genital hsv 1 usually appears right after an individual contracts it and it doesn’t stay dormant for long periods of time. Is there any truth to that? Are people still able to perform oral sex on their partners if they have oral hsv 1 like should every person who’s been intimate with someone who gets cold sores assume they have it genitally?,2022-03-23 02:02:00,1
tjpoet,Ah Im sorry I read that wrong as being because of herpes and did assume. The rest of what I said stands though. If results and symptoms don't point to you having it I don't think you should worry. And sex of course can still be safe if you do and doesn't need to be avoided as for whatever else you are thinking could give it to someone you'd want to date like kissing.,2022-03-22 03:47:32,2
tjpoet,"No. It's too soon, and it might have missed a previous infection.",2022-03-22 14:57:35,1
tjpoet,Okay great you should closely monitor for symptoms for the next month or two. After which you can forget about it,2022-03-22 03:33:23,1
tjpoet,"There is no way to tell whether you have it orally or genitally unless you have symptoms. At least to my knowledge. 

As far as symptoms appearing soon after contraction, that might be true in some cases, but definitely not universally true. There are married people who post on the sub that say they’ve been married for years, don’t suspect cheating, and have their first symptoms seemingly out of nowhere, likely triggered by stress. Sometimes one tests positive, assumes the other is cheating, and yet the other tests negative. 

I’ve definitely received oral from people with ohsv1 because I wasn’t aware that cold sores were herpes. They didn’t have symptoms, so I didn’t contract it. 

Having sex, oral or penetrative, with someone who is herpes positive, type 1 or type 2, doesn’t guarantee transmission. There’s a higher chance during an outbreak, and still a small chance without symptoms, but sex with someone HSV+ =/= transmission.",2022-03-23 02:09:08,1
tjpoet,Do you happen to have genital hsv 1 or 2? If u don’t mind me asking.  I’m just curious because you said you had caught it from someone who had it asymptotically orally,2022-03-22 14:11:47,1
tjpoet,Okay so do you think it’s necessary to be tested for it ? How should I go about it,2022-03-22 14:58:38,1

tjpoet,Did you Immediately start to have symptoms after you contracted it or do you think it layed dormant for awhile and just popped up? Did the person know they had a history of cold sores,2022-03-22 17:08:13,1
tjpoet,"It was ONS but when I messaged them to get tested they didn't seem to be aware that they could have it. It was definitely them I was neg before and I had symptoms a week later. I slept with one other person in that time period but we used protection and it was too close to when my symptoms developed so wasn't enough time for it to be them.

There's one other person it could have been to be fair. I just feel like I know. If it was the other one then it laid dormant for a month and then symptoms were triggered by rough sex and developing a UTI potentially.",2022-03-22 18:31:16,1

I highly doubt it's not HSV. I have faliculitus on my chest when I shave, I don't get shiny red skin and 5 or so clear blisters grouped together that itch like crazy.

I'm more concerned with if my beard limited skin to skin enough that my toddler didn't get it or hoping that even if there were no blisters the past couple of days if I scratched and touched him whether or not he would get it.

I was absolutely mortified when I got it and thought life was over. I did some research into what causes flare ups, and how to avoid them. At that point it essentially becomes a super power, it helps you understand when you're not at your healthiest. I've had a few bumps here and there questioning if it'll be an outbreak, but in the 3 years since my first ob, I've only had one, and also met the love of my life on a dating app. (Not everyone is this lucky unfortunately). 

It helps you find the sincere people so easily, because a good person won't care if you occasionally get some pimples down there. I've had people react grossly and I just write them off as someone who's opinion I don't care about. 

All in all, do some research, get a really good understanding of what it is and how it effects you. Look into getting treated medically for it if necessary, there's medicine that can help reduce the outbreaks. There's vaccines and cures in the works, most likely within our lifetime, if that's something that ends up being necessary for you to hope for.

It really bothered me for a few months, but then I met my girlfriend and she was just like ""oh ok, well pretty much everyone has it in one form or another and you're still you"". That moment for me was a lot of clarity I needed to hear and experience. Since then I don't even really think about it at all at this point. It's truly no more intrusive in your life than a big ol pimple on your face may be. Ya it's a Lil gross, but if someone makes you feel bad for something literally everyone goes through in some form (skin irriation/pimples) then fuck em! I wish for the best for you truly! Times have changed a lot since even I initially got it 3 years ago, but stay confident in yourself, and if you weren't, then find that confidence! You're still the exact same person you were before, now with even more awareness and experience. Don't let it define you or your life. The right people won't bat an eye when you mention it and those are the people you want to be friends with. It's a great judge of character. 

Seriously, I found myself using that diagnosis as a way to exemplify the negativity in my life. I wasn't confident prior to getting it, so getting it absolutely destroyed my confidence. Maybe try working out, doing something YOU care about and getting good at it, eating right, could all be options to feeling healthier. It sounds so dumb from your end I'm sure, like oh of course, take care of myself thanks. 

I just bring this all up because my diagnosis, although life ruining at first, turned me into an extremely confident person as I tried to fix it by maxing out my other stats. It's not a bad thing unless you structure your thoughts into thinking it's a bad thing. This could be life providing you a way to spark that fire you needed to do what you always wanted. The first outbreak is also always so so so much worse than the rest. My first was horrendous, now it's no different than just a little razor burn.

Sorry for ranting, that's all just assurance I would've loved to have gotten before. Try to keep your head up and look for the positives in the situation.

There's a specific list of foods to avoid, but in general its just avoid fatty unhealthy food. Surprisingly though I've heard broccoli can increase outbreak chances but I still eat it lol. I think of it as something that's a little more sensitive than normal acne. 

The way I think of it is that it's essentially just acne that triggers a little easier than normal acne. If eating greasy foods, drinking milk, shaving etc cause acne normally, it'll cause flare ups even easier. If a lifestyle change has helped you remove acne in the past, it'll likely help here. Also in general keeping as strong an immune system as you can, since it is a virus. Staying healthy in general is definitely a good preventative. My second worst outbreak was rather recently and I definitely attribute it to be Hella lazy and eating a ton of junk food for like a month.

tjdf72,"Diagnosed at 23, currently 26. I've most likely had many more outbreaks, but I get ingrown hairs rather easily, so any outbreaks that have occurred since diagnosed have been insignificant enough to me to not be able to tell if its an ob or just normal ingrown hairs. At most, I just get a few red spots that are very tiny. In terms of big outbreaks, I had the first one, then one recently where it was clearly an outbreak due to how it spread on contact and noticeably different than normal ingrown hairs. 

The diet stuff I was never sure of, I read that foods with a certain chemical (can't recall the name) can intensify an outbreak, like broccoli or brussel sprouts. I ended up not having any difference either way. 

In general when this happened I switched from eating junk food and being seriously inactive to a completely Mediterranean diet, mostly eating veggies and avoiding red meat. I also ran a few miles everyday. That being an extreme contrast to who I was a before definitely made me feel good and boosted my immune system. A weak immune system is one of the main triggers for an outbreak as well. Again too, this is just my personal experience with it. I cared a lot at first, adopted a super healthy lifestyle (went from 260 to 190), and have since just coasted on that new lifestyle, not really experiencing any issues with hsv nor do I really even remember I have it 99% of the time. I just recently developed /got diagnosed with lactose intolerance at the same time I was eating a ton of junk food and pizza (back up to 220 lol), and at the tail-end of that binge is when I had my second big outbreak.

In general I'd just advise staying as healthy as possible, in whatever way works and feels healthy to YOU. If foods give you stomach aches, or breakouts, listen to your body and don't eat that food. If a part of your body aches, work it out until it doesn't ache the same. Drink a ton of water and stay hydrated. It sounds kind of pseudo-scientific which I hate (I like to know how things work). But it really does work, it eventually becomes almost like a 6th sense and in my experience, really helped me to understand my own body a lot more.",2022-03-22 11:58:02,1
tjdf72,He did a swab or blood test? A blood test 100 percent wouldn't tell you right away FYI !,2022-03-21 21:06:16,1
tjdf72,"So I have a burning sensation between my thighs and my scrotum, and it was hard to get a good view, but I'm about 99% sure there are small white bumps forming under my hairs in that area. Also, my shaft has two new red bumps on the right side that have been getting bigger/worse, and I think I'm starting to see white spots at the base of the shaft",2022-03-21 16:30:34,1
tjdf72,Thank you for the advice .  An as far keeping a healthy immune system . All you can do is eat healthy and hit the gym ?,2022-03-22 13:40:11,1
tjdf72,"Thanks for the info. He said there was nothing to swab, since he didn't think the red bumps I saw were lesions.",2022-03-21 21:09:25,2
tjdf72,"As abstract as it sounds, you are quite literally what you eat. I think eating healthy is certainly the biggest thing you can do to having a good immune system. Working out is the next best thing. Other than that it's more like avoiding certain things; bad air, getting sick, drinking, smoking, too much red meat, etc. Getting bloodwork done can tell you what you may be lacking or consuming that is doing more harm than good. That's not to say I never eat a burger, drink or smoke. I just recommend do everything in moderation and always try to make sure you're getting all of the nutrients you need. Even if you like to eat a lot, eating a lot of nutrient dense food vs plain white pasta or something will be hugely beneficial.",2022-03-22 17:43:24,1

tjhz0k,"Same. I've been suffering from recurrent bouts of balanitis / thrush in the last couple of years and it's coincided with my frequent HSV2 outbreaks.

Try and avoid a steroid cream. Steroids suppress the immune system and that's the last thing any of us need! There is an oral cure - fluconazole - which I can suggest. Cleared mine up super quick.

Edit: fluconazole",2022-03-21 19:36:55,1

tj28mb,how long did your OB last total?? I’m literally trying to figure out if I even have this or not.. I have been tested and got 2 low IGG positives (1.2 and 1.5 index) and my “OB” has lasted a max of 5 days total with no real symptoms other than bumps.. swabs are all negative as well..,2022-03-21 20:04:41,1
tj62rj,I appreciate the simplicity of this post,2022-03-21 13:08:20,3
tjfyio,"Did the dr. not swab the sores you have to confirm the hsv diagnoses ?  Has your partner been tested for hsv ?  Is he positive?  Has he had other partners since he was tested ? The blood igg tests can take a while it come back positive if someone does have hsv , up to 12 weeks .  So testing too soon can miss positive cases. And some people even with OB don’t test positive with igg , misses 30 % of hsv1 & 8 % of hsv2.  If you have been exposed to a hsv + partner it doesn’t  mean you will absolutely become infected , if they aren’t having an OB or virally shedding then the risk is lower.",2022-03-21 16:46:43,1
tjfyio,Ok doll antibiotic cause yeast infection and yeast infection can trigger OB. If you are positive for HVS then you will have more OB in the first year. Ask for several refills of antivirals so you don’t have to wait around when you get OB. Go get any bumps swabbed and get some meds for the yeast infection. Any time you get antibiotic ask for a subscription for yeast and just take it directly after finishing the antibiotic. It will save you discomfort in the long run. Hope this clears up for you quickly.,2022-03-21 17:25:15,1
tjfyio,"Apparently getting the blood test while you have an outbreak doesn’t make a difference. It can still take ~12 weeks for your body to develop enough antibodies to be detectable. If you can, get the doctor to swab any lesions as soon as possible (recommended within 48hrs). I’ve also read you have to be off the antivirals in order to get accurate results from the blood test.",2022-03-21 17:57:40,1

tjfyio,The doctor did not because the bumps were not open sores or blistered. He said he has nothing but I don’t know him well enough to trust him entirely and yea he has had multiple partners between the last time we were intimate. I’ve read that testing too soon can miss and that testing with no OB can miss. Is that true As well? And if I was exposed to it from him in February than it sounds like it would be best to just wait a few more months then.,2022-03-21 17:03:58,2

tj0w5r,"You are talking about hsv1 a virus 80% or more people already carry. The fact that it's genital makes the risk of transmission incredibly low. Any person engaging in casual sex should know there are risks involved. If you are positive for HIV or Hepatitis or some other potentially life threatening disease.  Then yes disclose. But herpes??? No. Ridiculous.  I guarantee whoever you hooked up with already has it. Do not call them for christ sakes. Honestly the ONLY A reason you feel guilty is bc we live in a puritan society where anything on your genitals is considered ""bad"" if you had that same virus on your mouth , where it's ten times more contagious no one would expect you to disclose.  Just reread your post. They didn't even ask you to wear a condom? Clearly this chick ain't that concerned about stds ..please ask her to get tested and in the future ask partners to get a test before disclosing.
Just read your update. She sounds really uneducated . If she doesn't already have hsv1 * which I guarantee she does) and she's that concerned about it ,she needs to pull a Howard Hughs and isolate in her basement the rest of her life.",2022-03-21 02:41:49,32

I felt so awful and came clean to her on the spot. She was pissed obviously. I still feel like I’ve committed a crime against humanity or something, but we’ve had constructive conversations since. Make sure you’re supportive in any way you can be. I think making sure your hu knows that you are genuinely compassionate and understanding of the situation she may be in goes a long way. Also, I don’t know if this applies to you, but as a college student, I’m probably drunk more than I should be and my incident really made me reflect on the way alcohol affects my judgement.

Try reaching out to the person via call or in-person and explain your situation. It's going to be a difficult conversation but letting the person know will allow them to get tested and prevent them from potentially exposing someone else. Or you might find out that they already have it and didn't disclose to you. Either way, being honest with the person may help you forgive yourself as well.

One girls comment here last week really stuck with me.  She was talking about how she and her boyfriend have had unprotected sex for like six years and he’s never gotten it from her, because she simply avoids having sex when she senses prodrome coming on. 

And it’s been 100% successful.  

A bunch of people warned her that she’s still a walking “asymptomatic shedder” no matter what and she replied:   

“Lol.  People around here really hate themselves”.

Because at the end of the day that’s the only way you actually feel better. This unfortunately is one of those subs where I can’t find a single person talking about that stuff.

tjbbcr,"I have the same and from what I’ve read it’s different for everyone. Some have frequent outbreaks and some have none, some get tingling and pain every time and some times it there’s no warning. Outbreaks usually get less and less frequent over time. I’ve had about four outbreaks in the last year and 3 hurt and one I nearly didn’t notice. The first outbreak was definitely the worst! Sex is a trigger for mine so I got prescribed antivirals and I take them every now and again if I’m worried I’m about to breakout so try and speak to a doctor to get some urgently if you’re worried but chances are even if you are about to have an outbreak it won’t be as bad and over time it’ll get less painful and less frequent. Hope all goes ok for you! It’s never a nice place to be",2022-03-21 22:38:45,2

tja67u,"Even before diagnosis I would get flareups of some kind down there after sex with only one girl. Her PH was very acidic, or something. Maybe slightly higher bacterial load. I don’t know what it was. 

But there’s definitely something in vaginal fluid that irritates guys sometimes. My other ex? Sex 100 times a day and never got a single bit of irritation. 

The first girl? Every single time, I would spend a week with an irritated urethra afterwards.  No herpes for either of us.",2022-03-21 19:38:46,1

tj9f1w,Maybe bro! Glad you’re getting tested. Try not to stress until you get results and refrain from unprotected sex for atleast a month just to make sure symptoms don’t progress.

tj8veq,"As for you OP, people have been in relationships for years, kissing their partner for years, and still end up giving them ghsv1. Me for example, I probably had a month of some really deep make-out sessions with my ghsv1 gifter before they gave me oral for the first time, and the first time they gave me oral is when I contracted 🤷🏽‍♀️ it’s all just about the luck of the draw. That’s why when you’re disclosing you should be telling people that your hsv1 can transmit to both the genitals and the mouth… because a lot of people aren’t aware it can go down there",2022-03-21 13:03:31,1
tj8veq,"Do you think hsv1 really prefers to stay oral? I know that’s the general “knowledge” that’d been stated for years but I don’t think the statistics support it. 50% of new genital cases are hsv1.

tj8veq,"I think hsv1 is just so common that we see it a lot more, it has nothing to do with the “preferred location” (its a virus that like wet, warm, moist areas that’s all that matters.)

tizudw,I know this sounds terrible but i wouldn’t stop taking it. I stopped taking mine for 2 weeks and had a horrible OB+ yeast infection for almost 3 weeks. I would never do it again. I’ve read when you take it everyday your body needs it in your system which can cause more OBs.Then when i started the valtrex again to make it go away it didn’t work as well.. should’ve been gone in 3-4 days but took weeks. also heard it can stop working completely.,2022-03-21 01:36:54,1

tj3q1d,"*technically*  the healthcare world and the general public would say not to risk it and use condoms. However, there’s ways to reduce the risk! I’ve heard of people with HSV taking daily acyclovir to help with suppression. Also, waiting a week after an outbreak heals also helps to decrease the risk. But with that being said the risk is always there, no matter how many steps you take to lower the risk. People with hsv can shed the virus without having symptoms. I think the bigger question is if the risk of having unprotected sex with your partner outweighs you getting hsv. It’s definitely something to think about:) sending you good vibes:)",2022-03-21 04:53:22,3
tiwvhf,">If close to 80-90% of people with herpes don’t have symptoms. How do we know how many people actually have it.

From random sampling and testing of the population using highly statistical methods that allow the results to be generalized to the general population with high reliability.

A user made a comment several years ago about how disease prevalence for certain diseases, including herpes, is determined in the US:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/4lagax/i_23m_have_started_dating_a_23f_female_and_last/d3m4z5s

Here are relevant excerpts from the comment:

---

Every 2 years the CDC, as a part of the National Health And Nutrition Examination Survey ([NHANES](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/)), tests a selected group of 10,000 individuals as a representative cross section of the American population. They both interview and perform serological testing so they get to know how many knew they had herpes and how many didn't.

Every 3 cycles they seem to perform statistical analysis produce a report. The latest one of these was the one that found that the average HSV-1 infection rate in the age range 14-49 was 54%. For HSV-2 the average across the same age range was 16%.

This is how they can say with good certainty how many have herpes, including how many that don't know they have it. They are more than estimates, they're derived from proper statistical analysis and the reports are Indeed peer reviewed.

The [1999-2004](http://jama.jamanetwork.com/data/Journals/JAMA/5033/JOC60113.pdf) report has a lot more details than the newer report. It showed that about 30% of teenagers and 65% of 40-49 year olds had HSV-1. 1% of teenagers had HSV-2. In the 40-49 age range it was 18% of men and 33% of women had HSV-2

There is a lot of detail in this report, including reports by gender and ethnic origin. Infection rates can vary a lot in these different groups.

There is a herpes researcher that looked at these reports and estimated that the infection rates of the entire population is about 65% having HSV-1 and 75% having either HSV-1 or HSV-2.",2022-03-20 22:48:18,2

tiwvhf,"Thank you. In that post i see there was a study showing they would group together 10,000 participants.  I’m guessing they would just ask them their hsv status. And not actually test them right ?  So they found. 16% of them knew they had hsv-2. 

But the 1-6 is a further estimate since the majority of people with hsv2 don’t know they have it ?

I’m re reading it now and it clearly says that. My mistake.",2022-03-20 22:55:24,1

What? No, I very literally just covered that in my preceding comment, I'm not sure how you missed it? The people in the random sample of 10,000 people were asked whether they had herpes as far as they knew, and they were *also* serologically tested (ie blood tested, re blood serum etc). That allowed researchers to not only determine how many of them had herpes, but also how many had it but weren't aware they had it.",2022-03-21 03:25:40,1
tiwvhf,"Ohhh. I missed it because I’m slow. I’m sorry. I didn’t know what serologically meant. Assumed it was something else.  

So there’s roughly 60 million in America with hsv2. And that’s as close to the actual amount as we know based off this smaller sample size ?",2022-03-21 03:28:22,2

tj2z0o,"Hi there!:) I’m definitely no expert, I just recently got diagnosed myself. Just from my experience so far (and also looking at doses online), usually the course of acyclovir is 5-10 days. Maybe you just needed a longer dose? I worked in the OBGYN clinic for a couple of years as a nurse, and sometimes patients came for yeast infections or BV, and we would give them a typical dose of meds. Sometimes they’d come back needing a longer dose. It looks like it *could* be herpes. Sometimes when I get outbreaks I’ll itch a lot and irritate my skin, so it gets murky as to what are actual lesions and what are cuts. But it looks rounded and filled like herpes can look like. I’d definitely get swabbed again while it’s still there! Just for confirmation! Sending you good vibes:))",2022-03-21 05:02:17,1

I dont rlly care anymore i realized people in this community dont feel the need to disclose which makes me feel a lot less bad the times i don’t disclose.

I was never that worried about it to begin with but i know alot of people say they'd never sleep w someone with herpes, yet they've never been tested,  don't use condoms and never ask partners for a test.  The hypocrisy is absurd. And no, I don't intend to disclose that I tested positive for hsv2.

It frustrates me that it’s expected of me to be upfront and open, when they don’t even ask me or get tested themselves - and most of them try to get out of using condoms (I was always the one pressuring to use it). And then I’m the one who gets it :))

The thing that makes me want to disclose is that I want to break the stigma. I also don’t want to end up liking someone and then having to disclose after multiple rounds of sex/hook ups. It would break the trust. I would be upset if that happened to me too.",2022-03-20 20:13:01,7

Because I’d really hate to be really into someone, haven’t done anything sexual and then break the news months later and them freaking out and leaving - resulting in time wasted. The stigma is insane. The guy who had given it to me thought it was included on STD panels and he was asymptomatic and I got it. I can’t even be mad because he didn’t know like MANY people don’t because there is no routine testing and a lot of people are asymptomatic as well as scared to disclose. The double standards of “I’d never sleep with someone with herpes” “herpes is dirty” …but when you confront those same people they have NEVER been tested. I’ve had many people go that route with the sigma (it wasn’t brought up with me having it) and I got really defensive because I’m living it and people have NO idea until it’s you.

And now I'm expected to tell everyone when no one has ever mentioned it to me, any of my friends or even any other guy I've ever met?! It's fucking bullshit. It's obviously everywhere and no one is saying a thing about it.",2022-03-20 09:48:31,20

I think what I went through getting it and I would never want to do that to someone unaware of the situation.",2022-03-20 21:09:26,4

tih3fl,What is your body count do you mind me asking?,2022-03-20 12:03:15,1
tih3fl,I was only diagnosed visually by the doc,2022-03-20 17:02:30,1
tih3fl,And how do you feel about it? Are we kidding ourselves?,2022-03-20 17:43:16,1
tih3fl,What do you mean?,2022-03-20 21:15:28,1
tih3fl,"no i dont feel really guilty. because for one if you get an std panel herpes usually isnt tested for unless requested, so if the CDC doesn’t think its a big deal then why should I? additionally 60% of people with herpes are asymptomatic and may never know they have it so if were not actively testing AND people are going around hooking up not knowing they have herpes then why am I going to ostracize myself because I have minor visible symptoms that appear very rarely and very shortly

but it also comes down to the fact i don’t believe there are “good people” or “bad people”, I believe that were all on a spectrum and oscillate around fluidly. yeah, not disclosing is bad but I don’t think it makes you a bad person.

but for context i definitely think there are times when disclosure is necessary and your intuition will usually let you know

oh and lastly if someone asks you upfront about it don’t ever lie about it thats extremely fucked up",2022-03-20 17:16:09,8
tih3fl,"honestly idk i never got officially tested but ive had a few anal outbreaks. I have valtrex for if i feel something coming, usually take it for a few days and then I feel fine by day 3/4",2022-03-20 17:41:38,1
tih3fl,yeah thats pretty much the general sentiment among people who are having raw sex with strangers lol but definitely a lot of people who only practice safe sex too,2022-03-21 01:26:24,1
tih3fl,Im a bottom and always have been so. and like i said i’ve never had a top disclose. I think if the goal is normalization of herpes then we shouldn’t have to preemptively disclose unless you feel an outbreak. if you’re worried then always wear condoms or be monogamous with someone because 60% of hsv+ people are asymptomatic and many of those people have no idea they have it because its not being actively tested for during std panels.,2022-03-21 02:06:38,1
tih3fl,"lol ignorance is bliss, until youre breaking out with blisters on your genitals",2022-03-21 12:45:29,1
tih3fl,Man I feel you. Exactly my thoughts like why does no one say anything. Part of the prob is that if you don't have symptoms people don't test and doctors say no need to test,2022-03-20 14:51:03,3
tih3fl,"No one cares dude. People say they care ,but if they truly did they would demand a negative test before every sexual encounter.  No one does that. The ""you clean? Yep me too"" talk is all people want to hear for false security.  I think if you're hiv positive you should disclose. But herpes? A cold sore???? Lolol that's like disclosing you had chicken pox in 1993. I will never disclose. And these people on this site are the only ones doing that.  Its unheard of IRL . Them they  whine when their hypocrite partner (who's never been tested and has like an 80% chance of being positive themselves) doesn't want to hook up..",2022-03-20 15:23:33,5
tih3fl,Honorable point but at what cost? At the cost that you literally get rejected by like everyone you disclose to? At that point what’s even the point in living? 💀,2022-03-20 23:59:51,2
tih3fl,100+,2022-03-20 12:03:31,2
tih3fl,did they do any testing?,2022-03-20 20:03:33,1

tih3fl,"Thanks, this helps a lot! And you mean If they ask specifically about herpes or stds in general?",2022-03-20 21:35:36,1
tih3fl,Yea absolutely. Surprises me how just people in general all seem to be fucking raw my straight friends too male and female it’s crazy,2022-03-21 08:46:04,1
tih3fl,"so would you still not disclose if the sex were unprotected? what about oral sex? don’t you find it the least bit unethical to not even give someone the option to be at risk or not? 

I do agree that it’s different in the hookup community, everyone is always at risk then.

I know that standard STD panels don’t include herpes, but that typically means the people who are diagnosed get outbreaks. which typically means higher viral shedding (sometimes even with antivirals). I just think that warrants a little “hey, I have genital herpes, do you have any questions about that”.",2022-03-21 04:48:06,1
tih3fl,"Yea look it hasn’t been fun.

But those are people I wouldn’t want around me if that’s something that makes them that uncomfortable! 

What happens if you lie and do get with someone and it becomes something. I don’t think i could trust someone that tells me AFTER the fact that they knowingly kept it from me just to sleep with me. 

I understand the frustration. This shit threw me in a total loop and completely fucked up my life. And I’d be lying if I said I didn’t think about doing it too. Just not saying anything and sleeping around again; and then I remember how upset I was that first day and I just can’t do that to someone else without their consent.",2022-03-21 05:46:05,1
tih3fl,Ffs like this just validates my point. 1 in 100 and she had HSV1. How are we supposed to ruin ourselves? Have you disclosed before?,2022-03-20 12:06:09,7

tih3fl,"When you're thinking about more with a person, do you disclose?",2022-03-20 17:46:35,1
tih3fl,"I was just diagnosed this past week.

I had my first ""noticeable "" classic herpes outbreak with sores. I most likely was asymptomatic or very mildly symptomatic that I attributed my symptoms to something else because there were no sores or blisters present. 

Honestly I'm not doing great mentally, struggling really hard. The ob it's self lasted about a week and I just have an itch now. It was a tiny small cluster of 3 very small blisters, they hurt like hell at first because it was on a very sensitive part of me. So in terms of that I guess I was lucky. 

My biggest fear is dating moving forward and honestly pray I don't have another ob, I had a horrible ear infection which I think knocked my immune system for a loop",2022-03-20 21:35:10,1
tih3fl,"hookups no, dating yes. if someone asks Ill tell them upfront. if not then no. sorry Im not going to be that one person and yeah sure it’s unethical and I know Im not perfect but nobody is",2022-03-21 12:42:48,2
tih3fl,"Yeah I mean like I said. It would be great to if I can disclose and ppl would understand and not treat me like shit. But you know, sometimes the world doesn’t work like that. Ppl can be very ignorant about things. I started off good with disclosing but now I have like 3 rejections in a row and I’m ngl, if it continues, I’m done. I blame society/cdc for not educating/even testing ppl for hsv.",2022-03-21 09:34:49,2
tih3fl,I always disclose. It’s not a big deal. Other peoples lack of awareness/ethics is not an excuse to have none yourself.,2022-03-20 12:06:58,16
tih3fl,you need to get a blood test for confirmation. lots of things can look like herpes. even if it is herpes you need to know which type it is,2022-03-21 06:06:03,1
tih3fl,"Very normal where you are at mentally right now. I have not been doing very well mentally this past weekend as well, you are not alone. I had an outbreak last 4 weeks and after 1 week another more painful and ‘populated’ ob has occurred. I am trying to think rationally and not let this define me. We didn’t choose to be in this position. 
After that 1 month ob I kind of convinced my self my body ‘got over it’ but I received another. For yourself I would be somewhat prepared for another one, and if it doesn’t happen then you have more to celebrate about. Acyclovir has been really helpful for me. At the moment be the best version you can be. I’m rooting for you! And don’t stop doing things you enjoy, sometimes it feels best to put everything on hold, but try to live life and receive dopamine in other ways right now. Put it in the back ground and slowly it’ll get better :)

tih3fl,"I honestly think 1. A lot of people don’t know they have it and 2. A lot of people have HSV-1 orally and do not know it can be passed genitally (not super relevant in your case, but just lends to the huge miseducation of general public because, when do they teach us this besides when we’re 13 and aren’t mature enough to understand or care?)",2022-03-20 14:45:09,5

tixbyd,Was it positive for HSV1 or 2? It could very well be either and you've never had an outbreak. You may have had it before any of those relationships.

tj0ipx,"Ugh you poor thing:( that sounds terrible! I work in women’s health (currently labor and delivery), and let me tell you: YEAST INFECTIONS IN PREGNANCY ARE INSANE. I’ve had so many patients struggle with UTIs and yeast infections during pregnancy. You’re more at risk for both by being pregnant! Go into the doctors ASAP and beg them for meds for your UTI and yeast infection! I’d also ask them for a daily suppressant of acyclovir. I know they’ll start you on it when you hit 36wks, but you shouldn’t have to suffer now. In the meantime you can take topical antifungals like monistat for your yeast infections! Make sure to watch out for the oral antifungal med diflucan, because that is NOT safe to take during pregnancy. Also for your UTI you can take Pyridium (azo urinary pain relief). This med is in category B for pregnancy meds ( animal studies show no harm to fetuses but there are no well-controlled studies in pregnant women). This med works so fast at relieving your bladder spasms/need to piss every 5 minutes, buuuut it won’t get rid of the actual infection. Youll have to go to the doctors ASAP for that. Don’t wait too long to go. Sometimes UTIs can spread into a kidney infection. All in all, I recommended some meds, but if you feel uncomfy at all with the thought of taking these meds, call your doctor and get a second opinion:) sending you good vibes and a healthy pregnancy:)",2022-03-21 05:21:58,1
tj0ipx,Thanks! I already treated the uti a few weeks ago luckily dr gave me antibiotics. I had some monstat on hand since I get yeast infections any time I take  certain antibiotics. I have a weeks supply of anti viral I keep on hand as well I hate the idea of being on any meds regularly for herpes since I don't typically get break outs at all so hopefully this is the last outbreak or ill have to start taking suppressants. Which of course I'll have to do weeks 36 anyway for the baby safety. Good thing I keep lots of meds on hand at home,2022-03-21 06:14:21,1

The underwear is sooo tight and doesn’t fully cover it like i feel like underwear might… it’s just sooo bad and somehow somewhere from something I am leaking and when I am taking my underwear off every time they are soaked. Just trying to think of something more absorbent. Should i wear pads?!,2022-03-20 19:55:11,2
tisy92,I think i may just go with the pad. It’s more for the sores than anything. I am leaking a ton of discharge and then also my sores are “leaking” i guess. They’re open and just kinda secreting now. They have been back and forth between that clear secretions and then yellow greeny film from the blister popping etc. just wasn’t sure. Ugh. I know it’s gross sorry.,2022-03-21 01:06:04,3
tisy92,Thank you!!!,2022-03-23 15:46:53,2
tisy92,Sounds reasonable as long as your alternative is cotton. I’ll defer to the ladies! I’m sorry you’re going through a particularly tough outbreak. I hope only your first one is like that. They usually get much easier as time goes on.,2022-03-20 21:05:42,2

2nd OB again no sores. A tiny spot of skin was very  painful. No sores and no redness but it felt like that spot was on fire. Had the swab test. It was hsv2.

But part of me thinks I should follow what the cdc says and just not test unless I know for sure. And have serious symptoms. 

I generally hyper focus too much and I’m going to try to stop giving a shit about anything anymore. Why should I care. I barely have sex anyways. So I’ll just move on and not hyper focus anymore.",2022-03-21 02:16:38,1
tiz58h,At least your nerve pains are bearable. Some people need meds for them and I don't mean antivirals. I'd rather know in case it isn't herpes and I have something else .-. But it is obs your decision. I'd personally feel terrible if I accidentally give it to someone else when I knew this could be herpes but just never tested so never disclosed 🤷‍♀️,2022-03-21 08:04:08,1
tiz58h,If I have it. At 5 weeks I was negative. So who knows. Only time will tell.,2022-03-21 14:18:17,2
tixhsz,Does anybody have any input please?,2022-03-21 18:50:48,1
tixhsz,"I’m not sure this helps, so I’ve never had an OB, anywhere so I believed.
I got tested for my former gf, (she can’t get pass it)
I tested positive for Hsv-2 and I went all in.
2 blood test at different labs, and finally the gold standard “western blot test from Washington university. I got this shit. All of these are blood test.
I’ve never had a swab test or blisters or anything on my junk or mouth… ever.
But 20tears ago I would care for my mom, who used to get these little blisters on her hands.
She always said it was a fungus so we treated it with fungus spray.
After she passed I started getting the same on my hands, I believed that it was a fungus and treated it with the same anti-fungus as I did with her.
This went on for years. Eventually I never got another OB on my fingers.
After my I tested positive I did research and read that Herpatic whitlow is HSV2 or HSV1 that has entered the body via a lesion, or cut into the hands , I can only point to that place, for my source for my infection.
After speaking to Terri Warren, she said that she would not believe that that’s my source of infection, because nobody has ever had daily testing from that source done.
But my point is a different one. From all the research I’ve done, once you have the virus in your system it only sheds or outbreak at the source of infection. So if you have it on your hands it should not travel to your Genitalia or your lips, because your body has created anti-bodys to protect those other parts of the body.
I would love to hear that I’m wrong 
I hate misinformation but nobody has been able to give me any proof otherwise.",2022-03-21 22:08:35,2
tixhsz,Thank you for the reply! I read something similar but I also read that it can spread within the first few months of getting it. It’s only been a few weeks since my potential exposure so I think I’m still in that stage where it could possibly spread.,2022-03-22 00:38:15,1
tixhsz,"I apologize, to you, Yes I’ve read the same about the time frame.  Unfortunately, I did not think about that when I responded, I’m sorry. I wanted to help",2022-03-22 05:06:17,1

tixdxh,Very 😩,2022-03-21 04:48:25,2
tixdxh,I've noticed that when I first got it. Btw also 20yr f. But tbh then I started using lube even if I don't feel like I need it and haven't had it happen again. Since then even without lube I'm not as irritated or swelled up there after sex. I've also talked to health professionals and they've told me it's because of the kind of sex I have 🤷‍♀️. But yeah buy some lube and over use it I'd say if this is bothering you  :),2022-03-21 08:14:52,2
tixdxh,thankyou so much! do you have any suggestions on what lube works best for you?,2022-03-21 10:27:24,1
tixdxh,Silicone based is better as it doesn't dry as easily but with condoms and silicone toys it's better to go for water based.,2022-03-21 11:37:33,2

tiw53f,Ask to get tested. Some doctors will only diagnose from a visual but ask to get a PCR Swab test done for HSV. Not a blood test. A blood test will just tell you if you hav ever had hsv so even if you have hsv1 orally it will come back positive.,2022-03-20 23:10:03,2

The safer sex conversation should be a part of every encounter you have. You're fine with having it with casual sex partners, so approach this the same way. Maybe he doesn't have herpes. Maybe he has HPV. Or maybe he has something else that will impact you in a relationship, like bad credit or a criminal record or a bad relationship with his family.

It was itchy & pinchy feeling in that spot. Like a needle prick. For me I can feel them coming under the skin before they surface. Like knots under my skin. There were more coming but as soon as I noticed the blister I added more antivirals to my day & used a lysine cream on them a few times a day. Everything went away within 3-4 days. Then I found a new blister on the other side a few days before the others healed. Same story going on with this one. It’s going away.,2022-03-20 15:51:20,2

ti8bec,"Don’t be scared. Just look at the stats of how many people have it too. Get things steamy and then before you do anything that can cause an outbreak just say “I want to be transparent w you before things go further..” and simply disclose what happened and say how many other people have it as well (like 50% or more?). And also if you’ve only had one outbreak you may not experience symptoms again, which is something to share as well. But it’s all in your attitude, be nonchalant and confident about it. You got this. I’ve fortunately had all good disclosures so far where they were comfortable moving forward bc the commonality of herpes or having it already themselves. If they want to have sex w you often times herpes won’t stop them. Just have condoms on deck if they (or you) want to use protection.",2022-03-20 02:49:48,5

ti8bec,"Listen, we can be rejected for anything, right? Maybe political views or religious beliefs are too different, hobbies are too different, one might be a steak lover and the other vegan, one might love animals and the other's allergic. It can happen for any reason - that's what dating is for - to find people we mesh with. 

So maybe take some time to get to know people before disclosing, and if someone violates your trust, then deny. They'll look like the ass, not you. Or you could own it. Your call. 

Taking your antivirals every once in a while - I'm not sure what that means. If you want to reduce shedding, it has to be every day. 

Remember that every single person you meet has something they would rather not have to tell the person they are newly dating. Everyone. Yours is just a virus that 67% under 50 have. :)",2022-03-20 02:58:49,2
ti8bec,"I agree, with another comment here - maybe encourage your partner to get a full panel and exchange your results. Failing that, get to know them a bit better and then disclose.

I dont agree with what the other comment on here suggests about waiting to get hot and steamy and then disclosing - that to me sounds like a bad time to disclose.

ti8bec,"Hey! I legit just got diagnosed and am still dealing with my first outbreak, so I haven't disclosed to someone I want to have sex with right now yet, but I've told a lot of people, including people I slept with and people wanting to sleep with me.

Everyone has been really nice and talking about it has made me feel a lot better and a lot less like it's something bad or shameful. I think they key is to be matter of fact. Don't be outwardly nervous or acting like you're telling them something awful that you hope they can accept you for, cause that's not what's happening.

HSV1 is incredibly common. Your potential partner is more likely to have it than not and will certainly have been with others that had it whether they knew it or not. The only difference is that you're being open and communicating about it which is a good thing vs an embarrassing one. It's a sign of a partner who you can probably have great sex with since they are open and responsible.

GHSV1 is very unlikely to be transmittable even on days where you are shedding, which is apparently as low as 4 days a year. 

Just be mindful of if you are having an outbreak. If you want to be extra careful, my doctor said taking antivirals at least from 10 days before sex is best.

You might want to encourage them to get tested for HSV1 and HSV2 themselves. This is a two way street.",2022-03-20 01:09:28,1

My dating and sex life have not changed much since having the herp! If anything, it's made me more communicative and pickier about who I sleep with. I don't get outbreaks. I've disclosed to probably.....30 people or so and only 2 have ever cared.

ti8tus,"Hey hun. Take a moment to appreciate all the wonderful and beautiful things about you. Those are what matter. Herpes does not make someone ugly or untouchable. You are the same woman as before.. you just got a little something to deal with. And by little, I mean little. 
(From here on I’m calling it HSV because that’s what I prefer)

HSV is not this all the time outbreak you have to face. At the most it will pop up from on occasion and at the least it will only pop up a couple times in your life. It’s easy to live like it’s not even there. When you do have outbreaks... sure it’s uncomfortable and can make you sad. BUT you get through it. Life doesn’t stop because of some bumps. 

I’m 23, pregnant and happily with my boyfriend. We found out we had HSV-2 at the same time and decided it didn’t matter much. It’s taken me a couple years to really accept it but even back then I stayed optimistic and learned as much as I could about the virus and my body. It felt scary at first. But you will find that most people won’t ever know or need to know. And anyone you choose to tell will show you if they’re someone you want in life based on their reaction to you. You don’t want a man, friend or whatever that doesn’t accept and understand something trivial. And when you break it down HSV 1 or 2 are both silly little pains. We are part of nature and not immune to things like this. That’s okay. It’s just life. You 100% will go on to find so much love and enjoyment in life.



Here’s some facts that help me feel unbothered and secure in myself as a woman with HSV-2! 

- HSV-2 does not transmit to the mouth as easily as HSV-1 transmits to the genitals. 
- Unless you are having a time of viral shedding (causing high viral load) your chances of infecting someone else are very low.
- there are couples with one positive person and one negative and they don’t transmit.
- there are meds that help protect your partner from getting it. You take the anti-viral and it helps keep your viral load way down.
- condoms are a thing 
- HSV does not hurt your reproductive system.
- there are many options for how to manage it. 
- TONS of people have type 1, 2 or both. 
- other STIs should be taken more seriously than HSV. HSV gets a bad rep. HSV is not life threatening. But you know what can be? Chlamydia and gonorrhea! Yup those can kill you if left untreated. HSV cannot. It’s just a little irritating thing that happens sometimes.


Hope some of this helps! 

Remember you are more than your sex. But also your sex and love life is not over. It’s just different... which no matter what life will throw things at us to challenge our relationships with others and ourselves. Be confident! Knowledge is power

Your guilt is going to eat you up if you stay quiet… just explain your situation and tell her that the next day you felt symptoms.

ti86gw,"I can't lie and say I don't regret getting with the person that gave it to me but a lot of that is because I didn't even like them/feel attracted to them. I just felt like I needed to stop being prudish. After them I was with people I was more attracted to that I had better sex with using protection.

If I had liked the person and the experience, and was explained the situation as you did, I would understand and I wouldn't be that upset.

With ohsv1 being so common and you having had it so young, I understand why you didn't think about it. I always assumed I had it and never thought twice about it, the same goes for a lot of people. Turns out I didn't have it as a kid like I thought and contracted it now so I had nothing to disclose till recently, but I thought I did, I just never thought it mattered. It didn't even occur to me

Having my first outbreak and being diagnosed recently as an adult was a wake-up call for me that actually this is something I should be talking to people about.

You can ease her in with calling it a cold sore since I assume y’all won’t get sexual that quickly. There’s a good chance she gets cold sores too.

You shouldn’t be ashamed. HSV is common. It is not necessarily to tell friends unless someone you know will support you if you need. For partner/s, you can use anonymous messages services available for free by some websites when you can’t tell them directly. 
Usually, the first outbreak is a bit hard, but it will pass within a week. In case had more outbreaks during his/her life, it comes mild, and it has other triggers such as trauma, stress, or any issue that might reduce body immunity, so keep a healthy lifestyle, exercise, and protected sex. 
For now, I hope your doc prescribed antiviral medications, it might help to faster recovery even when you have already developed the symptoms. Also, get a spray reliever for itching and burning sensation

thxptv,"Comment removed due to misinformation. It is very well established that ghsv1 is far less contagious than both genital hsv2 and oral hsv1.

Studies haven't been conducted on actual transmission rates. But this can already be inferred by comparing asymptomatic shedding rates, which are known for all four type & location combinations, as well as the experiences of herpes experts and other STD experts who have worked in the field treating patients for multiple decades and say things such as:

...I would make is that genital to genital HSV1 transmission not only is ""somewhat"" uncommon. It appears to be very rare. In my 40+ years in the STD business, I have never seen a patient with newly acquired genital HSV1 who apparently acquired it by genital intercourse, only by receiving oral sex...

(Source: STD Expert H. Hunter Handsfield addressing Question #1238: ""HSV1 Genital-Transmission and Disclosure"" on the AskExpertsNow forum of the American Sexual Health Association)

And here's a quote from STD expert Edward W Hook on the same forum:

Genital HSV-1 is transmitted from infected partners far less often than genital HSV-2.  This is no doubt the result of several contributors including that clinical recurrences are less common with genital HSV-1 than for genital HSV-2 and because when people have genital HSV-1 they experience only about 20-25% of the amount of asymptomatic shedding of the virus that persons with genital HSV-2 do.  There are no recommendations on the potential benefit of chronic suppressive therapy for genital HSV-1, in part because the transmission is so uncommon that it is simply not a practical thing to study.  Does that mean that sexual transmission of GHSV-1 does not occur- of course not but it is quite uncommon.

Also note that more recent research has determined that genital hsv1 shedding frequency is actually even less than that stated above.

And here's a quote from herpes expert Terri Warren regarding genital-to-genital hsv1 transmission:

the likelihood that you would infect someone through intercourse is incredibly low.

(Source)

And another quote from Terri:

We actually have some great new information about genital HSV 1 infection based on a paper presented by Dr. Christine Johnson at the University of Washington, this past July.  Once a person has had genital HSV 1 for two years, based on her study, they only shed virus on 4 days out of an entire year.  That's why transmission through intercourse is so rare.  Now some people may shed virus more often and certainly some shed less, and there is more shedding quite early in the infection.  But that's the average after two years and as you can see it is very low indeed.  Based on her paper, I would say shedding at one year is probably around 4-5% of days, so 4-5 days out of 100 days, as an estimate.

(Source: Question #6376: ""To Dr. Handsfield"" on the AskExpertsNow forum of the American Sexual Health Association).

And in regard to the ghsv1 shedding frequency stated above, keep in mind that the vast majority of exposures to asymptomatic shedding do not result in transmission. Asymptomatic shedding makes transmission possible but it certainly doesn't guarantee it. Far more often than not, exposure to asymptomatic shedding doesn't result in transmission. So by 2 years in, there are only 4 days on average, per year, when there would be any risk at all, and even on those days the risk would still be low.

Dr. Hunter Handsfield has been quoted as saying that for folks with gHSV1, if you do not have a second outbreak within your first year of infection, then there is an 88% chance that you will never again have another outbreak. On the other hand, I have seen folks in this sub say that they have had multiple and frequent outbreaks with gHSV1. There is going to be variation from person to person, since all of our bodies react to viruses differently.

thxptv,"I'm not gonna speak to an experience I haven't had, but I do know the stigma is greater, so I recognize how that could make it a lot more difficult for people to deal with. 

I can see how my post could be dismissive of people that really struggle with the stigma. It's not something to downplay, you're right. It's a really hard thing to deal with and even though I have found the pain more difficult, the stigma has affected me to some extent.

 Ive been trying to be really positive and not let this define me or let others define me by this. Even with hsv1 I've found it difficult as while I know it's really common, not a single person I've spoken to has shared they have it too. I can read the stats but if I don't see it in real life around me it feeds the voice in my head that's telling that I'm all the negative ideas that come with having an STD.

I can be confident talking to people but I'm still kinda desperately thinking ""yeah you can be nice to me but would now think of me as someone you wouldn't want to sleep with?"" I just am doing my best to shut that voice down.

I've tried to see the silver linings, and most of those apply to hsv2. For example, now any partners I have sexually will have been people that have been able to have good enough open communication with me that we've been able to navigate this conversation comfortably and with care. I think that will only be a good thing. I don't need everyone to want me, just the right people, and this is a good test of that in a way. I'm also a lot more knowledgeable about STDs now. I used to be ignorant and would have made judgements that I now see are wrong and I feel better as a person for having had the opportunity to change and grow in this capacity.

So yeah the experiences are different. The stigma is different. I can't speak to what it's like to deal with. But I can say most of what I have been using to cope with this change are things that would apply to people with either virus.",2022-03-20 00:48:48,1

thxptv,"I was very recently diagnosed and my first outbreak was the worst experience I’ve ever had. I figured out how to best manage the pain for myself though. I was taking antivirals as prescribed by my doc and then some pain meds as well. Initially anything touching the area hurt. I would shower and try to clean the area (just with water) as best I could, I actually turned the shower to cold to rinse the area because it kind of numbed the stinging a bit. Then gently pat it dry (with a seperate towel). I put a numbing gel on the sores (lidocaine/lignocaine) 2-3 times a day and that would help. I was also sitting on ice packs a few hours a day if it got really bad. The pain was from stinging but then also like an aching in my butt and legs. The painkillers did help with that when I would take them regularly.

All in all, this is my first outbreak so I can’t speak to anything going forward but it was absolute hell for a couple of days and then it eased a bit when I figured out my own routine of handling it. I know it might be hard to ‘see the light at the end of the tunnel’ but it will pass and you will be ok.",2022-03-20 02:40:02,1

thq1w9,"I felt very, very similar to this when I found out just over a year ago. I’m a woman and I found out I had it while with someone who did not. I honestly didn’t want to live either. I also have a troubled upbringing and very bad depression. It didn’t work out with that guy but for other reasons. 

The next guy I met had genital HSV-2 and I have genital HSV-1. He had it much longer than I did and really coached me through life with it. I didn’t see out another “infected” but it was just luck I suppose. He told me that it is a bit harder to have connections with women but believe me, he’s far from celibate. He’s not unbelievably good looking but he’s an average guy with a decent cute face, ya know. That didn’t work out for us but he’s happily in a relationship now with someone without herpes. I also know quite a few women in relationships with herpes positive men. 

What I’m trying to convey is that everything seems worse in the beginning. It is SO hard. But it gets better I promise. You’ll get the occasional person who shoots you down or ghosts you or says something terribly mean but your skin gets thicker. You are not your disease. You deserve love and happiness and everything anyone else does. Take it day by day. I know even unrelated issues in life seem worse currently, that’s how I felt. I already had this, this, and this wrong AND NOW I HAVE HERPES?! What did I do to deserve this? Or why me? Can I not get a break? But it will get better as cliche as that is to say and as much as it’s probably not so helpful to you currently. Try seeking out therapy or psychiatry depending on what else in going on in your life. A positive attitude and mindset will change your whole world. And just always try to remember… YOU ARE NOT YOUR DISEASE. I hope you find peace with your diagnosis soon my friend.

I’ve been with a handful of people since then & as far as I know I haven’t passed it on to anybody, but I do take daily antivirals so that lowers the risk. I dealt with one negative reaction from a man who was the first person I tried to date after my diagnosis but my first actual boyfriend after I was diagnosed also had HSV1, nobody I’ve been with after him had it but everyone has been ok with it. I still have a really hard time talking about it with someone I hope to be with. Rejection is scary. I’m a woman & I’ve also heard it’s easier for women than for men but the way I see it, it’s so common & even if you aren’t able to be with someone who’s HSV negative (which I don’t think is realistic but I understand that feeling), you’ll run into someone who’s HSV positive sooner or later. The worst part about this is the stigma but you’re not alone. Hope things get easier for you.

Edit: just wanted to add, I’ve ALWAYS disclosed & never been intimate with anybody if I even THINK I may be having an outbreak, & as far as I know I haven’t passed it on to anybody I’ve been with who is HSV negative… & condoms also weren’t always used.

No need to belittle someone because you don’t agree with how they react towards their own situation. We’re all here for some sort of support after all.",2022-03-20 00:53:00,2

Most ,however live in ignorant bliss bc they've never been tested and are asymptomatic or symptoms are so mild they mistake it for a pimple or rash or razor burn. Do not let this get you down. I hate that I wasted any time feeling sad over a super common, non life threatening skin blister. There are SO many diseases  that are MUCH worse .

thkoco,"Hi, herpes is a really common thing 1 in 10 people have hsv 2 and alot more have hsv 1 and it does not cause any health complications unless your immune system is really compromised. Herpes increases the risk to contact HIV and females already have a higher risk of contracting any std then men. It is a skin desease and people just asume its really bad due to the advertisement of the pharmaceutical companies.Altho the ob can be uneasy to look at and can cause discomfort usually they become less painful and much less often over time. You cannot spread the virus thru toilet seats etc as the virus cannot survive longer outside a living body but can be passed if you share lipsticks, share food with same spoon or share towels etc for hsv1 and for hsv 2 direct skin to skin contact or sharing towels. your family members are really less likely to contract hsv from you, but take extra precautions during obs rest they even dont need to know you have it. And most people with hsv have a active sexual life with patner who donot have it and they dont pass it on. So no need to giveup on anything or let anyone tell you othewise cause you got this Just take meds as prescribed by ur doc!
Plus im a man and 22 i got hsv when i was 21 by a girl i am not saying fuck all girls so stay positive cuz thats the only key if you stress yourself it can be a cause of a ob, i mean it is what it is plus with medication use black seed oil i just started using it after i read a finding that it can deactivate hsv1 it did not mention hsv2 but i think it works the same but the oil cannot eliminate the virus!

thkoco,"Omg thank you for that! I feel lost in all the information. The web can be great, but sifting through for good articles when you don’t know what you’re looking for… thanks for pointing me in the right direction!! 

I hope your sex is amazing! And thanks for giving me hope :) I’m crying",2022-03-19 02:34:53,4
thkoco,"That’s true. I think I’m just in the denial angry whatever stage. Not entirely sure yet. I really am glad i found this Reddit and there are people like you to help and talk about it. I feel better knowing you’re 22. Hearing everyone talk about their sexual experiences gives me hope my life won’t be completely fucked up later. 

I’m not even worried about *sex* right now it’s just the idea that like sex is what normal people do and I’m worried so terribly about disclosure and everything. I don’t handle rejection well, so this will be a new battle in the future. Again, I’m so not worried about it right now… just saying it all scares me. 

Every minute of the day i think about every scenario ever in my life. Past and present and future. I keep replaying getting my diagnosis (I have PTSD so the replay button in my brain is used to doing it) and I am thinking about my future every possible instance this will effect. 

I’m just trying to… I don’t know. Get comfortable. I think if I wasn’t in the middle of a horrible disgusting outbreak I would feel better. Well, I have the rest of my life to work on that haha so. 

You are right too, I should not say fuck all men. I am really upset with this person because he is not understanding the gravity of it. Not even the basic science “how do you know it won’t go away”…. Buddy. Cmon.",2022-03-19 03:17:01,4

thkoco,"To make sure you have the correct Herpes Handbook, [it's here](https://westoverheights.com/herpes/the-updated-herpes-handbook/). 

Your doctor sucks, and you should find a new one. 

&#x200B;

>Anyways, she told me that if i sit down in the shower with my lesions and then my sister goes to take a shower later and sits down that she will contract it if i don’t clean the tub.

NO. The only way you'll transmit it to anyone in your house is if you have unclothed, genital to genital contact with them. 

&#x200B;

>She basically scared me into never having anything touch the lesions that will touch elsewhere. I have been self in wearing gloves when I wipe when I pee and gloves when I put lidocaine on the sores. I’m just so scared of spreading it.

Gloves aren't a horrible idea when you have the first outbreak, because your skin is just so open and raw, and touching it can introduce other bacteria into it, and no one wants that. 

As u/HappyArtichoke111 already said, once you get antibodies, spreading it to other areas is really not a concern. The only areas you have to be concerned with now are your mouth, nose and eyes - mucus membranes. 

You don't need to swear off sex forever. I understand the sentiment, but don't even worry about that right now. The Handbook has a bunch of transmission info, should you decide to give men another chance lol, but that can come later. I'm sure sex isn't on your To Do list right now. 

Don't beat yourself up. If you got covid or strep, or something, would you be this angry with yourself? Getting herpes isn't a personal failure. It's literally just a virus. 

I'm glad you got the lidocaine. If your doctor gave you that, that's about the only thing I like. 

The blood tests - do you know what they were? It should be an IgG type specific. The Handbook explains the IgM. I bet money that's what your doctor ordered, and those suck.

My beef is with the medical community that dont test for hsv2 in the standard checkup. You would think that testing for an STD that cant be cured would be a top priority but no.

But the risk of stds, especially herpes because of the stigma, bothers me a lot. I just feel like I don’t really have much sexual experience to settle down with a girl.

I think you are bound to have herpes if you have sex with multiple partners throughout your life even if you use condoms. It doesn’t lower the risk much. So would you still do it? or would you rather live a mostly celibate life as long as you don’t catch herpes?

Guess what that can be genital too. 

Up to 90% of hsv2 posistive people are unaware they have it because they are asymptomatic. Women have double, yes twice as likely to contract it. So on top of bleeding once a month and constant fluctuating hormones that we live with, you men once again get it easier in the sense you only have a 10% chance of catching hsv2 from your female partner over the year. If she's taking daily antivirals that gets cut in half. Women are also more likely to have flares and be symptomatic... every month our periods can trigger an out break because our hormones are all over the place.

Since I don't have symptoms, it's easy for me to say that it was worth it. I'm sure others would respond differently. I would not want to live a life of abstinence after experiencing the joy from intimacy and sex.",2022-03-18 21:17:59,1

If you're not having outbreaks, there's not a lot of need for anything other than Valtrex to reduce transmission. Studies are mixed, at best, at what lysine does for herpes, though some swear by it, but if it does anything, it reduces outbreaks. It does nothing for transmission. 

Women are often low in vit D, so I won't say anything about that lol, and I haven't heard much about the B100 and herpes. None of it reduces transmission - only valtrex does that. Supplements don't. 

If they make you feel better, then by all means, take them. If it's ever a matter of finances, and you're wondering what matters most, the Valtrex does, since you don't have outbreaks, if your goal is transmission reduction.",2022-03-19 03:26:38,1

The stigma bothers me not because of my own judgments about it but the judgements of others. Seeing how many people in Reddit respond badly to hsv2 diagnosis. 

I wouldn’t have a problem dating someone with hsv2 or hsv1 in their genitals even if they chose not to tell me about it due to the stigma, as long as they were being careful about it. Like taking antivirals or at least not having sex with me when they have an open sore. I do hope though that at some point they would tell me about it.

Herpes isn't a punishment for being sexually active. It's not a ""price you pay"" for anything. Illnesses are not karmic justice, and this statement implies that she might not have herpes had she not had so many partners. 

&#x200B;

>I think you are bound to have herpes if you have sex with multiple partners throughout your life even if you use condoms.

Not really. Some of it is luck of the draw, some of it is asking for test results, etc. Condoms also offer significant protection against herpes. 

I was promiscuous in my younger years. I got herpes in a long term, serious relationship in my 30s. I knew he had it, and took the risk. I didn't get it when I was having multiple sex partners and not using condoms a lot because I was on the pill. 

Some of our members got herpes the first time they had sex, from an assault, or because they've had a varied sex life.

Well the statistics are that about 1 in 6 people have hsv2. And that’s the people that presumably have been diagnosed with it and that about 80% of people have it but don’t know. So that means the number must be much higher and it skews toward the older population who have had more sexual partners. Therefore say you are 30. And suppose we assume that the real prevalence of the disease is 1 in 6. If you’ve had sexual encounters with 6 different people, there’s a very high chance you’ve been exposed to it.

Describing catching an incurable disease as a price worth paying for taking a specific risk is just a manner of speech that does not convey any moral judgement.

I work in finance and I have to measure everything as a risk/reward trade off. You pay a price to take a bet with positive expected value. 

I could’ve asked if she thought having multiple sexual partners was a positive expected value trade given the risk of herpes but I think she would’ve been much more confused.

“Some of it is luck of the draw”

True that’s due to variance. You could just be very unlucky and catch herpes on your first sexual encounter or the opposite, never catch herpes. I don’t disagree with that. But I’m referring to the statistical certainty you’ll acquire herpes the more sexual partners you have due to the prevalence of the disease among the general population. If 1 in 6 people have herpes then assuming you’ve had more than six different sexual partners then there’s a very high probability you’ve already been exposed to it.

My risk/reward trade off paid off. Yes, I got herpes, but even though the relationship didn't work, I got other things out of the relationship that I'll value forever. 

Your formula is off, because you aren't factoring in things like condoms, transmission rates, antivirals, etc. Did you know that if a male is in a relationship with a female who has hsv2, and all they do is avoid sex during an outbreak, there is a 4% chance of transmission per year?

Didn’t have sex this whole time until this last sexual encounter and it was unprotected sex. The woman wants to keep having unprotected sex but I’m hesitant about it due to the prevalence of the disease. Hence I’m wondering about the risks and if I’m just being overly paranoid.

But you choose to see the words I’m using as claiming that her behavior is morally bad simply because I described one outcome as a cost. Which is a fair way to describe it since the op seems to prefer to not have herpes. Therefore seeing the passing of moral judgement in describing a herpes infection as a cost has more to do with your own moral opinions about casual sex than mine.

I didn’t ask you that question because well you are not the op and I was originally talking to the op lol. Our conversation is whether I am slut shaming op or not. Which I don’t think I am nor have intention to.

Ps: I don’t think engaging in consensual casual sex with multiple partners throughout life is a morally reprehensible behavior itself. It just carries certain health risks. It’s like saying not sleeping enough or not eating healthy.

I do wonder if I’ve had those same outbreaks years ago and dismissed them as a pimple simply because I had always used a condom therefore thought I was safe from herpes.

Test together? Lol no that’s not going to happen. It’s a complicated situation. I think I’ll just try to avoid her and maybe get a regular girl with whom I can do that just to be less susceptible to her seduction.",2022-03-19 20:16:46,1

thp8wj,Yeah I’ve had them since I was a kid and it’s only on my lips. I have gotten them before near my eyes when I got a really bad sunburn. When I got them near my eyes I had to keep my eyes shut like two weeks because they were on my eyelids but eventually they went away. But yes I’ve had them since I was a kid.,2022-03-21 16:39:36,1
thp8wj,"Okay, that’s it then. Just a case of cold sores. I’m sorry they reach your eyes, maybe get on antivirals if that becomes a problem in your later years . It’s still herpes though, so you’ll have to avoid oral sex, kissing during outbreaks. I would disclose to partners, but pretty much nobody does for hsv1 Oral(they should tho 
lmao ghsv1 is skyrocketing) so it’s your moral choice. Your antibody count is so high I doubt you’ll see many cold sores again though.",2022-03-21 17:32:46,1

th6r48,"I'm older, but have lived a long time with this virus. 

It isn't going to ruin anything unless you let it. I promise.

If you are feeling depressed, feel like dropping out of school (omg, please don't do that if herpes has any factor in this decision - maybe change your major or something?), like you can't go on, then get counseling. I get that your generation looks to your peers for help, but when you are struggling this much, it's time for actual professional help. 

Herpes doesn't bring your value down (and I don't know who gave your generation this whole value as a person crap, but I hate it so much), because you just have value. You aren't worth more because you don't have herpes, or because you have accomplished such and such, or whatever. (I feel like my generation failed you somewhere, and I'm sorry.) 

You can still have whatever it is you want in life. It has been the smallest blip in my life. I got it in my 30s, and I swear to you, it doesn't even work to repel the drunk guys in bars that you don't want near you. Half of them have it too, and the other half don't care. 

My experience, of course, isn't the same as yours because I was older when I got it, but a good friend of mine got it when we were in high school, our junior year. We ended up at the same college, and she dated, found her guy, got married, and has kids. 

Other people I've met since - and there are many - that have herpes, all have really ""normal"" lives. They get married, and divorced, have gone to college, or not, had kids if they wanted to, etc etc. It's all just the same as everyone else. 

Herpes doesn't have to have a depression aspect. If it does, get help for that. Depression is it's own issue, and you should treat it that way. 

You all are still so worthy. 💖",2022-03-19 02:37:12,3

thjlh4,"Do you mean sex work when you say ""certain type of job""? And do you mean sexually promiscuous when you say ""certain type of lifestyle""? 

I mean, I don't know that anyone has ever thought I was a sex worker when I said I had herpes, but I'm sure some people automatically think people have had a lot of sex partners. I laugh, because I got it in my 30s, in a long term serious relationship, long after my wilder, more promiscuous days were over. 

Some people just think sex is ""dirty"" and having any sex outside marriage means you set yourself up for an STI. 

Maybe if you elaborate on what you mean, and why you are asking, we can help more.",2022-03-19 01:38:44,3
thjlh4,Sorry maybe I wrote too much,2022-03-19 01:58:52,1
thjlh4,"I found out via searching for a cure on internet and by having seen some comments on Reddit that people who are hsv positive have the type of life that you mentioned, yes and are into drugs. I’m desperate this herpes has caused so many problems in my health physical and mental that I don’t see the point of continuing living like this, I never had the chance to have a complete good relationship and have caught this virus in a long term relationship but with someone who was not serious about our relationship and who treated me really badly but I couldn’t react as I was always ill. 
I feel like I lost everything. I couldn’t finish high school since I had a difficult situation in my teens, my brothers passed away one after the other and I guess that I needed physiological help, I couldn’t study so I left school and went to work. I build up 20 years of career in tourism and in the hotel industry and I was successful until I met this man who I thought was maybe a good person to get married with. Long story short the relationship hardly lasted 3 and a half years with many difficulties all to damage my person, I lost my job and had to leave the country were I lived for 27 years to go back to my original country where is super difficult to integrate and find a job and in any case I always wanted to finish school so I went back to school I passed the 3rd year and now I’m at my 4th and I have exams soon but I can’t concentrate I’m in a terrible state of mind I had a huge OB 2 days ago and I’m tired, tired of all of this agony, tired of having to hide from people because I know that they would just walk away from me for having this horrible virus.. I’m so lost, if it wasn’t for my parents I don’t know what I’d do but this isn’t life, maybe the only thing that it’s keeping me a part from my parents it’s the fact that I’m Catholic and I don’t want to go to hell but I’d want to end up in peace with my relatives (I know that this might sound stupid or childish to some people). This man destroyed my health at the age of 35 and now I’m 42 (not all people at the age of 42 are mature like you may think I should be as been this age, I lived in a Muslim country and the mentality is very different than the one of people who lived in Europe or USA even if I not an Arab. The last 3 years have been very hard mentally wise but also physically as this virus gave me so many problems….",2022-03-19 01:58:40,0
thjlh4,"Okay, so first, I'm sorry you have to go through all this, but people with herpes are just like everyone else - some have a lot of partners, some are into drugs, some have never touched drugs, or had alcohol. Some are very religious, some aren't. 

They are people who got a virus. The mode of transmission is sex. 

We have everyone in this forum from students to people with advanced degrees, from people who work at restaurants to corporate executives and technology experts and every single thing in between. Some are single, some are in relationships, some are married. Some have kids, some don't. Some are wealthy, probably, some aren't, probably. I think I've seen just about every race, religion, ethnicity, creed, several nationalities, gender identity, sexuality. 

Some people got herpes from their very first sexual experience. Some got it from being assaulted or abused. 

Don't let the stigma get to you - none of it is true. 

What you can do now is absolutely take care of you. Finish your schooling. Get some counseling. Anytime you wonder if it's worth it, it's time for counseling. You aren't the only person in your country with herpes - every country has it. See if you can get on suppression, like daily Valtrex. 

For your outbreak pain, get something with lidocaine in it, or lidocaine ointment. I don't know what's in your country, but ask a doctor. 

You have given men so much of you - don't let them have any more. Start living for you. I'm older than you are and know that some men at 42 - and 52 - aren't fully mature. Don't worry about that. Just work on you. You had a great career for a long time, and have experienced different parts of the world - you know you can be successful. You know you are smart. You can be successful now, and again. 

Once you heal from the past, then worry about the future, but for now, do YOU. Herpes is just one little itty bitty part of you. Don't let it be more than that. :) You are still wonderful.",2022-03-19 02:24:32,5

That is not typical of herpes. Most symptoms would not last that long.

Equally a cyst in the urethra does not sound like herpes, neither does erectile dysfunction.

th0x8p,"It's the same virus, you are still contagious and you still have this for life, you should still disclose to partners and you should still take precautions when having sex to limit the risk of transmission. But there are some big differences. I am unsure why so many comments here are saying there is not much difference - there is.

Hsv1 does not like to live on the genitals. Outbreaks are less severe and studies have shown that shedding is far less frequent than genital hsv2 or oral hsv1. If you are not shedding the virus, and the virus is not present on the skin, you are at no risk of transmitting the virus. Which means having a strain in a location in which it sheds the least, is advantageous if you are concerned with reducing transmission risk.

For you, this means you have the ""preferable"" kind of hsv - the one that is least likely to transmit to partners. Terri Warren an expert at Westover Heights Clinic has over 35 years of experience with herpes and has never seen someone transmited genital hsv1 from the genitals of someone else. This means that genital hsv1 is almost exclusively caused by the carrier of oral hsv1 performing oral sex on them. Oral hsv 2, which is quite rare, sheds even less at 1% of the days evaluated.

One study found that after 2 years of infection with genital hsv1, the rates of asymptomatic/symptomatic shedding dropped massively. In another study, genital hsv1 shedded on 3-5% of the days evaluated, versus 15-30% for genital hsv2. Thats a pretty massive difference. 

We know that for hsv2, if you take daily valtrex you can cut this shedding down even further, by about 50%. And if you then use condoms ontop of this every time you have sex, your liklihood of transmission is extremely low. Keep in mind that these stats are based on hsv2, not hsv1, and since genital hsv1 is known to shed less, these numbers are probably even more favourable in the case of genital hsv1.

Once your immune system gets used to this virus, people with hsv1 genitally typically have far less outbreaks and they tend to be far less severe, though early infection can still be rough.

All this information is available via the free downloadable ""Herpes Handbook"" from the Westover Heights Clinic.

Even though you are statistically less likely to spread the virus, please consider the importance of disclosure. At the end of the day, herpes is herpes.",2022-03-18 17:20:24,20
th0x8p,"HSV1 is typically in the mouth (coldsores/crankers) and HSV2 is typically in the genital area (STI). It not uncommon for HSV1 to be found on the gential or vise versa.

This most likely means that whoever gave you genital HSV1 had a coldsore and gave you head. My doctor said that is you have HSV1 in the genital area its less serve as having HSV2 in the genital area. 

""The herpes simplex virus (HSV) is categorized into 2 types: HSV-1 and HSV-2.

th0x8p,"Comment removed due to misinformation. It is very well established that ghsv1 is *far* less contagious than both genital hsv2 and oral hsv1.

Studies haven't been conducted on actual transmission rates. But this can already be inferred by comparing asymptomatic shedding rates, which *are* known for all four type & location combinations, as well as the experiences of herpes experts and other STD experts who have worked in the field treating patients for multiple decades and say things such as:

>...I would make is that genital to genital HSV1 transmission not only is ""somewhat"" uncommon. It appears to be very rare. In my 40+ years in the STD business, I have never seen a patient with newly acquired genital HSV1 who apparently acquired it by genital intercourse, only by receiving oral sex...

(Source: STD Expert H. Hunter Handsfield addressing Question #1238: ""HSV1 Genital-Transmission and Disclosure"" on the [AskExpertsNow](https://www.askexpertsnow.com/) forum of the [American Sexual Health Association](https://www.ashasexualhealth.org/))

And here's a quote from STD expert Edward W Hook on the same forum:

>Genital HSV-1 is transmitted from infected partners far less often than genital HSV-2.  This is no doubt the result of several contributors including that clinical recurrences are less common with genital HSV-1 than for genital HSV-2 and because when people have genital HSV-1 they experience only about 20-25% of the amount of asymptomatic shedding of the virus that persons with genital HSV-2 do.  There are no recommendations on the potential benefit of chronic suppressive therapy for genital HSV-1, in part because the transmission is so uncommon that it is simply not a practical thing to study.  Does that mean that sexual transmission of GHSV-1 does not occur- of course not but it is quite uncommon.

Also note that more recent research has determined that genital hsv1 shedding frequency is actually even *less* than that stated above.

And here's a quote from herpes expert Terri Warren regarding genital-to-genital hsv1 transmission:

>the likelihood that you would infect someone through intercourse is incredibly low. 

([Source](https://westoverheights.com/forum/question/i-want-to-understand-more-about-ghsv-1/))

And another quote from Terri:

>We actually have some great new information about genital HSV 1 infection based on a paper presented by Dr. Christine Johnson at the University of Washington, this past July.  Once a person has had genital HSV 1 for two years, based on her study, they only shed virus on 4 days out of an entire year.  That's why transmission through intercourse is so rare.  Now some people may shed virus more often and certainly some shed less, and there is more shedding quite early in the infection.  But that's the average after two years and as you can see it is very low indeed.  Based on her paper, I would say shedding at one year is probably around 4-5% of days, so 4-5 days out of 100 days, as an estimate.

(Source: Question #6376: ""To Dr. Handsfield"" on the [AskExpertsNow](https://www.askexpertsnow.com/) forum of the [American Sexual Health Association](https://www.ashasexualhealth.org/)).

And in regard to the ghsv1 shedding frequency stated above, keep in mind that the vast majority of exposures to asymptomatic shedding do *not* result in transmission. Asymptomatic shedding makes transmission *possible* but it certainly *doesn't* guarantee it. Far more often than not, exposure to asymptomatic shedding *doesn't* result in transmission. So by 2 years in, there are only 4 days on average, per year, when there would be any risk at all, and even on those days the risk would still be low.",2022-03-18 19:25:11,2

If you have herpes symptoms then these should not be ignored. A swab is very accurate but only if done in good time.

thcz8c,"That seems to be the case from all of my research but that's what's even more irritating to be honest. With so many groups working towards a vaccine, you'd think that there would have been a study on time correlation so they have a base line to measure how their vaccines would work on someone who is newly diagnosed vs someone who has had it for years. Im actually perplexed how there hasn't been a study about length of having it but since it's not something that's life threatening I guess that study is at the bottom of importance.

Knowing that several potential vaccines are kinda in the pipe line, maybe that study will happen but honestly that's a study I would have thought some medical journal or school would have done by now for some basic research and publishing reasons",2022-03-18 19:40:27,1

Easiest piece of mind is to go get tested at your doctor or a walk in clinic. If something they can swab, they will. If not, then you'll have to wait several weeks to get an accurate blood test.

th92k8,Sounds like UTI from dirty fingers. It can take up to 3 months to test positive for HSV. I haven't had any symptoms and it came up on my regular exam.,2022-03-18 18:39:42,1
th92k8,"Hi there :) and I’ve been there before! I think the most important thing you can do is go and get tested. Be completely upfront with your symptoms to the doctor. Ask the doctor EXACTLY what they are testing you for. Idk if stds are just too taboo in society, but doctors/nurses have a tendency to be very vague. Sometimes they use lingo like “youre clean” or “your tests are negative”, but they don’t say what tests you were negative for. Another thing to keep in mind in incubation periods. Let’s say you have sex with someone who has chlamydia and doesn’t know they have it. You go to the STD clinic a couple days later because you feel anxious about it all. You could still have a negative result, because chlamydia takes 7-14 days (typically, it could take longer) to show up. I’d also be careful taking meds for chlamydia/gonorrhea if you didn’t get a positive test for either of them. Antibiotic resistance is real, so it’s important to only take meds if you have a confirmed diagnoses. Another thing to consider is most docs do not perform herpes testing unless you have a bump somewhere. You could also ask for a HSV blood test, buuuut that just shows if you’ve ever been exposed (and most people have), but it doesn’t confirm if you’re having a breakout- only a swab of an active bump can do that. Another thing to think about could be that the lesions are hidden. If you have a vagina, it could be on the inside of your vagina. Sometimes it can be on the inside of your anus. Frequent urination has been linked to chlamydia/gonorrhea. It could also be a UTI. I use to get utis a lot from having sex with an old partner. Another thing I will say is that I’ve been there. Sometimes when I would have sex with someone, after I’d be so paranoid that something is wrong down there. I’m at the point now where I just have to listen more to my body. Sometimes my mind makes symptoms seem worse than they actually are. Sometimes my mind makes symptoms up if I’m paranoid enough. There’s no harm in getting testing though if you truly feel symptoms. Get better:)) sending you good vibes",2022-03-18 19:09:29,1

Skeptical about it like I am with everything I try, I decided to give it a go 5 months ago and bought a 3 month supply to see if it would help.

I noticed halfway through month #2 that the lymph node on the left side of my groin was gone(no swelling), after discovering this I ordered another 3 month supply, they accidentally sent me 6 months lol, which I'll happily take. April 3 with will be 6 months on the program and I have had no outbreaks, no pain, no itching etc. Nothing, so I will say it's a success thus far, never went this long without an OB and I'm super happy my lympy node for the first time in 8 years isn't swollen. I would say give it a try, BUT you have to be consistent in taking it, don't miss a dose, you take two pills a day, one in morning one at night, hope this helps someone, as it has helped me thus far, it has a 60 day money back guarantee which is why I took a chance with it, glad I did",2022-03-19 20:16:28,2

Basically if you're having a one night stand type situation, there isn't really a need to disclose G-HSV1, as the transmission/shed rates are extremely low and you can take an antiviral/use protection on top of that. Hsv-1 does not thrive in the genitals and it is much harder to transmit from that area than orally. Now if you're getting into a continued sexual relationship with someone, you should probably disclose it to them but again, it GHSV-1 transmission rates are EXTREMELY low. Again, this is what two doctors told me.",2022-03-18 02:42:05,6
tgqt5t,"Ok so I’ve had ghsv-1 for 9 years. So I’ll tell you about my experience. Ghsv-1 is known for having a lower genital to genital tranmission rate then ghsv-2 . Also anyone who has cold sores is immune to your herpes because 99% of all cold sores are hsv-1.  So with both types of herpes transmission rate is less from female to male and it is also much less if you do not have an outbreak basically with no outbreak GHSv-1 and being a female your transmission rate is around 1% if that. There isn’t much of a difference between the two other than that they look the same when having an outbreak. There is a running theory that people with GHSV one have less outbreaks and that was true for me overtime. I never was on any medication I never took any supplements and after around 2 to 3 years I stopped having outbreaks altogether. I went around five years with no outbreaks until I got Covid and then my streak was broken. I am a firm advocate for disclosing every time all the time if someone has a weak immune System herpes can affect them way worse than someone with a regular immune system and I’m also a huge advocate of informed consent and having a choice. I have disclosed over 25 times and had very minimal rejections and a lot of success. (I’ll attach a disclosure guide) and the dr was so nonchalant because 1 in 6 people ages 14-49 have genital herpes, 50-80% of the population has hsv-1 and 60% of new genital herpes cases are hsv-1 so you are very far from alone.

tgqt5t,"Let's hope I don't miss anything.

Usually, HSV-1 is oral, and HSV-2 is genital. However, it doesn't mean the one type can't cause an outbreak in the other area though.

Depending on your source, 2/3 of people have HSV 1 and/or 2.

Yes, it's something you can transmit even if there are no outbreaks. If you do have an outbreak, you can go see or potentially even call a doctor, and they'll prescribe you a (10 day for the first time, 2-4 days for subsequent times) dose of either Valacyclovir or Acyclovir. (They're both practically the same.)

Generally, people with HSV don't have a lot to worry about. We've all been where you are. You first find out, have to leave work because you're so distraught, or spend the next few days crying yourself to sleep because you're worried you'll never get anyone to like you again. You'll get better. You have to. Every single one of the people in this sub has sympathy for you, and the only thing we can do for now is help each other through it. 

However, there is a team of researchers working on a cure for herpes. they're making progress every day, and they're on track to have a completed cure within the next 4-5 years. keep an eye on the news and we'll eagerly await the cure together.",2022-03-18 03:01:02,2

If you wanna give me your email or some other way to send you documents, let me know. They were really helpful to me. I also found this handbook helpful. On page 15 and 16 it talks about shedding rates (with caveat that most people in study have been together long term already/ie long term exposure has already occurred). https://westoverheights.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Updated-Herpes-Book.pdf",2022-03-18 04:09:16,2

I’m wondering … I first was exposed and diagnosed around end of February 2021… my outbreak was terrible and I was sick with fever then cough then breakouts for 6 weeks. I thought I was in the clear after April when I didn’t have a break out again. Then a couple of days ago I started to feel itch and pain down there around same area. I started on meds again and it’s sort of under control but still painful. I don’t see sores yes but it feels like skin ripping and there’s a bump underneath skin. Is this another outbreak? Should I just expect them once a year? I want to cry I was doing well mentally hopefully I’d never have one again :((( I hope at most it’s once a year. It’s just so painful.

tguujz,"Hiiii there!:) I’ve also got the gift that keeps giving. I think one of the things that has been hard to come to terms with for me is trying to pin down how it happened and who gave it to me. It’s a VERRRY grey area. Typically it takes 2-20 days for an initial outbreak to occur, but sometimes it can take YEARS for one to occur. Sometimes the symptoms are so mild that people do not notice them, so they don’t get tested. And when doctors say they’ll give you a “full std panel” they typically leave out herpes testing. Lots of times people get a “full std panel”, get a call back from the nurse saying they’re negative (very vague, I know), and boom.. they think they’re 110% clean. But that’s just not the case. I think at the end of the day, STDs are very grey and complicated. And how our society treats stds and grey and complicated. I think I’ve learned that when I have sex with someone, it’s a trust fall. Even if you try to cover all of your bases by asking for test results, the partner could of gotten tested too early for the std to show in their system. It’s all about weighing your risks here.

tgxi4d,"Do you now which *type* of genital herpes she has? It can be either hsv1 or hsv2. Of the two, genital hsv2 poses a higher transmission risk. But even for genital hsv2, with precautions the risk can be brought down very low. Here are the stats for female-to-male genital hsv2 transmission within the constraints stated:

---

**Female-to-Male ghsv2 transmission:**

In studies of couples in long term relationships (ie together at least 3 months already) where the woman has genital hsv2 and the man doesn't and they both know she has it, if they have unprotected sex for an entire year (approximately twice per week) except during outbreaks and the woman takes no herpes medication, the man has a 4% chance of becoming infected by the end of the year.

Having sex more or less often than twice per week would raise or lower that base figure accordingly. Also note that that base figure comes from studies of couples already in long term relationships, and herpes is slightly more likely to transmit when the partners have been together less than 3 months. We aren't sure exactly *how* much higher the risk is before the 3-month mark, but we know its definitely higher. Herpes is also known to be more active when the infection is recent, most notably during the first 6-12 months of having it (the decline is gradual).

Condom use and herpes medication would each lower the female-to-male transmission risk by about 50% further from whatever it was before. So if the couple uses condoms *or* the woman takes medication, the annual risk to the man comes down to about 2%. And if they use both, it comes down to about 1%.

---

Again, the above stats are for genital hsv2. The risk posed by genital hsv1 would be at least several times *less*. Genital hsv1 is one of the least active kinds of herpes there is and poses considerably less risk of transmission than not only genital hsv2 but also oral hsv1. You'd actually be considerably *safer*, ie considerably less likely of catching oral hsv1 or genital hsv1 from a partner who has genital hsv1 than you would be from a partner who has oral hsv1 -- which more than half the population has. And that's presuming you don't already have oral hsv1 yourself. If you do then you'd be at no practical risk of catching hsv1 genitally -- you'd already have hsv1 antibodies due to your oral infection.

Note that if your partner has genital hsv2 and isn't already taking daily suppressive herpes medication, it would be entirely reasonable for you to ask or even *require* that she go on it in order to reduce the transmission risk to you. Suppressive herpes medication is safe, poses no health risks for even very long term use, is affordable for the vast majority of people, doesn't detract from the sexual experience at all, and would reduce transmission risk to you by about an additional 50% from whatever it was before (which would depend on whether you're using condoms).",2022-03-18 10:15:14,2

This is unclear. Which test came back positive for hsv1? Your swab test or your blood test?

>Had sex wit someone and directly after started having to pee often. 

That is known as *urinary urgency*. Herpes would not cause that.

>I have a red bumpy skin irritation on my vulva and anus that doesn't burn when I pee on it.

That sounds unlikely to be herpes. Lots of different things can cause redness and inflammation. Herpes would only cause certain kinds and the kind it can cause would generally not be described as ""bumpy"" unless it were also described as ""blistery"" or having blisters present. (and even then, herpes is not the only condition that can cause blisters in the genital region). Also, herpes lesions usually hurt a fair bit if urine comes into contact with them. 

>and I have pain around my ovaries. 

Herpes wouldn't cause that either.

I don't see what that has to do with my comment that you're replying to?

When I said your comment was incorrect, I was referring to your statement that hsv2 only infects the genitals. 

Upon reading your comment again, I'm now thinking that possibly isn't what you meant and you actually mean the opposite, though your writing in that regard is very unclear.",2022-03-18 18:54:57,1
tgw0we,"There are two types of herpes virus: hsv1 and hsv2. Either type can infect orally or genitally. So a person could have oral hsv1, or oral hsv2, or genital hsv2, or genital hsv2. That being said, oral hsv2 infections are uncommon. Hsv2 has a strong preference for the genital region so the vast majority of hsv2 infections are genital.

Some people mistakenly believe that hsv1 means an oral herpes infection and hsv2 means a genital herpes infection, but that's incorrect, especially regarding genital infections. Hsv1 now accounts for nearly half of new genital herpes infections.

Again: if you had a swab applied to your genital symptoms and it tested positive for hsv1, then you have a genital hsv1 infection. Genital hsv1 is almost always the result of receiving oral sex from a partner who had oral hsv1. Genital hsv1 is one of the least active kinds of herpes, and genital-to-genital hsv1 transmission outside of an active outbreak is very rare.

tgw0we,Im only confused about the fact that I'm protected from oral hsv1 now. I always assumed I had oral hsv1 cause I have a memory I had a cold sore once as a child. If this is correct and I already had oral hsv1 how could I get genital hsv1?,2022-03-18 13:18:09,1
tgw0we,Actually I read posts from people having both ohsv1 and ghsv1 so I guess you can have both and I misunderstood. That clears things up.,2022-03-18 13:43:50,1
tgw0we,"You could have also had like a bacterial infection and not cold sores.

Kids often get small skin or mouth infections at the corner of their lips where bacteria will collect and cause a little infection. That's what happened to me a few times when I was younger and mom thought it was a cold sore but... most likely wasn't.",2022-03-18 15:17:31,1
tgw0we,">If this is correct and I already had oral hsv1 how could I get genital hsv1?

A pre-existing oral hsv1 infection would, in the vast majority of cases, protect against a later genital hsv1 infection. However, there are rare exceptions. This situation is further unclear because you only remember a single instance of oral symptoms that were never confirmed as being herpes.",2022-03-18 18:45:49,1
tgw0we,">Actually I read posts from people having both ohsv1 and ghsv1 so I guess you can have both and I misunderstood. 

Again, it is extremely uncommon to catch hsv1 in a second location long after already having an hsv1 infection in another location. It's not impossible, it definitely happens, but it's *very* uncommon.

It's also possible for multiple body locations to get infected during the same encounter, or within 4 months of each other. It takes up to 4 months after the original infection for the body to generate enough antibodies that will, in the vast majority of cases, protect against further infection in other locations.",2022-03-18 18:50:27,1

tgti00,"If your partner already has hsv1 orally then he would be at no practical risk from your genital hsv1 infection.

Once a person is infected with a type of herpes in one location, they become largely protected from getting infected with the same type of herpes in another location at a later point in time,  whether by spreading an existing infection on themselves, or getting exposed to a partner's infection. This is because after one is infected with herpes the body creates antibodies to fight the virus. The body maintains these antibodies in the bloodstream and they protect from further infection. Different people generate antibodies at different rates, but by about 4 months post-infection the vast majority of people will have enough antibodies to prevent any further infection by the same type. Many people will have sufficient antibodies a lot sooner than that (eg after several weeks).

There *are* very rare exceptions to the above but that is the general rule.

Within four months of your genital infection you will similarly be protected from catching oral hsv1.",2022-03-18 10:23:56,3

I’m a straight female 25-year old and I also contracted ghsv1 from a sexual assault. It happened when I was 21 and that first outbreak was so painful and traumatic. All I wanted to do was hide and figure out why it had happened to me. I didnt get another outbreak until last may. I’m currently experiencing my 3rd. I just wanted to comment because I really connected to what you’re saying. Thinking about my rape is so hard as it is… to throw an outbreak in there really fucking sucks. I feel like no one will ever see me as anything other than a walking disease. With that being said I’m feeling less “end-all-be-all” this time around. I am VERY pro covid vaccine but I think that’s what kicked mine out of dormancy. Anyways thanks for creating this space to share!

tgrmea,"Hi there!!😌 A lot of people don’t realize they have herpes. I was a nurse at an OBGYN clinic for a couple of years, and most of my patients who came in and got diagnosed with herpes didn’t come in for herpes to begin with. For example, one day I had a patient who was coming in for a Pap smear after giving birth. When the doctor came in to examine her, she noticed a tiny bump, and the patient genuinely thought it was a razor bump (and I don’t blame her, it looked like a razor bump to me too).Turns out it was herpes. Plus to add to the confusion, most doctors do not test for herpes on a regular STD panel. For the longest time I thought I was std free because my doctor wasn’t up front with exactly every test that was ran on me. I assumed when he said my tests were negative that I was std free 110%. But he didn’t test for herpes, and that’s pretty typical for clinics in the US. I know there are people out there who can be shitheads and purposefully hide their status, and heck, maybe this guy is.

Just because someone has a high number of partners doesn’t mean anything. 
I got hsv affer 5 partners and I don’t even know if I got it from one of them or if I got it as a child and just had my first outbreak randomly years later. Because that’s literally how this illness manifests.

There's no way to know with absolute certainty without having actual visible symptoms swab tested. However, if you test positive for hsv2 and have never experienced symptoms orally or genitally then it is far, *far* more likely to be a genital infection. At least a 95% chance, and probably higher.

tg2oi6,My wife has hsv2. She was so afraid to tell me it almost caused a divorce because our intimacy stopped after marriage. I found her prescription and shit hit the fan. Not because of the hsv because she didn’t tell me. She is an amazing woman. I would have been with her regardless. I have been tested and tested negative. Read up on the statistics. Take precautions. It’s not the end of the world! It sucks yes but it’s a skin condition that is treatable. When she feels the tingle we just hold off and she doubles up on her suppressant. The stigma behind hsv was made by the big pharma to sell drugs. Be open be honest it really isn’t a big deal. If I get it I will deal with it.

tgn3ij,">My labia is burning no current OB can’t see any sores etc but it’s just a constant burning sensation… I’ve tried baths etc it helps while I’m it but as soon as I get out it starts again shortly after that… I have ghsv-1… and only had one OB with actual sores so far but the lingering symptoms haven’t went away

That is very unlikely to be a herpes issue. Are you saying that it started during your first outbreak and has persisted since? If so, how long has this been going on for?

Herpes can cause sometimes lingering sensations after a first-time outbreak over the ensuing weeks but they are usually fairly mild and not consistent with what you're describing. However, some women have been known to develop a yeast infection during their first herpes outbreak, and the yeast infection can sometimes persist well after the herpes outbreak has cleared. Some women in this situation then mistake their yeast symptoms as herpes symptoms. So that is one possibility here, though I can't say how likely it is.

There are other things that can cause chronic burning sensations in the genital region as well.

You weren't clear about the timeline but if this burning has been going on for more then a week after your outbreak has cleared then I suggest you run your situation by a doctor.",2022-03-18 02:21:09,2

tgcjgf,"Or you could be honest and tell her that, previously, your situation was unclear and your initial doctor messed up by not swabbing you. That led to later ambiguity when you did the responsible thing and pursued further testing, both swab and blood testing. You tested positive for hsv1, which *does* present considerable ambiguity if a person only presented with ambiguous symptoms initially -- when half the population will blood test positive for hsv1 because of how common oral hsv1 is. And that was mirrored by you doctor's comments. 

So you could approach the situation by telling your partner ""Hey, something's come up that I need to tell you about"". Relate the above, and how you only very recently experienced a genital outbreak that clarified everything, and so you want to bring this up with her. Also familiarize yourself with how low a risk genital hsv1 poses to partners. Even if your partner is a doctor, she may not be aware of this. Check out these two past comments regarding genital hsv1:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/41u6g3/how_long_did_you_wait_to_be_intimate_after/cz66hvh

I think it's discussed in the links above but also be aware that if your partner already happens to have hsv1 herself, even orally, your genital infection would pose no practical risk to her at all. She would already have hsv1 antibodies and be at no practical risk of further hsv1 infections in other locations. There *can* be rare exceptions to that but that is the general rule.",2022-03-17 21:25:32,5

This is a copy/paste of my disclosure advice to someone 

Disclosing is the main time herpes sucks. You can do it face to face, by text, over the phone… however you feel most comfortable. There are a couple general rules I follow that have always worked for me.

Work your disclosure into a conversation. You’re waiting on your moment. If he shares something personal, be supportive & then share about herpes.

Be short, factual, and concise. Don’t word vomit facts in one long run on sentence (I have done this before & it wasn’t pretty). Something along the lines of, “since you were open with me, I wanted to let you know that I have the herps. I take meds to keep it under control & prevent transmission & I’ve never passed it on,  Ask me whatever you’d like & ill always be open & honest about it”    Or , since this is more casual, “ask me whatever you want but I promise the sex will he hotttt” . Open the door to him asking questions about statistics or more details. Closing with something dirty will usually make them forget everything else you just said. Men are easily distracted by sex 😂

Just suggestions. All disclosures are different based on your relationship to the person & what the goal of the relationship is",2022-03-17 13:31:40,3
tg77al,"Ah man I’m repeating myself haha… ok so I just go with. (After date one if I think they’re cool)

“So I found out couple years back I must’ve had herpes before…. You probably do too” (I’m a bit of a joker)

But seriously the hardest thing is saying the word “herpes” out loud and it’s all plain sailing after that

Once the shock wears off I hit em with a couple of statistics and then say, “look, I haven’t had outbreaks and wouldn’t have even known unless my overly thorough graduate medical doctor wasn’t trying to impress his senior clinician by giving me a full screen”

“But I respect whatever decision you want to make, as sadly, somewhere down the track I wasn’t offered the same opportunity to make that decision”

“Oh and by the way, there is genuinely a better than evens chance you have herpes anyway”

🤣🤣

Obviously I tweak it here and there but I couldn’t care less anymore I only say it because it’s morally right",2022-03-18 13:34:31,2

tgkahw,">Can anyone tell me if a runny nose is common with an initial HSV2 infection?

No, herpes would definitely not cause a runny nose.

When it is said that herpes can cause flu-like symptoms, this is referring to symptoms similar to those of *influenza* (ie the flu) ie headache, fever, general body aches all over (not highly focused in and limited to a very specific area), light sensitivity, and swollen lymph nodes near the region of infection but not elsewhere (eg in the groin for genital infections, or in the head/neck for oral infections). Herpes would *not* cause symptoms of a cold, ie stuffy nose, runny nose, sore throat, cough, congestion, sinus issues, etc. (Oral herpes *could* cause a sore throat if it were to cause actual lesions in the throat itself, but that is very rare.)

Furthermore, the only circumstance in which herpes has the potential cause flu-like symptoms is from from a brand new infection that occurred within 2-10 days prior, and such symptoms would only occur if the person was experiencing at least moderate-to-extensive visible blisters/lesions as well, that would appear within a day or two of the flu-like symptoms, if not sooner.",2022-03-17 22:30:42,3

You're very welcome.

>On day 3 - 7 for me I had a constant temp of 99.5ish. In addition I had chills, fatigue and the skin all around my testicles and taint feel like they are burning still to now on day 8. I keep checking 2x a day and do not see lesions/sores. Went and tested a 10 panel today for a baseline, should I retest at 6 weeks?

Well your symptoms aren't suggestive of herpes in the first place, so herpes testing would not be warranted regarding these particular symptoms.",2022-03-18 02:29:53,1
tgkahw,[deleted],2022-03-18 02:40:17,1
tgkahw,">Ooohfuck- the severe burning sensation all over in the groin and taint, tingling on thighs, and everything else isn't indicative of herpes? 

That's correct.

> I have never had anything like this and the tingling began 24 hours after. Any idea what can present this way?

One of the most common conditions to cause fairly widespread tingling and burning sensations in the genital region is a fungal infection, aka ""jock itch"". But there can be other possibilities as well. Also, I don't know how much of your thighs are affected or how likely it would be for a fungal infection to include a considerable portion of your thighs. The parts of the thighs further away from the groin would be far less susceptible to jock itch because they'd get better ventilation.",2022-03-18 10:31:59,1

tgkahw,"When people have sex they also exchange germs, bacteria, fungal cultures, and possibly viruses. Any of these things have the potential to cause reactions. Having sex with someone is also a great way to catch a cold or flu. It isn't at all clear why you seem to be considering herpes as the only possible cause of your symptoms. 

I have attempted to explain to you, fairly extensively, that herpes would not be causing the symptoms you're experiencing. I don't think there's much else I can say that I haven't already. So at this point I'm going to  consider this discussion closed.",2022-03-18 12:26:09,1

tgdmk6,Hey man so unfortunately there aren't alot of statistics for us(MSM) to go by but I would imagine the rate of top/bottom transmission is similar to transmission rates for male and female hetero partners. It is easier for the top to transmit the virus but condoms cut the odds down by up to 96% and antivirals cut it down by another 50%. For bottoms it is harder to transmit from the top but condoms are around 40% less effective at preventing transmission to the top. Antivirals also cut the chance of transmission down by 50%. And there is already a very low chance of transmission if you do not have an outbreak and recognize your prodromal symptoms and don't have sex when you feel like an outbreak is coming on. Studies show that HSV+ people who know their status are 50% less likely of transmitting it to their partner and 80-90% of people with HSV have no idea that they have it so yeah just do the math lol. I would recommend telling him before things get really serious so sooner rather than right before you get sexual but it's your choice. I wish you the best of luck in your relationship,2022-03-24 22:15:51,1

tfyiuc,"I completely get what it’s like to feel like you have to stay. 

Especially in a small minded town with small minded people. 

Even without HSV, so many people, especially women, choose to stay with shitty and abusive partners because of the fear that being a single parent in a small town means they’ll be on the shelf forever. 

And if you choose to stay—I would never blame you. 

But you truly deserve better, and I do wholeheartedly believe that better is out there. Even in a small town. 

I grew up in a very small minded place and still saw courageous women leave their partners and find love when they had kids as a single mom. 

You deserve so much more than a man who manipulates you into believing that you gave him HSV2 and that this is the end of the world and you have to stay because of it.

If you’re too young to never have sex again, you’re too young to be saddled with this shitty man for the rest of your life—why give some of your best years to a man who hurts you and treats you so poorly? 

HSV2 is so much more common than we think it is, and for many people, it’s a relatively mild condition. I think disclosure is important and that safe sex is too—but I know that many people will still want you, regardless of your status. 

Even though there is stigma, there is also so much more information about living with HSV out there than ever before. You can be well informed, and so can your partners.

People are more understanding about herpes than you’d think—especially if you can explain the facts to them and talk clearly and in a straightforward way about what you do to take care of your own health and what you do to practice safe sex.",2022-03-17 06:53:57,3

tfyiuc,"Herpes is never a good enough reason to leave a good relationship, but more importantly, it's never a reason to stay in a bad one.

If you break your post down, you are saying that you feel so bad about yourself, that you are staying in an abusive relationship - with your kids - because you are too young to NOT HAVE SEX AGAIN. 

I can only hope this is your depression talking, or your fear of being alone, because it sounds like you are putting a lot of things ahead of your safety, and that of your kids' safety. 

Get counseling. Do it today. Start looking for ways to leave this man. If you have to leave town, do so. If you have to stand on the steps of city hall and shout that you have herpes just to own it and take your life back, do that. 

Everyone has shit they worry about people not accepting. Everyone. Let it go and own it, and focus on your safety. 

Don't let your insecurities become priority over your safety or that of your kids. Even if this man never lays a single hand on the kids, they'll know he's abusing you, even if it's only emotional abuse. I grew up in that kind of house. Kids always know.

tfyiuc,"
I got herpes from my ex a few months into our relationship. I stayed for 3 years. Don’t do it. He was emotionally abusive and manipulative and I definitely was scared to go partially because of my diagnosis but honestly? You have nothing to worry about. Some people will understand, others won’t. But here’s what I have come to accept at the end of the day… I don’t want to date someone who would react badly to a disclosure anyways. And you shouldn’t either, because that says a lot about that person. 

Being vulnerable is hard, and disclosing is weird and I don’t know if it ever stops being weird but I promise you, it gets better. 

My ex and I have been broken up for about 4 months now and I’ve had a few people I wanted to hookup with (met on apps) turn me down, but I’ve never had anyone I liked, and who liked me back turn me down. The research is out there, the information is there. If someone likes you enough, or quite frankly - respects you they will be willing to read it.

Honestly if my parents weren’t alive maybe I wouldn’t see the reason for me to continue like this. The rest of my family didn’t help me when I needed it they actually put obstacles to frustrate me even from their side they treated me like some sort of bullies.
I believe that you are lucky to have children and that you and them need a good respectful man by your sides and not one who’s with you for the same reason that you mentioned that you stato with him so since you both have the sti then you’re worried to find someone who’ll be with you, even I think that your partner wouldn’t have problems since he didn’t disclose with you. 
The more you stay with someone who doesn’t respect you as a human being, a partner, a mother, a female the more you let him bombard your self esteem so by staying with him you let him abuse you.

I don't care if nobody else don't love you ever love yourself and that don't mean you ain't going to get into another relationship I thought the same things 30 years ago I had herpes for 30 years I had all types of boyfriends I've been married twice nobody gave a damn about that s*** I disclosed we never thought about it again you hear me.  please don't stay abusive relationship because you got herpes simplex virus and thinking u are not good enough yes you are your even better because you love yourself first and foremost cuz that man or that woman can kill you and if he's  or she a narcissist he's counting on you to stay there.  abusive relationship for you can end up with something worse like PTSD or your head knocked off on a coma or somewhere hell no get up and stop feeling sorry for yourself and move on and start loving yourself for who you are and hell with herpes.,2022-03-17 21:07:22,2

It's harder to think that way until you're actually told that but my ex said something very nice when I've told him (we're good friends). He said that I'm a human being and not a sex toy and anyone should want me for everything else rather than just for my vagina. Sure one time things would be harder but even that hasn't stopped me.

I must say you have some deeper issues that exist outside of herpes. 

Your sense of low self worth started long before herpes and you need to come to terms with that portion. There are clearly some home issues or abandonment issues that resonate deep within you. 

Sex seems to be your escape route or proof to yourself that someone cares about you or something. 

You can not move past this issue until you examine the deeper issues that created all of your circumstances. There is a deeper reason why you must feel wanted by a man. You need to work on that before you can get the courage to stand on your own and have the confidence to walk through this life.",2022-03-17 18:04:20,3

That isn't entirely true. False positives on IgG tests occur in the low-positive range. Values above that range are much more reliable. Positive index values around 6 or above are *extremely* reliable.

So, when it comes to IgG tests, negative results can be a bit uncertain. But with positive results, the index value gives you a good idea of how reliable the result is, and whether confirmatory testing is recommended. In many cases, positive IgG results are entirely sufficient to confirm infection.

tg7ho6,I'm allergic to weed so... I can't really tell ya much.,2022-03-17 17:01:24,1
tgaxlo,I hate using condoms tbh. I caught herpes while using a condom. I think they protect females more then males.,2022-03-17 18:56:12,2
tgaxlo,I'm 90% sure I caught it wearing a condom. I'm pretty like 96% effective for protection if the man is the one with herpes and like 60% protection if the woman has herpes. The good news is as the man you are wayy less likely to catch it from her even without the condom but the small risk is there and will always be there even if she uses medication,2022-03-17 22:59:53,2
tgaxlo,I also caught it and was using protection.,2022-03-17 19:56:01,1
tgaxlo,Caught it as a male wearing protection as well. GHSV-2. Condom didn’t break but I did give oral so could’ve transferred from that.,2022-03-17 22:21:49,1
tgaxlo,It definitely helps if she’s not having an outbreak when y’all have protected sex…just saying…,2022-03-18 02:56:41,1
tgaxlo,"Female to male transmission is waaaaaayy lower than male to female transmission 

That said, there will be some small risk. I believe it's 2% chance of catching it for males from an infected female I'd you both have sex for twice a week for a year with the use of condoms, no antivirals and if she isn't having an outbreak. It's very low, only 1 higher than a girl on birth control getting pregnant (I think that's like 1% in a year)

I would recommend having a discussion with her about why she chose not to take antivirals and if she might consider taking them daily to reduce transmission risk to you down to 1% in an entire year. Antivirals will also reduce outbreaks in her (if she has any) which will lead to you being safer overall",2022-03-18 06:02:43,1
tgaxlo,Like did something break??,2022-03-17 21:35:23,1
tgaxlo,"i’m a female and caught it from a male even though he was wearing a condom. just depends on where you get your outbreaks i guess. i do believe female to male transmission is much lower though. again, depends on where she gets her outbreaks",2022-03-18 03:55:50,1
tgaxlo,Wow.. was it because the condom broke?,2022-03-17 21:34:25,1
tgaxlo,Man that’s disappointing. I so basically can’t do much sexually then,2022-03-17 22:49:47,0
tgaxlo,"Wanna add that I also caught GHSV2 from a man who didn't know his status/didn't tell me and therefore had sex with me while wearing a condom not realizing the razor burn on his balls was actually a herpes outbreak 

So naturally the condom didn't help one bit",2022-03-18 06:05:59,1
tgaxlo,No. Caught it on the base of my dick.,2022-03-18 00:11:09,1
tgaxlo,I don’t think where she gets her outbreaks matters. Unless you’re having an outbreak asymptomatic shedding happens everywhere where there is thin skin like the penis and the vagina. Not just where you get your outbreaks.,2022-03-18 07:03:09,1
tgaxlo,No the condom did not break. Herpes got on the skin at the base of the penis where the condom does not cover.,2022-03-18 15:55:12,1
tgaxlo,"It really depends on your approach to ghsv. I’m currently (to my knowledge) negative with a partner who has gHSV2 and we have never used protection since we went from friends to dating and having sex. I love her and having it doesn’t matter to me because I was given a choice going into the relationship and I chose her

Edit: I can’t remember the exact numbers but using condoms does significantly reduce the chance of transmission. Even more so if your partner is on antivirals as well",2022-03-18 00:17:04,2
tgaxlo,Thanks for your reply man 🙏🏽,2022-03-18 01:21:00,1

tfyto8,Dump him. He has reservations and there are plenty of men who won't. He's hurting your self esteem and emotional health.,2022-03-17 05:34:21,15
tfyto8,You need to just tell him like either he accepts you and the risk or he doesn't. This sounds not fun at all. Maybe he doesn't care about the physical aspect but that doesn't mean you need to not care.

I think its more damaging for your mental health to be in a relationship with someone who truly doesn't accept you to be honest with you. Clearly his aversion to things that you need for your pleasure is a big deal and something he may never get over.

tfyto8,"It’s selfish of him. I get having to come to terms with it and needing time, but you deserve someone that actually wants to please you without being scared - and you can find that.

tfoqkq,"Hey I understand the depression I was depressed for years until I finally decided enough was enough. I have been diagnosed for 10 years and have had  20+ partners since diagnosis. None of them to their knowledge have genital herpes some had cold sores. I am currently with a guy who is completely HSV negative he works at a blood lab and took a test just for shits and giggles.  He knows about my herpes I disclosed and he is completely fine with it and accepts the risks. There are plenty of people like this who do not care. Sitting around and waiting for a cure it’s silly you’re rejecting yourself before anyone even has a chance to think about it or reject you or accept you. You are putting limits on yourself before giving anyone else the opportunity to consider anything. People get rejected every day for a plethora of different reasons Sure there are people who ghosted me especially on tinder but as I talked to my friends I realized they got ghosted too and it wasn’t because of herpes it was because dating apps are cesspools in general. Dating nowadays sucks for so many reasons if you want to pin it on herpes go for it but that’s not the only reason. I was diagnosed with ghsv-1 at 19 and I thought my life was over I didn’t tell a soul cut off friends and everything because I felt so disgusting and gross. But eventually I put myself out there and had a few positive disclosure s and i began to realize that I was the one creating the stigma for myself.. The more people I told the less it weighted me down. Think of it logically friends should care because it doesn’t effect them. The only people your herpes effects are the people you are sleeping With. Friends are supposed to be your support system and if you tell them your story they should not judge you And they will learn from you And your experience. Hell you May even help a fellow herpes person out becuase if someone discloses to your friend after you teach them about herpes they will be more understanding and knowledgeable about it. But that’s up to you. I’ll attach some links that have seemed to help people and if you need anything please dm me.I’ve had it for almost a decade at this point and have a pretty good handle on it.

This first link is info about a support group I’m in. All herpes people from all over the world we all share are experiences, vent , swap info and remedies, and just talk about life it’s an awesome place to be for sure.

This is a disclosure guide with “scripts” on how to tell potential partners about herpes and what had worked for us. Mine is under Lauren. Also at the bottom it has resources about herpes to Send to partners.

https://docs.google.com/file/d/1vExi_t8aY_LzaIe7PB3DihQLW3QqJiW6/edit?usp=docslist_api&filetype=msword

This is a list of common myths about herpes and why they are wrong with cited sources. Maybe this can not only ease your mind but if a partner has questions you will have answers backed by science.

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-6oZmnfywTFNYScKYC7Mh7MXZKrA0GUcztS8Bz5bW0k/edit

This is a list of social Medias about herpes. Sometimes it does people good to see people being public about it and the amount of support they receive from strangers. The accounts are funny and informative and all herpes positive. There is everything on there from podcasts, YouTube, TikToks, blogs, Facebook support groups, Instagram pages, dating pages, subreddits, and websites.

You’re just one of many who is living with this, but you’re lucky to be one who knows about it. Stop the negative self-talk—you didn’t choose this, so why beat yourself up?

The best thing you can do for yourself is learn how to contain outbreaks, practice prophylaxis—arm yourself with information. There are ways to be safe, but still have fun. Soon this will just be another thing to know about yourself, like having allergies.

tfoqkq,"What part of the diagnosis is the worst for you? Do you have constant symptoms? Or is it just the mental and emotional aspect of \*knowing\* you have herpes?

This might be an unpopular opinion and I'm in no way trying to invalidate your feelings or your experience. That being said:

We have been taught as a society that STDs/Is are worse than any other viral or bacterial infections. This probably stems from organized religion and the idea of ""purity"" behind sex for better or for worse. But really, you're already a host to millions of bacteria and foreign microscopic organisms that you don't even think about. They've been living inside you since you were born, or even before. But you don't think about this as a bad thing because, even though we're taught this in high school biology/anatomy, we're not taught that it's scary or bad. In even the most progressive sex ed classes around the world, STDs are taught to be seen as scary and bad. But really, like almost any other illness (which you could easily have now without even knowing) it's only scary if left untreated or in severe cases. 

Don't get me wrong, herpes isn't fun by any means, but neither is any other sickness you might have. I've had herpes now for two years. I let the idea of it control my life for a few months, but soon realized that it was only different because of the way I was thinking. I had very few symptoms, and of the people with herpes I've talked to, a minority deal with regular symptoms for long, and transmission really isn't that common (again, just speaking from my experience).",2022-03-17 04:12:46,2

I’ve had successful relationships, (they were fine with the fact that I have it) I was with my ex for 12 years, we had unprotected sex pretty much that whole time and he never contracted it. I was recently in a 4 month relationship, again regular unprotected and he didn’t contract it. I’m not encouraging you to do this, obviously everyone needs informed consent, but the chances of you passing on GHSV1 through P/V sex is actually very unlikely, and typically people with GHSV1 have much fewer breakouts than HSV2 (this is because HSV1 prefers the mouth, HSV2 prefers the genitals). You can even take daily antivirals to help ease your mind. But just know that this isn’t the end of the world, HSV is VERY common, more people have it than you know!

tg55by,"Right yes you are contagious even not during an outbreak because you could be shedding. If you have frequent outbreaks you should consider going on antivirals. 

You can still kiss people. Most people you've ever kissed probably had ohsv1. 70% of people have it orally bur 80% of those people never have any outbreaks. So they don't know they have it ;). You also can't pass to them if they have it already. 

Oral well yeah so you can pass it on to them genitally if you give them oral and it's harder to protect them if it's oral and they're a woman. You can once again go on antivirals to give higher chances that you won't pass anything to them. If you happen to find someone who has it genitally even type 2 you can't give them herpes genitally again :) so oral becomes easier. 

You can still perform oral because chances of them getting type 1 genitally is lower and plus yes you can help it by 1) antivirals  and 2) don't go down on them if you have an outbreak of pre outbreak symptoms. Same goes for kissing ofc.


It is highly unlikely to pass on herpes by sharing food or other things because the virus passes on skin to skin contact but we've heard some stories apparently. I'd say to be sure don't do that during an outbreak but any other day you should be fine as it technically shouldn't pass on this way.

You have oral herpes, right? Why would that change anything for PIV sex? Your lips aren't on your dick :) 

If you have genital herpes then it'd be better to use condoms and maybe antivirals if that's something you don't mind. Women have higher chances of getting it genitally due to our vaginas. I don't see how you could get genital herpes from your mum however so I'm assuming you have it orally.",2022-03-17 10:43:38,1

I don’t think it will be negative since I have no idea what else it could be - but the only symptom I have is a sore on the tip of my penis which only hurts a lot when its touched or whenever I pee.

tfng4w,"Hey I understand the depression I was depressed for years until I finally decided enough was enough. I have been diagnosed for 10 years and have had  20+ partners since diagnosis. None of them to their knowledge have genital herpes some had cold sores. I am currently with a guy who is completely HSV negative he works at a blood lab and took a test just for shits and giggles.  He knows about my herpes I disclosed and he is completely fine with it and accepts the risks. There are plenty of people like this who do not care. Sitting around and waiting for a cure it’s silly you’re rejecting yourself before anyone even has a chance to think about it or reject you or accept you. You are putting limits on yourself before giving anyone else the opportunity to consider anything. People get rejected every day for a plethora of different reasons Sure there are people who ghosted me especially on tinder but as I talked to my friends I realized they got ghosted too and it wasn’t because of herpes it was because dating apps are cesspools in general. Dating nowadays sucks for so many reasons if you want to pin it on herpes go for it but that’s not the only reason. I was diagnosed with ghsv-1 at 19 and I thought my life was over I didn’t tell a soul cut off friends and everything because I felt so disgusting and gross. But eventually I put myself out there and had a few positive disclosure s and i began to realize that I was the one creating the stigma for myself.. The more people I told the less it weighted me down. Think of it logically friends should care because it doesn’t effect them. The only people your herpes effects are the people you are sleeping With. Friends are supposed to be your support system and if you tell them your story they should not judge you And they will learn from you And your experience. Hell you May even help a fellow herpes person out becuase if someone discloses to your friend after you teach them about herpes they will be more understanding and knowledgeable about it. But that’s up to you. I’ll attach some links that have seemed to help people and if you need anything please dm me.I’ve had it for almost a decade at this point and have a pretty good handle on it.

This first link is info about a support group I’m in. All herpes people from all over the world we all share are experiences, vent , swap info and remedies, and just talk about life it’s an awesome place to be for sure.

At first, I was worried and hated that I had an incurable STI, but then I realized it really isn't a big deal, literally over 60% of sexually active adults have it and if you take medication, it will have close to no impact on your life. I take Valtrex daily to prevent outbreaks and haven't had any since my first outbreak and diagnoses. It's something I don't even think about anymore. When you realize that so many people have it (with most not even knowing they do), it starts to ease your mind; at least it did for me.",2022-03-16 18:00:18,1
tfng4w,"If you love your husband and plan on being with him for the rest of your life, then there is nothing to worry about. Sounds like you have a pretty mild initial outbreak. The first is ALWAYS the worst; I got meningitis in my first outbreak, in part because I don't have HSV1 (if you acquire HSV2 after already having HSV1 you're much more likely to have a less severe first breakout or be asymptomatic).

The outbreaks will eventually stop with antivirals and you will be as if you don't even have it. Really, after that, the only issues come with disclosure to new partners; that is by and large the hardest part and I am currently 6/6 in disclosures as a 29M. In your case, again, that shouldn't be an issue. I am currently starting a romantic relationship with a 28F who is HSV negative. After four outbreaks (the next three after the initial one were incredibly mild) I am asymptomatic. You'll make it and you will still be able to have kids, if that's something you want.

Now that you both have it, you all will soon be free to engage in sexual activities without worrying all that much. Just wait a few months for the antibodies to build for oral so you don't get it there as well.",2022-03-16 22:03:39,1
tfng4w,"I just want to say that you are absolutely wonderful for accepting your husband with HSV. And that as long as you are happy with him the diagnosis shouldn’t matter. It’s the big stigma against having herpes down below that gets everyone all over the place. I would recommend seeing a doctor and possibly getting on some kind of anxiety and depressive meds. I take Lorazepam 20mg a day to help with depression and anxiety. I was diagnosed in September with HSV 1. And it tore me apart. I truly understand what you are going through. Especially because I am not married and I do disclose to people. I recently started seeing a therapist that has really helped to keep my mind clear. Do not feel shame for contracting this, because if we take out all the bs it’s no different then a skin infection. Look at it as like getting acne or having break outs once in a while. But no one can see them. The only ones that will know are you and your husband. Stay strong, outside of the two of you no one has to know. It’s up to you when and who you tell.

tfk6do,"I've had hsv2 for almost 20 years, and whenever I get symptoms like this, I have bacterial vaginosis. 

Also, prodrome means warning sign, essentially, and would last a day, tops, so what you are experiencing isn't prodrome if you aren't getting outbreaks. Some people get nerve pain from the antivirals and you are on a hell of a dose. The dose for suppression is 800 mg twice a day - maybe cut it back? 

Maybe get tested for yeast and BV, and see if you have either of those first, and then cut back on your dose of acyclovir. It's an awful lot. :( 

The other thing is that maybe you have a pinched nerve or something - something totally unrelated to herpes.

False negatives can occur at the 12-week mark and beyond as well. They are less likely at that point, but can still occur, and the rate is still substantial.

>It’s a lot easier to diagnose you if you’re having an OB, because they can confirm visually and swab them.

I think meant to say *inspected* visually and *tested* or *confirmed* via swab? Because herpes should never be *confirmed* based on visual inspection alone.

tfvb2o,"Are you saying your partner had a *single* sexual encounter with a woman who has hsv2? If so, the likelihood he got infected would be considerably *less* than 10%, and that's *especially* so when he hasn't experienced any symptoms suggestive of herpes.

Here are the female-to-male transmission stats for genital hsv2 within the constraints stated:

---

**Female-to-Male Ghsv2 transmission risk:**

If the situation is reversed and it's the woman who has genital hsv2 and the man doesn't and they both know she has it, if they have unprotected sex for an entire year (approximately twice per week) except during outbreaks and the woman takes no herpes medication, the man has a 4% chance of becoming infected by the end of the year.

To reiterate: having sex more or less often than twice per week would raise or lower that base figure accordingly. And that base figure comes from studies of couples already in long term relationships, and herpes is slightly more likely to transmit when the partners have been together less than 3 months, or when the infection is still fairly recent (eg first six months etc).

Condom use and herpes medication would each lower the female-to-male transmission risk by about 50% further from whatever it was before. So if the couple uses condoms *or* the woman takes medication, the annual risk to the man comes down to about 2%. And if they use both, it comes down to about 1%. As you can see, men are at considerably less risk of catching herpes than women when no condoms are used. But men also gain considerably less protection from condoms than do women.

---

So. It sounds like your partner wasn't in a long term relationship with that woman, so the risk may have been slightly higher than that stated above. But that should still give you a general sense of things.

>I'm wondering what the best way forward is to inform and protect myself?

I would suggest you consider the degree of likelihood he caught it, and then decide whether that would warrant your using condoms. Condoms provide women with a very high level of protection from herpes, though not quite complete.

>Invite him to take an IGG test now (~30 days after the last exposure so not ideal as I understand it should be 12+ weeks for most accurate results), only engage in condom-protected genital contact and PIV sex with him until 12 weeks have passed since the last exposure, then he can get another hopefully more conclusive IGG test?

Unless he had a considerable number of sexual encounters with the woman in question, I personally don't think that testing would be warranted in terms of that particular woman at least. If you're concerned about his status more generally then you could certainly ask him to get tested. And in that situation, it would likely be appropriate for you to get tested also. Genital hsv2 is fairly common, and a full 80% of the people who have it *don't know they have it*.",2022-03-17 00:25:36,3
tfvb2o,That’s very responsible of him to disclose that information to you.

tfvb2o,"Thanks for this reply!

My understanding is that he had unprotected sex multiple times with the woman who is HSV2 positive. I will try to find out from him how many times and when she was first infected. Am I right in thinking that the likelihood of transmission drops over time meaning if she's been living with HSV2 for several years it would be less likely to transmit? I don’t know if she was/is taking antiviral meds but will also try to find out from him. The 4% rate that you quote is quite reassuring. Do you have a reference for that please?

I would absolutely be using condoms with him until he can get an IGG test at 12+ weeks post the last exposure. My question is more whether refraining from all (condom-protected) genital-to-genital contact and PIV sex is prudent in the intervening time as I very much wish to avoid HSV2 if possible for a variety of reasons.

Point well taken about the mutual testing.

The preceding stats are regularly quoted by herpes expert Terri Warren on her online forum. Terri has a 35+ year career researching and treating herpes specifically, and was personally involved in the large-scale studies that determined the base transmission rates with vs without suppressive medication. 

Here are some examples of her stating the 4% stat:

>Without suppression on condoms, the transmission rates for HSV 2 infected females to uninfected males is about 4% – antivirals reduce the risk by half – condoms take the risk down to around 1-2%.

([Source](https://westoverheights.com/forum/question/how-to-time-a-wb-test/))

>The risk of transmission to an uninfected partner while you were taking Valtrex and having sex about twice per week is about 2% per year. If he uses condoms in addition, the rate drops to about 1% per year. More sex, more risk. 

([Source](https://westoverheights.com/forum/question/hsv2-for-9-months-questions-for-new-partner/))

>If you had been having sex with her twice a week for a year, not using condoms but with her on treatment, the risk of you becoming infected would be about 2%. So you can do the math and see how low your risk is for a single encounter.

([Source](https://westoverheights.com/forum/question/hsv2-worry/))

Etc.

If you search her forum for mentions of ""4%"" you are likely to find many more instances.

>My question is more whether refraining from all (condom-protected) genital-to-genital contact and PIV sex is prudent in the intervening time as I very much wish to avoid HSV2 if possible for a variety of reasons.

Well that's somewhat of a subjective question. You've seen the base transmission stats above for when condoms are used, and that's when the male *definitely* has ghsv2. That risk is *very* low. In your case the risk would be lower still, because it isn't clear that your partner even has it, and it's considerably more likely than not that he doesn't. 

Different people are comfortable with different levels of risk, but I would suggest to you that if you've had sex with partners in the past without requiring them to get tested first, that the risk here is about the same as it was in those past situations -- because some of your past partners have all but certainly had sex with people who had hsv2, whether they did so knowingly or not. Unless you've always insisted on testing before sex, or unless you've only had a very small number of partners so far, it's likely you've had sex with people in the past who had hsv2 also. And you've all but certainly had sex with partners who've had sex with people who had it.",2022-03-17 06:49:08,2
tfvb2o,"Both kinds of genital herpes, genital hsv1 and genital hsv2, post a very low risk of genital-to-oral transmission if no outbreak is present.

No matter whether a person has genital hsv1 or genital hsv2, the risk of genital-to-oral transmission is very low so long as no outbreak is present.

Genital hsv1 poses a very low risk of genital-to-oral transmission outside of an active outbreak because genital hsv1 is one of the least active kinds of herpes there is. It very rarely sheds asymptomatically (ie very rarely becomes active on the skin surface without causing actual visible symptoms). Then add to that the fact that the vast majority of exposures to asymptomatic shedding don't result in transmission *anyway*, and you can see the risk is very low. Genital hsv1 poses a very low risk of genital-to-*genital* transmission outside of active outbreaks for the same reason.

Genital hsv2, meanwhile, asymptomatically sheds considerably more frequently than genital hsv1. But hsv2 has a very strong preference for the genital region. Even when it is given the opportunity to infect orally it usually doesn't bother. Oral hsv2 *can* happen but is very uncommon. Here's a relevant quote from herpes expert Terri Warren:

>Getting HSV 2 orally through giving oral sex is very rare – I cannot say it is impossible. But with meds and no outbreak, the risk is incredibly low.

([Source](https://westoverheights.com/forum/question/hsv2hsv1-genital-oral-transmission/))

Furthermore still, in the very unlikely event that you *were* to get infected orally with hsv2, be aware that oral hsv2 is probably the best kind of herpes to have. First, it is the least active kind of herpes, by *far*. It hardly ever outbreaks beyond the first outbreak, and poses a virtually negligible risk to partners when no actual outbreak is present. And second, an established oral hsv2 infection not only provides protection against later infection with genital hsv2, but also protects against later infection with oral or genital hsv1. Basically, the least problematic kind of herpes protects against all the other kinds. It can take up to four months for a herpes infection to become established (ie to result in the body producing enough antibodies to protect from any further infection), but many people will have the protection in place much sooner than that. So this is something worth reflecting on also. Many people who have other kinds of herpes wish they could have caught oral hsv2 instead.",2022-03-17 06:53:17,1

tfv78t,">I have HSV2. My doctor said as long as the virus is not active I cannot transmit it to other people.

That's incorrect. The stats are for asymptomatic genital hsv2 transmission are well established:

---

**Male-to-Female Ghsv2 transmission risk:**

In studies of couples in long term relationships (ie together at least 3 months already) where the man has genital hsv2 and the woman doesn't and they both know he has it, if they have *unprotected* sex for an entire year (approximately twice per week) except during outbreaks, and the man takes no herpes medication, the woman has about a 10% chance of becoming infected by the end of the year.

Having sex more or less often than twice per week would raise or lower that base figure accordingly. Also note that that base figure comes from studies of couples already in long term relationships, and herpes is slightly more likely to transmit when the partners have been together less than 3 months. We aren't sure exactly *how* much higher the risk is before the 3-month mark, but we know its definitely higher. We also know that herpes is more active when the infection is recent, eg during the first 6-12 months of having it (the decline is gradual).

If the man takes daily herpes medication that would lower the risk to the woman by about 50%, bringing the annual risk from about 10% down to about 5%. Furthermore, condoms have been found to provide women with a very high level of protection from herpes, though not quite complete. One recent large scale study found that condoms reduce male-to-female herpes transmission risk by a further 96%. Herpes expert Terri Warren thinks that might be a *bit* on the high side, but not by much. So consider well over a further 90% reduction. So without condoms or medication, the annual risk to the woman is about 10%. With medication it falls to about 5%. With condoms but no medication it would be about 1%. And with medication *and* condoms it's well under 1%. 

**Female-to-Male Ghsv2 transmission risk:**

If the situation is reversed and it's the woman who has genital hsv2 and the man doesn't and they both know she has it, if they have unprotected sex for an entire year (approximately twice per week) except during outbreaks and the woman takes no herpes medication, the man has a 4% chance of becoming infected by the end of the year.

To reiterate: having sex more or less often than twice per week would raise or lower that base figure accordingly. And that base figure comes from studies of couples already in long term relationships, and herpes is slightly more likely to transmit when the partners have been together less than 3 months, or when the infection is still fairly recent (eg first six months etc).

Condom use and herpes medication would each lower the female-to-male transmission risk by about 50% further from whatever it was before. So if the couple uses condoms *or* the woman takes medication, the annual risk to the man comes down to about 2%. And if they use both, it comes down to about 1%. As you can see, men are at considerably less risk of catching herpes than women when no condoms are used. But men also gain considerably less protection from condoms than do women.

He knows about my herpes I disclosed and he is completely fine with it and accepts the risks. There are plenty of people like this who do not care. Sitting around and waiting for a cure it’s silly you’re rejecting yourself before anyone even has a chance to think about it or reject you or accept you. You are putting limits on yourself before giving anyone else the opportunity to consider anything. People get rejected every day for a plethora of different reasons Sure there are people who ghosted me especially on tinder but as I talked to my friends I realized they got ghosted too and it wasn’t because of herpes it was because dating apps are cesspools in general. Dating nowadays sucks for so many reasons if you want to pin it on herpes go for it but that’s not the only reason. I was diagnosed with ghsv-1 at 19 and I thought my life was over I didn’t tell a soul cut off friends and everything because I felt so disgusting and gross. But eventually I put myself out there and had a few positive disclosure s and i began to realize that I was the one creating the stigma for myself.. The more people I told the less it weighted me down. Think of it logically friends should care because it doesn’t effect them.

I have type 1 genital, and I just don’t know where I could’ve gotten it from. you will find someone who cares about you deeply. they’ll be able to look past this disease. I was so devastated I was going to kill myself, but I realized that it isn’t as bad as I thought. it’s only the stigma. if you need to talk to someone, i’m all ears. you’re not alone in this. 

I don’t usually comment on posts like these, but I agree i’m hoping for a cure in the next 5 years that’s affordable. More people have it than they realize, and the worst thing about this disease is the stigma only. over 60% of the US population has herpes.

tf7vtl,"Take a deep breath, this is a very common and stigmatized disease.  You should also note, that as a woman you are far more likely after disclosure to not have any issues.

Don’t let the fact pharma stigmatized this in the 70s in the US break you down.  I know the feeling, but it will be okay.  When I was 19 I had a woman disclose she had HSV and I passed.  By the time I was in my early 20s, I had sexual encounters with many women that disclosed, without protection (not advocating for this), and had a blast.  I got HSV-1 from my kids - my daughter gave me a big hug and kiss when I got home, and had nasty cold sores the next day, I got symptoms a few days later, and transferred it from my face to G during my primary infection just a couple of days later.  Grand times.

I am not in a situation where I need to dislocose.  I respect people that chose to. But the CDC either needs to recommend HSV is tested in al STI panels, or society needs to stop pressuring on disclosure.  They’re putting a huge stigma and burden on a very small % of those infected, and it’s not right.

If society want’s disclosure, everyone should know their status to the best of their ability.

tf7vtl,"Comment removed. That is a known bogus treatment.

There is no cure for herpes at the present time -- whether natural or pharmaceutical. Anyone who claims otherwise is either extremely poorly informed or is trying to scam others. If/when an actual, legitimate cure is developed it will be front page news all over the world and will be readily confirmed as genuine by well known and highly respected figures in the medical community, as opposed to being promoted by random websites or instagram posts or youtube videos by people that either no one has ever heard of, or who have no formal medical training whatsoever, and whose claims have not been independently verified by any person or agency with any established reputation that is qualified to do so and whose credentials can be readily verified.

Be aware that the people promoting these ""cures"" often believe that a negative IgG blood test result is evidence that they have cured themselves or others, when all it actually demonstrates is that they don't have an even *basic* understanding of herpes testing. An IgG blood test routinely misses 8% of hsv2 infections and a whopping 30% of hsv1 infections. This is well established. So if you come across someone claiming they have cured themselves and their evidence is a negative IgG blood test, that fact alone indicates that they have no clue what they're talking about and have *not* cured themselves. An IgG test would not be an appropriate test for determining whether herpes has been cured.",2022-03-16 09:43:25,2

So young people are first becoming exposed during oral sex.

tflr99,"Hi friend. First off, I wanted to say your frustration is seen, heard, and understood by so many of us. We are in this together. 

I had been struggling with a nonstop contant string of outbreaks for 4 months straight. You're welcome to check my post history if you want to read into my situation a little. Antivirals stopped working out of the blue after 8 years and I was being ravaged by this virus, much like you. No relief in sight, I felt absolutely hopeless.

And then I discovered SADBE. I'm sure you've seen in mentioned here and there on this sub along with a whole host of other ""suppliments."" I had brushed it off for so long... and then I actually decided to look into it. It's incredible. 

Squarex is a company currently raising funds for phase 3 clinical trials for the use of SADBE for HSV. Its a medication you rub into a dime size area on your inner arm once every 3 months and it's been shown to cause aassive reduction in HSV outbreaks. 

The struggle is that its not on the market for HSV. So if you want to try it you have to convince a doctor to prescribe it for you off-label. You have to thoroughly educate yourself on the clinical trials and come armed with knowledge. I was turned down by my OB when I asked him to prescribe it... but I was lucky enough to have a primary doctor kind enough to let me try. I did my first application of SADBE 3.5 weeks ago and for the first time in 4 months (of absolute HELL)  I'm completely outbreak free.

tfm9kn,"**Male-to-Female Ghsv2 transmission risk:**

In studies of couples in long term relationships (ie together at least 3 months already) where the man has genital hsv2 and the woman doesn't and they both know he has it, if they have *unprotected* sex for an entire year (approximately twice per week) except during outbreaks, and the man takes no herpes medication, the woman has about a 10% chance of becoming infected by the end of the year.

Having sex more or less often than twice per week would raise or lower that base figure accordingly. Also note that that base figure comes from studies of couples already in long term relationships, and herpes is slightly more likely to transmit when the partners have been together less than 3 months. We aren't sure exactly *how* much higher the risk is before the 3-month mark, but we know its definitely higher. We also know that herpes is more active when the infection is recent, eg during the first 6-12 months of having it (the decline is gradual).

If the man takes daily herpes medication that would lower the risk to the woman by about 50%, bringing the annual risk from about 10% down to about 5%. Furthermore, condoms have been found to provide women with a very high level of protection from herpes, though not quite complete. One recent large scale study found that condoms reduce male-to-female herpes transmission risk by a further 96%. Herpes expert Terri Warren thinks that might be a *bit* on the high side, but not by much. So consider well over a further 90% reduction. So without condoms or medication, the annual risk to the woman is about 10%. With medication it falls to about 5%. With condoms but no medication it would be about 1%. And with medication *and* condoms it's well under 1%. 

**Female-to-Male Ghsv2 transmission risk:**

If the situation is reversed and it's the woman who has genital hsv2 and the man doesn't and they both know she has it, if they have unprotected sex for an entire year (approximately twice per week) except during outbreaks and the woman takes no herpes medication, the man has a 4% chance of becoming infected by the end of the year.

To reiterate: having sex more or less often than twice per week would raise or lower that base figure accordingly. And that base figure comes from studies of couples already in long term relationships, and herpes is slightly more likely to transmit when the partners have been together less than 3 months, or when the infection is still fairly recent (eg first six months etc).

Condom use and herpes medication would each lower the female-to-male transmission risk by about 50% further from whatever it was before. So if the couple uses condoms *or* the woman takes medication, the annual risk to the man comes down to about 2%. And if they use both, it comes down to about 1%. As you can see, men are at considerably less risk of catching herpes than women when no condoms are used. But men also gain considerably less protection from condoms than do women.",2022-03-16 23:25:31,1

tfm9kn,">I’m experiencing similar issues and have had a bump that’s been there for the past 6 weeks.

Herpes lesions last 2-10 days and they go through their entire series of phases within that time (blister formation, blister, blister surface erosion leaving an ulcer, crusting/scabbing, and scab healing), so they don't remain looking unchanged for more than a day or two either.

Your bump can be ruled out as being herpes based on the length of time it has been there.",2022-03-17 04:13:17,2

tfm6gz,"For me personally, sun exposure does not influence my outbreak frequency. I have GHSV2 and I can lay out naked for hours with no issues. My partner on the other hand has OHSV1, and is very sensitive to things like over-chapped lips, windburn and sunburn. Any irritation to the lips and he gets worried he might get a cold sore. I think HSV this is just one of those things where everyone's body reacts differently. And you will unfortunately just need to play it by ear while you learn how your body does. My advice though is for the summer, make sure you are properly hydrated, wear high SPF on your face and/or a hat, use chapsticks and other irritation preventatives. From my experience if your skin is happy then OBs are less likely to flare up due to irritants/sun exposure.

No, those would definitely *not* be common symptoms for someone with oral hsv1 and those particular symptoms do *not* suggest that you caught oral hsv1. They don't rule out the possibility, but they don't suggest it either.

tes3d6,"I'm going to paste exactly what I wrote earlier today to someone.   
  
I'm a 29M and have had HSV2 for over three years. HSV2 commonly affects the genitals but can be oral as well; HSV1, while preferring the mouth, is responsible for up to half of new genital herpes infections. I've had a total of four outbreaks (all in the first year). I haven't had any outbreaks since. This is how it is even for a vast majority of people that get this. Over 80% of people that contract HSV2 NEVER have ANY symptoms and are out there spreading this because they have no idea they have it. An estimated 1/6 Americans have HSV2. For those who have symptoms at first, the outbreaks decrease with severity and amount and eventually will cease entirely. Most of the horror stories on here are the exception, not the rule - I would say probably 5-10% of the people who get herpes are likely immunocompromised and suffer recurrent outbreaks - which can easily be managed with antivirals. It is, as is often described, a skin infection - one that doesn't decrease your lifespan or really affect your ability to have children (neonatal herpes being passed through childbirth is 3 times less likely than you giving birth to a child with down syndrome).  
  
Having this myself, I can say that this is NOT a big deal at all and I do not get the stigma surrounding it. That's really the only problem IMO about having this - others' assumptions and stereotypes about the infection. I will say this - of course, for a guy, the symptoms aren't as painful because if we do get sores, they tend to be outside versus inside. It's very possible you already have it or HSV1. Ironically, if this guy ONLY has HSV2 and didn't ever have HSV1 and you did, YOU could have given him genital herpes. I am in this boat, I tested negative for HSV1 when I got tested a few months back for my HSV negative partner.  
  
If you all have 2-3 sex acts per week, there is about a 10% chance of you acquiring the virus in a given year (this is without protection). Again, if you contract it - there is an over 80% chance you never get ANY symptoms. Daily antivirals reduce the chances to about 5% per year. Condoms, conservatively, reduce the chances by another 50%; however there is research by Teri Warren that shows condom use may reduce transmission rates from M to F by up to 96%. Conservatively, the use of antivirals AND condoms will result in a 2.5% yearly chance - but we may be talking well under 1% due to condom use with antivirals. Oral with HSV2 is generally safe as it does not like the mouth area, but is still possible (but under 1%); use a condom at first if you're not comfortable. Also, the longer he has it, the less he sheds the virus. If he's asymptomatic (doesn't have outbreaks anymore) this also leads to a reduction in overall shedding. People without symptoms shed less on average than those that still get outbreaks. Asymptomatic shedding (with no sores) IS responsible for up to 70% of transmissions, so YES, that IS possible, but again, this is hindered by taking daily antivirals and condoms.  
  
The vast majority of us on here that got it (90%+) was NOT from someone who disclosed and was honest with us; it was from someone who didn't know they had it OR KNEW AND LIED/NEVER TOLD. I was in the second boat; my ex-girlfriend knew she had it and didn't tell me out of fear I would have rejected her. If she had told me, I would have not have rejected her; her being honest with me and showing me all the precautions would have been a massive green flag for me and by taking those precautions I VERY LIKELY would not have it today.  
  
For the few that have contracted it after taking the risk and when given the choice, the anecdotes I've seen from people is that they didn't contract it until years into the relationship - which at that point I would imagine most people are happily married and don't care anymore.  
  
This guy is presumably looking for a long-term relationship and by telling you this is communicating his desire to be honest with you, even with the chance that you turn him down as a result. Clearly, he's not looking to lie to you or mislead for the possibility of cheap sex; so many people pass this on or lie about it just to get laid. Consider that a MASSIVE GREEN FLAG.  
  
Still, if you're hesitant, I recommend taking it slow with him and getting to know if you two are compatible. Sex is good, sex is great; but I'm taking it slow with a woman who is HSV negative right now because I desire so much more. Sounds like he does too.",2022-03-15 17:59:07,26
tes3d6,"I would ask if he’s on antivirals and maybe ask what measures he took in the past to make sure he didn’t pass it. I’m sure someone here will provide you with more specific transition rates than I can as I am a female with ghsv and from my understanding the rates are different between male to female vs female to male transmission. From my understanding the longer you have it the less likely it gets to shed - as your body learns to fight it off and create more antibodies. And seeming as he said he’s had it for 17/18 years it could be low. As long as you know the risk isn’t completely 0, you yourself have to make sure you’re okay with the possibility of getting it. Asking questions and doing your own research is already a great step in the right direction.

tes3d6,There’s condoms you can order from Japan (vivagel) that are supposed to be virucidal to HSV. I’m sure if you rub one of those condoms on all exposed areas it would kill most of the HSV but I’m not sure. I’ve used SADBE and red marine algae to get my infection under good immune control but I’m not sure how that effects shedding/transmission but I assume I’m less contagious. He may want to try those interventions to reduce shedding and risk of transmission.

Let’s assume he’s actually positive, after 17/18 years the risk of transmission drops. HSV is most contagious during an outbreak (which he says he doesn’t have), but can be spread when asymptomatic (but this risk goes down over the years). I highly recommend asking him what he does to prevent OBs. If he doesn’t do anything, he might be willing to if you were to ask him. I take 1g of valacyclovir daily (an antiviral that can be used to reduce the frequency and severity of OBs and get rid of OBs when you have them), lysine (an amino acid which counteracts arginine, which is something that hsv needs to replicate), and red marine algae (which reduces the frequency and severity of OBs). The antiviral is a prescription and so he may not have access to it or want to take it. The other 2 are supplements, so even if he doesn’t take them now, he may be willing to if you ask him :)",2022-03-16 12:48:59,2

Caught it at 22. I had outbreaks back to back for an entire year with maybe an outbreak every two months for the following two or three years. Dropped down to four times a year after that. That's not necessarily in the downstairs, though - I have had outbreaks on my arm, my thigh (where I first contacted it with a partner I used a condom with every time,) and worst of all inside my nose, which is incredibly painful and embarrassing and it shows outside of my nose, too. Also in my anus. It can infect your eye and I'm shocked it didn't with me. 

12 years later I get them much less but oh boy when I do, they're pretty bad. Any time I've tried medication it makes it worse, so much fun. 

I'm behind what that other poster said - frivolous sex isn't worth it, but maybe we're just old. I had a kid with a guy I was in love with, but we split up, and so the idea of having a baby without a serious relationship sounds horrific. 

Now --- good points. I was dangerously promiscuous. I was on a route of getting into a scary mess of trafficking or death, who knows.

>Risk with 2 sex acts a year is 5 percent with condoms and antivirals and 2.5 conservatively with both. M to F

Did you mean to say 2 sex act *per week* for an entire year? Because, otherwise, that statement is *way* off and grossly overestimates the risk. 

Even if you meant to say per 2 sex acts per week for an entire year, your stats are still a bit off. Here are the stats for male-to-female genital hsv2 transmission within the constraints stated. Note that it's important to specify the constraints when providing these stats:

---

**Male-to-Female Ghsv2 transmission risk:**

In studies of couples in long term relationships (ie together at least 3 months already) where the man has genital hsv2 and the woman doesn't and they both know he has it, if they have *unprotected* sex for an entire year (approximately twice per week) except during outbreaks, and the man takes no herpes medication, the woman has about a 10% chance of becoming infected by the end of the year.

Having sex more or less often than twice per week would raise or lower that base figure accordingly. Also note that that base figure comes from studies of couples already in long term relationships, and herpes is slightly more likely to transmit when the partners have been together less than 3 months. We aren't sure exactly *how* much higher the risk is before the 3-month mark, but we know its definitely higher. Herpes is also known to be more active when the infection is recent, most notably during the first 6-12 months of having it (the decline is gradual).

If the man takes daily herpes medication that would lower the risk to the woman by about 50%, bringing the annual risk from about 10% down to about 5%. Furthermore, condoms have been found to provide women with a very high level of protection from herpes, though not quite complete. One recent large scale study found that condoms reduce male-to-female herpes transmission risk by a further 96%. Herpes expert Terri Warren thinks that might be a *bit* on the high side, but not by much. So consider well over a further 90% reduction. So without condoms or medication, the annual risk to the woman is about 10%. With medication it falls to about 5%. With condoms but no medication it would be about 1%. And with medication *and* condoms it's well under 1%.",2022-03-15 23:13:07,3
tes3d6,"Exactly - I'm not sure where it will go, maybe something serious, maybe not, but I think I'm being smart about this. We're both adults, and sexual compatibility is important to both of us in pursuing a relationship. I find the notion that I'm being frivolous about sex almost laughable when I'm actually taking things slow and doing my due diligence with my partner before we take things any further. I'm *choosing* to potentially engage in sex with someone I'm interested in, have chemistry with and who has been nothing but respectful and transparent.

tf72yy,">2.64 value for the Igg and they said hsv2. When they called they said I tested positive for exposure and to come back in three months and that was it. Just wondering what the odds are it could be hsv1 or a false positive.

An IgG test would not mix up hsv1 and hsv2. But they *can* sometimes report false positives. Your index value fell into the range where there's a substantial possibility of it being a false positive.

Statistically, the odds of an hsv2 index value of 2.64 being a false positive are probably around 40-45%.  

Here's a quote from herpes expert Terri Warren regarding an hsv2 index value of 2.68 having a 40% chance of being a false positive:

>So at an index value of 2.68, there is probably a 40% chance that this is a false positive. 

([Source](https://westoverheights.com/forum/question/2-68-results-for-herpes-2/))

Your index value is very slightly lower than that, and so may have a slightly greater likelihood of being false (the lower the value, the more likely to be a false positive)",2022-03-17 10:19:29,1

Witch hazel works WONDERS I still plan on using it in the event of more flare ups.

IMO this helps the sores clear faster. I had wipes I’d carry with me on bad days if I was going to be out for long times but I felt the wipes were too rough (and bad for the environment) for constant use. I also had a bidet (about 30$ on Amazon; easy enough to install) that I feel helped not cause further irritation. I’d start this process once I felt a flare up coming.

I would also take lysine supplements, specifically the Quantum Health Super Lysine+. My flare ups would be pretty bad and this worked better than the basic lysine but regular lysine may work for you. I tried to take this regularly but would often forget and start taking doses as soon as I felt the slightest tingle.

Herpes can’t cause an abnormal Pap test. 
You also shouldn’t be scared because of the test results. The Pap test will tell you something about cancer or cell changes. You are in Group 3 I think.
Normally your immune system will fight against these. But you have to do the test every 6 months because if these cell changes will get really bad you can react really fast.

Same thing happened to me. I was diagnosed recently with GHSV2 through blood test and my Pap smear came abnormal. When I was diagnosed with herpes along with the abnormal Pap smear I spent one month none stop crying with high blood pressure, major anxiety and stress. All of this brought a shock to me so my reaction compromised my mental health and my physical health (no sign of OB tho just a lot of nerve pain and tingling). 

Took two weeks for them to reach out to me with the Pap smear and a few days to schedule another appt. They had to do a colposcopy and also an biopsy because they noted abnormal findings when they did the colposcopy. 

All in all after 4 weeks - I got my results and they came normal. 

Sometimes your cervix will have changes, especially if you had sex recently before getting your Pap smear. 

My findings were benign squamous cell tissues with blood and mucus debris, and benign endocervical glands. No sign of malignancy or dysplasia. In other words, NORMAL. And these cells WILL clear out on its own in few weeks.

Pap smears are specifically for the testing of cervical cancers and HPV. There are many types of HPV. Some cause warts and some cause cancer. Sometimes you can have an abnormal pap just due to stress or whatever so that’s why they repeat them. Herpes would not be an “abnormal” result call. They would tell you if they saw herpes cells. 

I recommend calling your provider and asking for clarification on your pap results and for them to explain it better to you. Sometimes doctors don’t realize that they need to explain things better.

Also try not to stress. I know it’s easier said than done. Abnormal paps happen all of the time.

Cervical cancer isn't the fastest spreading, so even if it's found deeper it can be treated/layers frozen off.

Sorry that your doctor was heavy on the shame RE protection—yes. It’s important to use condoms. And that importance is hard to overstate—the main STI they protect really well against is HIV, and HIV rates are on the rise again globally among heterosexuals.

But I also think that your doctor stressing the importance of using condoms is in no way somehow evidence that you should be super anxious about this being HSV. 

Stay calm, get tested. I’d also recommend getting a test for a yeast infection and a UTI given some of the stuff you’ve been describing.",2022-03-16 09:21:10,1

As for the neuralgia, assuming that’s what the pain is (I may be wrong as it may just be the current outbreak causing the sensation) this nerve pain may be your biggest issue as the outbreak clears up. 

Keep the area clean and dry.  Never touch it with your bare fingers (get medical gloves) and if necessary consider wrapping it with something and taping it.  I’m assuming you have pain while walking & wearing clothes. 

I’ll DM you too.  Check your chats.",2022-03-15 14:29:32,1

tek7c4,"Hey I understand the depression I was depressed for years until I finally decided enough was enough. I have been diagnosed for 10 years and have had  20+ partners since diagnosis. None of them to their knowledge have genital herpes some had cold sores. I am currently with a guy who is completely HSV negative he works at a blood lab and took a test just for shits and giggles.  He knows about my herpes I disclosed and he is completely fine with it and accepts the risks. There are plenty of people like this who do not care. Sitting around and waiting for a cure it’s silly you’re rejecting yourself before anyone even has a chance to think about it or reject you or accept you. You are putting limits on yourself before giving anyone else the opportunity to consider anything. People get rejected every day for a plethora of different reasons Sure there are people who ghosted me especially on tinder but as I talked to my friends I realized they got ghosted too and it wasn’t because of herpes it was because dating apps are cesspools in general. Dating nowadays sucks for so many reasons if you want to pin it on herpes go for it but that’s not the only reason. I was diagnosed with ghsv-1 at 19 and I thought my life was over I didn’t tell a soul cut off friends and everything because I felt so disgusting and gross. But eventually I put myself out there and had a few positive disclosure s and i began to realize that I was the one creating the stigma for myself.. The more people I told the less it weighted me down. Think of it logically friends should care because it doesn’t effect them. The only people your herpes effects are the people you are sleeping With. Friends are supposed to be your support system and if you tell them your story they should not judge you And they will learn from you And your experience. Hell you May even help a fellow herpes person out becuase if someone discloses to your friend after you teach them about herpes they will be more understanding and knowledgeable about it. But that’s up to you. I’ll attach some links that have seemed to help people and if you need anything please dm me.I’ve had it for almost a decade at this point and have a pretty good handle on it.

Yeast infections and fungal infections (aka ""jock itch"") can cause the sort of chronic symptoms you describe. In some cases, yeast can even cause small sores/blisters.

tezf7b,hi :) thanks for the feedback. i used to get yeast infections in high school and they felt nothing like this. and the discharge i had was more thick whereas the “discharge” that im currently experiencing/ have experienced during previous flareups are more milky. i also used things like Monistat and other remedies for yeast infections and they only made it worse. that was before i was diagnosed. i’m not really sure how to go about treating it if it is a fungal infection because i’m afraid treatment will only make it worse.,2022-03-19 18:49:29,1

tezf7b,"It sounds like a trip to the doctor might be warranted, don't you think? 

Herpes would not cause milky discharge. The only kind of vaginal discharge that herpes would cause would be clear and very watery/runny. And the only possibility for it to occur in any substantial quantity is during a primary outbreak that starts within 2-10 days of becoming infected. The discharge is caused when a considerable number of herpes lesions occur inside the vagina and/or on the cervix. The lesions cause some cell walls to break down, and the cells to rupture and spill out their watery contents. That's what the discharge is.

And again, numerous other aspects of your symptoms are not suggestive of herpes either.",2022-03-19 20:45:18,1

I struggle with anxiety and lately it’s been really bad so sometimes I don’t sleep for a day or two and then sleep for an entire day after. my body is exhausted but I also can’t fall asleep so I usually just drink two or 3 cups of coffee (with oat milk) a day.

tezf7b,">I asked about wether it’s a fungal infection or a yeast infection and she told me it’s not either.

So did she tell you what she thinks it *is*?

> she told me that since i’m super sexually actively it’s making it worse because i’m not giving my vagina time to recover from the flareups or something.

Right, but what is ""it""? What is the underlying condition that she thinks is causing the symptoms? Because herpes would not cause ""about a year and a half being in constant pain and itching"", not matter how much sex you're having. Herpes simply doesn't work that way. Nor would herpes cause milky discharge under any circumstance. So what does she suspect the underlying condition is, that she's claiming you're exacerbating by being very sexually active?

If your doctor is suggesting this is herpes then I would suggest you consider posting on herpes expert Terri Warren's online clinic forum. Terri has a 35+ year career researching and treating herpes specifically. There is a US$20 fee to post on her forum but she will answer your post personally and she is far more knowledgeable regarding herpes than doctors in general practice. And she is a recognized expert on the topic as opposed to an anonymous internet stranger like myself. But again, unless I'm misunderstanding something about your situation, this sound very unlikely to be herpes and much more likely to be something else.

If you're interested in posting on Terri's forum, you can access it here:

tewjhp,"I didn’t get my period for 5 months, I would get some bloody discharge scattered on random days sometimes 1-3 days spotting. I got my first real period last month and I’m due now but it hasn’t come. It’s super weird. I was normal before it happened.",2022-03-15 19:56:32,2
tewjhp,My period was over 20 days late. I don’t know if it was because of the HSV or if it was I took a plan B. But I was for sure worried. It went back to normal after that though,2022-03-15 23:07:24,2
tewjhp,I’ve googled and can’t find any correlation. 🤔,2022-03-15 19:57:25,1
tewjhp,I didn’t either. . Maybe it’s not reported as much or guaranteed to happen to all girls idk,2022-03-15 19:58:04,2
tevoq0,Yes possible - letting it dry helps the scabs form. Consider soaking cotton pads in salt water and dab on the sores - dries them out and ofc then you can use very precise application,2022-03-15 21:03:39,1
tevo4u,Igg tests are not very reliable. Alot of false postive results but usually below 0.9 is negative,2022-03-15 23:19:37,2

tevo4u,I believe so as well. My most recent sexual partner is a physician and he also was convicted I am not a HSV positive individual. Of course I had reason to be skeptical. Thank you for your response.,2022-03-15 19:00:44,1

tejbcv,Never heard of a Pap smear detecting HSV but this may be new to me. It’s worth tagging the mod & see the response. I would recommend getting an iGG blood test at this point & see what that comes back with.,2022-03-15 11:00:33,8
tejbcv,I legitimately don’t know why I’m getting downvoted for sharing my lived experience on how I was diagnosed. But ok.,2022-03-15 14:53:02,4

tejbcv,"Hello when i had my first outbreak of herpes, i had fever and muscle soreness. It hurt when i peed because the sore / outbreak blister was hit by my pee. Check your vag for any blisters. 

I get my routine pap smear and i saw that it also had a herpes portion. Mine was negative at the time because i didnt have any outbreaks",2022-03-15 16:37:42,2
tejbcv,"My herpes was diagnosed via Pap smear. A lot of folks have internal OB without even knowing. The herpes cell change under a microscope is pretty obvious to the lab and doesn’t look like hpv or any of that. My bloodwork showed positive for GHSV about a month later. My pap with the herpes indication was suspected to be my first OB so it took a little bit for my antibodies to climb. 

You should request bloodwork to check. I’m honestly surprised your OBGYN would dismiss that on your pap and not look into further work up to rule it out.",2022-03-15 11:24:43,2
tejbcv,Maybe you’re confusing hsv and hpv? Pap smears are done to check for human papilloma virus (hpv) which is the leading cause of cervical cancer.,2022-03-15 17:50:37,1
tejbcv,"I would wait a couple months and then get a herpes IGG test, it takes some time for antibodies to form after you contract herpes (in case this was a first outbreak which in your case you probably don't know)

If you went a week later and they didn't see anything it's possible it was because your outbreak healed already, people can have internal outbreaks and not realize it",2022-03-15 17:03:06,1
tejbcv,I am not sure but it was not me thank you for sharing !!! I am freaking out but thank you.. I appreciate it!,2022-03-15 14:55:43,5
tejbcv,So first swabbed showed a possible positive? And then when you went back it was negative ?,2022-03-15 16:25:16,1
tejbcv,Sorry for so many questions but was it a Pap smear?,2022-03-15 16:26:07,1
tejbcv,Never have I had any sort of out break & I also had BV & yeast infection. I did scratch for a day n Still there was no out break. & when I went to planned parenthood I showed her my results from my obgyn n she told me that I wasn’t specifically tested for it and she said from what I explained it doesn’t even sound like an outbreak :/,2022-03-15 16:44:12,1
tejbcv,It was no more than a week later that I got another Pap smear at planned parenthood and the provider  checked for any sore blisters or signs of blisters and she told me I was completely clear that’s why I was super confused.. and I agree my doctor was no help.. answered none of my questions..,2022-03-15 11:34:03,2
tejbcv,"Your blood work doesn’t show ghsv , it will only show hsv 1 or hsv2 .  It will not actually show ghsv which is just the location of the hsv. 

Did the pap smear tell you which OB you were having. Problem I have read is a pap would only be able to identify hsv is it happened to be performed when you were having an actual OB or a time of viral shedding ( which isn’t continuous ).",2022-03-15 13:48:22,0

Im very pro health advocacy and you know yourself best. I hope you get answers and I know it’s easier for me to say it but really, try not to stress. Bloodwork for peace of mind.

For peace of mind for sure.",2022-03-15 13:54:52,4
tejbcv,"It’s not difficult to put two and two together when the positive hsv2 in my bloodwork coincided with herpes cells in Pap smear along with a subsequent external OB…

I’ve had ghsv2 for nearly 10 years. So I’m pretty secure in knowing the type I have with how it presented and how it was diagnosed.

Edit to add: I am sharing my experience. My experience and steps for testing may not be everyone’s experience. But this is how I found out and because of that, I’m sharing for awareness.",2022-03-15 13:50:15,4
tejbcv,"Yep mine healed in a few days 

I'd wait at least 2 to 3 months from the pap to get a blood test, anything before 3 months will likely result in a false negative",2022-03-15 17:45:44,1
tejbcv,My doctor doesn’t want to send me to get blood work /: she said come back IF I have a flare up or break out. She said that there’s no proper blood work for it.,2022-03-15 21:20:54,1
tejbcv,"Ghsv can be either Hsv1 or 2.  Some people do not realise that both strains can effect both oral or genital areas so it’s good to be clear on what you are referring to. 
And you didn’t actually say you had tested positive for hsv2 you said ghsv.  You may know what you have and are referring to but others who are just finding out they are positive or potentially positive do not.",2022-03-15 14:03:15,1
tejbcv,Yeah my doctor doesn’t want to send me for blood work she said to come back to the doctor’s IF I have a flair up or outbreak..,2022-03-15 21:20:11,1
tejbcv,"Honestly specifying type 1 vs 2 genitally in my comment is a moot point. Regardless of type, herpes cells are herpes cells if they are on the cervix, there is a high likelihood of having a form of GHSV because the cervix is in your genitals. Therefore additional testing is the next step that makes to most sense to confirm if it is actually cells from ghsv and if it’s type 1 or 2.",2022-03-15 14:09:58,3
tejbcv,Wow. Did you see the physical report from your pap where it states the suspicions of HSV? I’d be finding another doctor. They should not refuse that test.,2022-03-15 21:22:24,1
tejbcv,"Yea medical professionals love letting you live in an ""ignorance is bliss"" state when it comes to herpes 

Wait for about 12 weeks from the pap and go to a STD testing center, Planned Parenthood or whatever you have available where you live that doesn't require your doctor's referral. Get tested. You'll have peace of mind and it'll be good to do it to protect future partners


Edit to add : while blood work(antibody tests- IGG) for herpes can sometimes miss infections it's better than not getting tested at all",2022-03-15 21:25:02,1
tejbcv,"So to clarify. My order of diagnosis was 

Suspicious HSV cells on pap >bloodwork: HSV1 negative, HSV2 equivocal >repeats labs several weeks later HSV1 negative, HSV2 positive igg 8.60 >subsequent first visible external outbreak after positive labs several weeks later.  = GHSV2",2022-03-15 14:38:04,2
tejbcv,Yeah I’m pretty upset! And I am going Thursday to get a copy of all my medical records and switching doctors because how could you allow your patient to be overwhelmed and confused..,2022-03-15 21:37:06,2
tejbcv,That’s a good idea I’m going to look for places I can get tested with out my doctors referral I also want to know so I can let my last partner know so he can make the right choices as well and be safe..,2022-03-15 21:38:28,2
tejbcv,"So your positive for HSV2. They did the igG test.

** sorry, thought your response was from OP **",2022-03-15 16:16:47,3
tejbcv,"You can also order tests online at let'sgetchecked or stdcheck whichever one is available in your country, and you just go to a lab to have them draw the blood",2022-03-15 21:58:27,2
tejbcv,"Yes. In my original comment I mentioned that the first notification of having HSV was because of the pap results saying present HSV cells. That was the start of my diagnosis. My blood tests then confirmed that it was hsv2. So I am diagnosed with GHSV2 and the first indicator of this was because my pap showed the cells at the time of my swab. The repeat labs being equivocal the first round and then showing an igg at 8.60 for hsv2 is indicative of me having my first outbreak at the time of my pap and then it took about a month or so for enough antibodies to register on my 2nd round of bloodwork. 

This was a routine pap that I did annually along with my normal STD testing.",2022-03-15 16:23:15,3
tejbcv,Interesting. I would have never though they could do that during a Pap smear. Always good to learn new things!,2022-03-15 16:24:41,2
tejbcv,"Oh they don’t look for it but when there are changes or abnormal findings the person running the results will make note of it. So to just clarify, Paps are primarily a screening tool to detect hpv and cervical cancers. It just so happened to be my luck the I had HSV and it was like “hey you see me over here too, right!?”",2022-03-15 16:28:37,3
tejbcv,"A, i see. 
Even more interesting. Hell, if it wasn’t for the blood I would have never known I had HSV.",2022-03-15 16:34:41,2
tejbcv,Right! That’s why it’s wild that it’s not a part of routine testing. My husband gets tested annually and they always give him a hard time when he requests it. He only can by telling them that his spouse has diagnosed gHSV2 and that he’s exposed to it regularly.,2022-03-15 16:37:04,2
tekrof,"A dry rash isn’t conclusive to HSV. HSV wouldn’t cause a dry rash. 

Also you need to retest approx 12 weeks after exposure to rule out HSV. I would suggest you stop having sex with your partner who is HSV2+ if your scared to catch HSV.",2022-03-15 11:05:19,1
tehcpd,Just be honest,2022-03-15 13:31:49,2
tehcpd,"Me ! And I’m so nervous to tell him. I (21f) was diagnosed with ghsv 1 end of January 2022. Me and him (22) broke up oct 2020 and got back in touch august 2021 seeing each other every so often, very casual. 
He was my 2nd body and the person who gave it to me was my 4th. I last saw him in December and he’s messaged me multiple times in the last few months to meet up to which I’ve made excuses every time as I am nervous to disclose to him. I know he won’t be disgusted but I am scared he may not want to see me again and whatever casual to a potentially serious relationship will be over.",2022-03-16 14:24:45,2
tenkyq,Is he even at risk ?  Does he actually know his hsv status ?,2022-03-15 13:40:24,2
tenkyq,"Terri Warren on her blog says that most people with GHSV-1after 2 years will asymptomaticly shed the viral for 4 days... 

I would think at that point, taking antivirals is pretty overkill since even on those 4 days, your body has an extremely low chance of producing a virus strong enough to even infect or transmit.

I expect the mod will eventually answer your post soon with the link to the forum post where Terri Warren states this. I forgot to save it. 😅",2022-03-15 14:04:53,2
tenkyq,I am guy with ghsv1 also. I have boyfriend. We been together with my boyfriend over 1 year. We dont have condom during oral and my bf doesnt want To use condoms anymore In sex. So far I havent transmitted it yet. I dont take meds either.,2022-03-15 21:10:05,2
tenkyq,"I told him I would need him to get tested before we did anything unprotected, and he gladly agreed. As far as I understand it, doctors won’t test for HSV unless you have a breakout or you ask a bunch of times for a blood test.",2022-03-15 20:50:57,3
tenkyq,"1) 4 days a year? 
2) You can pass it on while asympomaticly shedding, correct?",2022-03-15 20:54:18,1

tehlsl,"I'm going to paste nearly verbatim what I wrote to a woman earlier this week.

It's important to know which strain he has because if it's HSV1 you very well likely have it and will be protected from ever getting it genitally (2/3 of the population has HSV1 or oral herpes). I am going to assume it's HSV2, but if it's HSV1, the rates of transmission are MUCH lower.

I'm a 29M and have had HSV2 for over three years. HSV2 commonly affects the genitals but can be oral as well; HSV1, while preferring the mouth, is responsible for up to half of new genital herpes infections. I've had a total of four outbreaks (all in the first year). I haven't had any outbreaks since. This is how it is even for a vast majority of people that get this. Over 80% of people that contract HSV2 NEVER have ANY symptoms and are out there spreading this because they have no idea they have it. An estimated 1/6 Americans have HSV2.  For those who have symptoms at first, the outbreaks decrease with severity and amount and eventually will cease entirely. Most of the horror stories on here are the exception, not the rule - I would say probably 5-10% of the people who get herpes are likely immunocompromised and suffer recurrent outbreaks - which can easily be managed with antivirals. It is, as is often described, a skin infection - one that doesn't decrease your lifespan or really affect your ability to have children (neonatal herpes being passed through childbirth is 3 times less likely than you giving birth to a child with down syndrome).

Having this myself, I can say that this is NOT a big deal at all and I do not get the stigma surrounding it. That's really the only problem IMO about having this - others' assumptions and stereotypes about the infection. I will say this - of course, for a guy, the symptoms aren't as painful because if we do get sores, they tend to be outside versus inside. It's very possible you already have it or HSV1. Ironically, if this guy ONLY has HSV2 and didn't ever have HSV1 and you did, YOU could have given him genital herpes. I am in this boat, I tested negative for HSV1 when I got tested a few months back for my HSV negative partner.

If you all have 2-3 sex acts per week, there is about a 10% chance of you acquiring the virus in a given year (this is without protection). Again, if you contract it - there is an over 80% chance you never get ANY symptoms. Daily antivirals reduce the chances to about 5% per year. Condoms, conservatively, reduce the chances by another 50%; however there is research by Teri Warren that shows condom use may reduce transmission rates from M to F by up to 96%. Conservatively, the use of antivirals AND condoms will result in a 2.5% yearly chance - but we may be talking well under 1% due to condom use with antivirals. Oral with HSV2 is generally safe as it does not like the mouth area, but is still possible (but under 1%); use a condom at first if you're not comfortable. Also, the longer he has it, the less he sheds the virus. If he's asymptomatic (doesn't have outbreaks anymore) this also leads to a reduction in overall shedding. People without symptoms shed less on average than those that still get outbreaks. Asymptomatic shedding (with no sores) IS responsible for up to 70% of transmissions, so YES, that IS possible, but again, this is hindered by taking daily antivirals and condoms.

The vast majority of us on here that got it (90%+) was NOT from someone who disclosed and was honest with us; it was from someone who didn't know they had it OR KNEW AND LIED/NEVER TOLD. I was in the second boat; my ex-girlfriend knew she had it and didn't tell me out of fear I would have rejected her. If she had told me, I would have not have rejected her; her being honest with me and showing me all the precautions would have been a massive green flag for me and by taking those precautions I VERY LIKELY would not have it today.

For the few that have contracted it after taking the risk and when given the choice, the anecdotes I've seen from people is that they didn't contract it until years into the relationship - which at that point I would imagine most people are happily married and don't care anymore.

This guy is presumably looking for a long-term relationship and by telling you this is communicating his desire to be honest with you, even with the chance that you turn him down as a result. Clearly, he's not looking to lie to you or mislead for the possibility of cheap sex; so many people pass this on or lie about it just to get laid. Consider that a MASSIVE GREEN FLAG.

Still, if you're hesitant, I recommend taking it slow with him and getting to know if you two are compatible. Sex is good, sex is great; but I'm taking it slow with a woman who is HSV negative right now because I desire so much more. Sounds like he does too.

***PS - You just said you want to remain celibate until marriage? Sounds like this decision is all the easier for you. You're not risking anything till then, at which point you should know whether or not this is the guy for you.***",2022-03-15 14:01:07,2
tehlsl,Do you know which *type* of genital herpes your guy has? Genital herpes comes in two types: hsv1 or hsv2. The type of genital herpes that a person has plays a big role in the degree of transmission risk there will be.,2022-03-15 06:38:42,1
tehlsl,"I'm so touched that you took the time to write such a thought-out comment (even if it was mostly pasted from an earlier one as you said). This is exactly the sort of information/advice that I was looking for. 

My boyfriend told me to take as much time as I needed to come to a decision, but after a day of researching what it's all about, I'm actually feeling more hopeful than I thought I would be. I think a lot of my distress about the situation came from the stigma surrounding herpes and STDs in general and less about the facts. I think that if he or someone else is the guy for me, then herpes isn't a dealbreaker. It might be a little less than ideal, but don't we all have less-than-ideal bodies that we just learn how to take care of? 

I'm so glad you pointed out that his honesty is a huge green flag because that's how I'm feeling right now too :) We're meeting up tonight to talk things over so I may re-visit this post to give an update",2022-03-15 22:11:48,2

te6qqr,"It's very, very, very frustrating. In the UK we have basically no access to the Western Blot. I've spent a lot of money trying different tests and many hours researching what my options are. So, although this has no doubt been extremely stressful for you, please spare a thought for those of us in your position who are basically screwed and can't even get the Western Blot. 

I got so far as sending off for the kit, organising fedex (a nightmare given they don't even give you an idea of pick up times and the package is time/temperature sensitive), travelled 2 hours to the only lab I could find that would draw and spin my blood... only to get there and find out after I had had my blood taken that they wouldn't sign the request form (despite having told me they would!). I spent the next hour in a doctor's office trying to tell him, that no I did not have HIV, I was trying to access the Western Blot for HSV! When he eventually understood what I was doing there, he rang his lab over the phone and was told after much discussion that the IgG is in fact a Western Blot. So, confused by this given that my understanding was that Washington was the only place for the WB, but somewhat relieved, he convinced me to do the test through them, which was another couple hundred at least. The results came back a day later (first sign it can't have been the WB since the WB takes time) and it was the exact same lab company and test I had used previously. Such a massive, massive waste of time and money. I'd estimate I've easily spent over £500 at this point on tests, packing materials, transport, doctors/blood draw and I'm no closer to an answer. If I do successfully get the WB arranged I'll be closer to £1000.

I totally get what you mean about how hard it is reaching out to the medical profession. They often come from such a strident, knowledgeable background that they can't possibly accept the Western Blot even exists, let alone that its useful. It doesn't seem to fit within their paradigm of working so they write it off. It boggles my mind that the gold standard isn't available the world over - even the UW medical centre states in the letters they give you to pass on to the medical practitioners/sample collectors that their test can be ordered from their website for use in labs. Yet no one; not one single organisation or company has done this tp my knowledge.

te6qqr,Is the western blot test by blood or swab?,2022-03-15 01:46:37,1
te6qqr,"I have GHSV-1 and while I haven't disclosed to an immediate potential sexual partner yet, part of it would include saying that if they wanted to know if they already had HSV-1, they could get tested. But with the unreliability of the blood tests in both directions, part of me wonders the point of even putting them through that. I would want to encourage the Western Blot (IF they wanted to get tested - their choice if they'd rather not know).

How did you go about getting it eventually, and how much did it cost?

I am also worried about quoting all the stats and research that I'm pretty sure used seropositivity as a metric for estimating the rate of both types of herpes. Those metrics could be wildly over- or underestimated, right? Or are western blots used in that kind of research? They should be...",2022-03-15 01:47:35,1

That’s just not something I can get behind.

I’m only supportive of individuals obtaining this therapy via a prescription through their doctor after all other treatment avenues have failed.

Making medication, especially an experimental one, is very dangerous. The chances of making the medication incorrectly or applying it incorrectly is very likely. In my opinion, SADBE therapy needs to be directed by a doctor, preferably a dermatologist who already prescribes it for HPV.

tejb0i,valtrex suddenly stopped working as great for me as well out of no where. currently on week 7 of SADBE. I think you’re on the right path seeking SADBE. if you can’t get it through the VA go see a regular/private dermatologist and pay cash price a cash price co pay is about $75-100 for the visit. and it’ll be worth it.,2022-03-15 16:24:25,1
tejb0i,">I’ve had oral hsv my entire life, and spread it to my own genitals accidentally with some intense self-love a year or so ago.

Have you had your genital symptoms swab tested and confirmed as being herpes? Because transmitting to oneself in the manner you described, after already having an oral infection for years, is exceptionally unlikely. Not impossible but very exceptionally unlikely.

>I take half a g of Valtrex daily but I still have outbreaks several times a year ... I’m wondering WHY this might be happening.

For suppression using Valtrex/valacyclovir, people are typically started at 500mg/day, but if they still experience outbreaks at that dose they are bumped to 1000mg/day.

So I would suggest you do that if your genital symptoms have been confirmed as being herpes. If they haven't then I would wait for the next occurrence and get them swab tested.",2022-03-15 09:34:24,0

No swab for either. No plans to get swabbed because the VA is detrimental to my mental health and they’re my only option.

tehzdg,"It can be passes orally as well. Condoms do protect against it, but only do so much depending on whether or not they're having an outbreak. They also make protection for oral sex as well. Essentially if they're having an outbreak it's kind of a no contact deal. Like let's say if it were orally and someone had a cold sore, it'd simply mean no kissing until its healed up. A lot of people don't even realize they have it because it stays dormant for a lot of people and they're typically asymptomatic. Some people have outbreaks and brush it off not thinking anything of it. There's also the instances of children being kissed by an adult as a child and accidentally passing it onto the child. So in the event it did come from you and you guys have never done anything with each other or anyone else that could be possible. Thats about the best summary i can give you there's plenty of other and better explained information out there as well..

I've had it almost 20 years, and it's not dormant. I take Valtrex, too. You need to educate yourself. Herpes never goes ""dormant"" and the possibility of transmission is always there. You've had it a ""couple of years"" - you are shedding 13.1% of days without counting outbreaks. If you include outbreaks if you have them, it's 20.6% of days. 

Yes, Valtrex reduces transmission, but you are not ""dormant"".

Total HSV shedding occurred on 33.6% of days in participants <1 year, 20.6% in those 1–9 years, and 16.7% in those ≥10 years from first episode. Subclinical HSV shedding occurred on 26.2% of days among participants <1 year, 13.1% in those 1–9 years, and 9.3% in those ≥10 years from first episode. On days with HSV detection, mean quantity was 4.9 log10 copies/mL for those <1 year, 4.7 log10 copies/mL among those 1–9 years, and 4.6 log10 copies/mL among those ≥10 years since first episode.  
Conclusions. Rates of total and subclinical HSV-2 shedding decrease after the first year following the initial clinical episode. However, viral shedding persists at high rates and copy numbers years after infection, and therefore may pose continued risk of HSV-2 transmission to sexual partners.""

That doesn't mean you aren't still shedding. Remember that the vast majority of exposures to asymptomatic shedding don't actually result in transmission. For asymptomatic transmission to occur, several things need to happen just right. Asymptomatic shedding makes transmission possible but certainly doesn't guarantee it.

So, u/GenoFlower's comment is most likely correct. If you have genital hsv2 then, no matter whether you still get outbreaks or not, it is highly likely that you still periodically shed virus.",2022-03-15 05:54:00,1
te0dy8,"Hsv1 spreads more because of oral hsv1, which sheds a lot more than ghsv1.

When you hear the numbers for hsv1 - currently at 67% for people under 50 globally - it includes oral hsv1.

All we have are studies. We can't all assume that we are shedding less than what the studies say. And we all shed. I don't understand what is so hard to grasp here.

We definitely don't always shed to a level that infects someone else. We don't even know what that level is. We do know transmission stats for ghsv2, though, and if we always shed at high rates, we'd be infecting at higher rates.

I don't mean to make anyone feel like a walking biohazard. I certainly don't feel that way. We do have to accept the risk, though.

Edited to add - I wouldn't worry about a risk for oral hsv2 at all, by the way, which is where this whole thing started, unless someone was having an outbreak.",2022-03-16 04:45:20,1

te0dy8,">If she has herpes anally and I want to go down on her (🐱) would I get it orally or would I have to actively touch a sore?

If your partner has a genital herpes infection and you were to catch it when you perform oral sex on her, then that would result in you having an oral herpes infection, yes. But unless she has an active outbreak at the time you perform oral sex, the likelihood of you catching it via oral sex would be *very* low. 

Both kinds of genital herpes, genital hsv1 and genital hsv2, post a very low risk of genital-to-oral transmission if no outbreak is present.

Genital hsv1 poses a very low risk of genital-to-oral transmission outside of an active outbreak because genital hsv1 is one of the least active kinds of herpes there is. It very rarely sheds asymptomatically (ie very rarely becomes active on the skin surface without causing actual visible symptoms). Then add to that the fact that the vast majority of exposures to asymptomatic shedding don't result in transmission *anyway*, and you can see the risk is very low. Genital hsv1 poses a very low risk of genital-to-*genital* transmission outside of active outbreaks for the same reason.

Genital hsv2, meanwhile, asymptomatically sheds considerably more frequently than genital hsv1. But hsv2 has a very strong preference for the genital region. Even when it is given the opportunity to infect orally it usually doesn't bother. Oral hsv2 is fairly uncommon.

I would also point out that if your partner gets outbreaks on her anus, that still means that she has genital herpes. When a person has genital herpes then, *regardless* of where they experience their outbreaks, they will still periodically shed virus from their genital tract -- which for women means the labia, vagina, cervix and anus.

That being said, genital hsv1 is one of the last active kinds of herpes there is. It rarely sheds in the absence of symptoms, and the vast majority of exposures to asymptomatic shedding don't result in transmission anyway. So you'd be looking at a *very* small degree of risk here. 

And be aware that if you already happen to have oral hsv1 yourself then you'd be at no practical risk from a partner's genital hsv1 infection at all. You would already have hsv1 antibodies.

You also asked:

>If i did get it but have no symptoms should I take medicine or just let it run it’s coarse?

That would depend on your reason for taking the medication. Medication can be used to treat an active outbreak, to minimize outbreak extent and speed healing. But if you're not having an outbreak then that wouldn't be applicable.

Medication can also be taking on a ongoing daily basis to:

* reduce outbreak frequency, and/or

* to reduce the risk of asymptomatically transmitting to a partner",2022-03-17 10:15:13,1

te0dy8,">it’s pretty dormant at this point

I need to clarify how I interpreted this statement, apparently. 

Dormant means inactive, or inactivity, right? Medically, it means inactive, but not cured. 

If you are shedding, it isn't inactive. It's not dormant. 

You can shed, and not infect your partner. As in the study I posted above, shedding isn't 24/7, and as we know from transmission studies, transmission isn't guaranteed. You have to have enough virus to transmit, and we don't know how much that takes, or if it's different for each person. 

My former partner was shedding. He had outbreaks, so his herpes was not dormant. 

I just don't want anyone thinking that if they don't get outbreaks for a period of time, they can't transmit. 

A good example of a dormant virus is the chicken pox virus. If you get that, it is dormant in your body, and then later, can reactivate into the shingles. It's actually dormant, though - when you don't have symptoms, you can't transmit it. It's not doing any harm to your body, it's not progressing, it's just there.",2022-03-16 04:38:42,1

Herpes would definitely not cause that. That symptom is most often caused by a bladder infection.

Herpes also wouldn't cause bumps that persist for 6 weeks.

If you're talking about inside your urethra, the most common cause is probably some sort of bacterial infection (which would be consistent with your possible/likely bladder infection -- since bladder infections often start as a UTI, Urinary Tract Infection, that then makes it's way back through the urethra to the bladder and causes an infection there as well), though there may be other possibilities.",2022-03-15 23:06:00,2

tdtgb4,"Having sex with someone who has herpes does not mean they will 100% contract it. There’s ways to be safe and reduce transmission (condoms, antivirals, just monitoring your body… and even time! With time comes less viral shedding and therefore reduces chances of transmission). Since my diagnosis, I have not transmitted hsv to any of my new partners. 

Additionally, 1 out of 6 people have ghsv but the vast majority are asymptomatic. It’s actually more commonly spread by asymptomatic partners since they don’t know they have it and therefore don’t take any precautions! Sometimes sex with someone with herpes who knows their status can be a lot safer than someone who is asymptomatic who doesn’t. For example, I know I’m positive for ghsv2. I take a daily antiviral, vitamins to boost immunity, monitor my body, and use protection when I have sex. I try to make sex as safe for my partner as possible… and open communication is a big part of it too. 

Also if she’s a medical student, she’ll most likely be very understanding. Might as well try. Doesn’t have to be a “forever” relationship. Just because you have herpes doesn’t mean that you can’t still date.",2022-03-15 05:50:30,2

> I began feeling cold symptoms. I blamed it on conjunctivitis and a UTI. Swab test at urgent care proved it was herpes

A first-time herpes outbreak can cause flu-like sypmtoms (eg headache, fever, body-aches, light sensitivity, and swollen lymph nodes near the region of infection) but would not cause symptoms of a cold (eg stuffy/runny nose, cough, sore throat, congestion).

>From what I understand, Valtrex daily combined with the use of condoms makes the possible transmission rate come down to 1.9%

It sounds like you're talking about the transmission risk per *year* based on sex twice per week, but are presenting that stat as if it's the risk per *encounter* (since you didn't specify otherwise). Here are the stats for genital hsv2 transmission, within the constraints stated:

---

**Male-to-Female Ghsv2 transmission risk:**

In studies of couples in long term relationships (ie together at least 3 months already) where the man has genital hsv2 and the woman doesn't and they both know he has it, if they have *unprotected* sex for an entire year (approximately twice per week) except during outbreaks, and the man takes no herpes medication, the woman has about a 10% chance of becoming infected by the end of the year.

Having sex more or less often than twice per week would raise or lower that base figure accordingly. Also note that that base figure comes from studies of couples already in long term relationships, and herpes is slightly more likely to transmit when the partners have been together less than 3 months. We aren't sure exactly *how* much higher the risk is before the 3-month mark, but we know its definitely higher. We also know that herpes is more active when the infection is recent, eg during the first 6-12 months of having it (the decline is gradual).

If the man takes daily herpes medication that would lower the risk to the woman by about 50%, bringing the annual risk from about 10% down to about 5%. Furthermore, condoms have been found to provide women with a very high level of protection from herpes, though not quite complete. One recent large scale study found that condoms reduce male-to-female herpes transmission risk by a further 96%. Herpes expert Terri Warren thinks that might be a *bit* on the high side, but not by much. So consider well over a further 90% reduction. So without condoms or medication, the annual risk to the woman is about 10%. With medication it falls to about 5%. With condoms but no medication it would be about 1%. And with medication *and* condoms it's well under 1%. 

**Female-to-Male Ghsv2 transmission risk:**

If the situation is reversed and it's the woman who has genital hsv2 and the man doesn't and they both know she has it, if they have unprotected sex for an entire year (approximately twice per week) except during outbreaks and the woman takes no herpes medication, the man has a 4% chance of becoming infected by the end of the year.

To reiterate: having sex more or less often than twice per week would raise or lower that base figure accordingly. And that base figure comes from studies of couples already in long term relationships, and herpes is slightly more likely to transmit when the partners have been together less than 3 months, or when the infection is still fairly recent (eg first six months etc).

Condom use and herpes medication would each lower the female-to-male transmission risk by about 50% further from whatever it was before. So if the couple uses condoms *or* the woman takes medication, the annual risk to the man comes down to about 2%. And if they use both, it comes down to about 1%. As you can see, men are at considerably less risk of catching herpes than women when no condoms are used. But men also gain considerably less protection from condoms than do women.",2022-03-14 20:31:25,3
te3xz2,"This is great information. As I said, I was diagnosed last week, so I'm still reviewing facts and asking questions. I'm glad to hear that daily valtrex and the use of  condoms lowers the risk of transmission between female to male even lower than I'd thought. Thanks for the information.",2022-03-14 22:34:34,2

te64qa,">I am on vacation with three friends who have genital herpes. I was wondering if there is any chance of contamination from being in hot tubs with them? Most of what I read says no however some sources say it’s possible

No, that would pose absolutely zero risk. Your mouth or genitals would need to have direct, skin-to-skin contact with their genitals for there to be any potential risk of transmission. And if they don't have an outbreak at the time then the contact would need to be very considerable (ie considerable sustained contact as well as considerable friction) for there to be any risk at all and even then the risk would still be quite low.

If a person has genital herpes then you would basically need to engage in sexual behaviors with them for there to be any potential risk of transmission. Herpes can't be transmitted through water, or inanimate objects (eg a toilet seat, or a shared bar of soap in the shower etc).",2022-03-14 20:36:11,7

te3j9j,"The thing about prodrome symptoms/ or shedding symptoms is that they are usually pretty common things that can happen, muscle aches, itchiness, tingly sensation, etc. so someone who has never had an outbreak may get shedding symptoms and think it’s just something else",2022-03-14 23:40:26,1
te3j9j,"Supposedly, it’s one day a month someone asymptomatic would shed. This is how I contracted it too. My partner had OHSV (he didn’t have an active outbreak at the time, and hadn’t in about a year) and gave me oral sex. A few days later I started having symptoms.",2022-03-15 09:01:25,1
te3j9j,I just wonder ages with ghsv1. I got ghsv1 from an asymptomatic first time partner and I also only have sex with women. But just get through your first outbreak and take care of your body and you should be fine! Don’t worry about oral sex causing more outbreaks. It might now feel the same right away you might have to give your body a couple of months to feel back to normal but just communicate with your partner and be patient with yourself.,2022-03-14 22:59:56,1
te3j9j,"Got ya, thanks so much!",2022-03-15 06:27:13,1
te3j9j,I'm fully over my first outbreak now - got a bit scared the other day as started having symptoms but turns out it was a yeast infection 🙄 My body needs to give me a break haha.  Thanks for your advice 😁,2022-03-15 06:28:30,1
tdx8rr,"Can't see what you get out of confronting the person. You're better off without them, and have a good long life in front of you, with a new ""experienced"" mindset and a lovely boyfriend, who is really into you as a person :))!",2022-03-14 14:13:06,4
tdx8rr,"Wow congrats, I had sex with a girl who had herpes but used protected, she said she forgot and told me after we had sex, I’m still scared but it’s been a month and one week with no symptoms 


Yes that persons evil for that, think they just wanted to play with your mind lol but congrats",2022-03-14 13:31:24,1
tdx8rr,Can you share the name of the text you bought and where you got it?? Is it a blood test?,2022-03-14 14:23:29,1
tdx8rr,"Oh crikey… asshole move of her to ‘forget’ but if you used protection I’m sure you’re fine (I mean the chances of it being passed on if she had no symptoms is like 1-2%) 
But that being said IF you’re someone who rly worries about that shit then getting a test online to ease your fears is always an option! The one I got cost me £50 but it was certainly £50 well spent haha",2022-03-14 13:41:19,2
tdx8rr,I had protected sex only once they lasted 2 minutes. Unluckily there was a hole in the condom. A month later i got vaginal sores.. begged him to get a herpes test he refused. Now I’m pretty sure i have it (got tested too soon so i have to wait after 3 months) it n i feel like everything’s ruined.,2022-03-14 15:23:23,1
tdx8rr,"Yeah ofc! It was off a website called ‘letsgetchecked’ and yes it was a blood test!

It’s a rly good system, you ‘activate’ the test, take the sample and send it off all on the same day. I sent mine off on the Friday I think and got my result on Sunday! 

It cost me £50 in the UK i am not sure if they work all around the world but I think they do!",2022-03-14 14:29:03,1
tdx8rr,"Well, it’s actually possible to forget if it doesn’t affect you daily. I forget it all the time when I talk to guys (I work in a pub) and then I remember “oh yeah, I should tell him if we see each other”.
I understand that it sucks getting told after and it could be because of egotistical reasons, but I also think it is possible to just forget. 😅",2022-03-14 15:03:20,4
tdx8rr,"Yeah I was pissed but comforted her when she cried, such nonsense 

Nah I don’t like in Manchester no more, I’m in Australia and the doctors are really good here, literally got 2-3 sti test with no symptoms, including hsv igg",2022-03-14 13:43:12,1
tdx8rr,I don’t see one on there for HSV? Perhaps it’s only available in the UK and not the US??,2022-03-14 14:57:08,2
tdx8rr,Yeah tbh you’re right!! Esp if no symptoms ever acc - I was a bit quick to judge that!,2022-03-14 15:26:56,3
tdx8rr,"You know what I just went on the website and also couldn’t find the one which I had ordered! They do one which tests for everything but it is over £200 (yikes) 

I am not sure if the website has been changed since I ordered mine or if I am just being blind… maybe try in the men’s or women’s health section?",2022-03-14 15:01:35,1
tdx8rr,"I checked there, but couldn’t find it. That’s unfortunate! Ik it can be so difficult to have a doctor do testing so it would have been nice to have something people could easily access themselves!",2022-03-14 15:04:16,1
tdwq9v,"What was your hsv2 result?  And was igm or igg test ?  Low positives can be false positives with Igg. And igm just overall inaccurate and shouldn’t be used.  
And OB best to get swabbed .",2022-03-14 13:27:08,1
tdwq9v,"In latest result. They just mentioned it's negative. No numbers. In December, when j tested first. Right after oral exposure, I started to have lil discomfort in penis top. That discomfort is still there. But no ob.",2022-03-14 16:17:05,1
tdwq9v,It was igg tests. Numbers were 2.5+ for hsv2. I'vent had ob per say.,2022-03-14 15:30:54,1
tdwq9v,"So that was the result from the second test. ?  And the latest test you were under .9 -1.01 ( can’t remember the ranges ). 

When you tested for hsv2 at beginning of december was it because you thought you had been exposed to it ?",2022-03-14 15:53:17,1
te1j9e,"It’s very unlikely to transmit to another location if you both already have it.  Obviously if she’s got an outbreak, it’s more likely to happen.  But don’t have sex with outbreaks.",2022-03-14 16:54:31,3
te1j9e,"If she has ghsv2 and u have hsv 1 it definitely could tranfer 

If u both have hsv2 u should both have antibodies for it",2022-03-14 16:58:33,1
te1j9e,"It can. Definitely. But only if she’s recently diagnosed, or within the time frame of break out. If it’s been dormant for a couple months you should be safe.",2022-03-14 18:22:54,1

te1j9e,I also have hsvg soooo the only thing I gotta look forward 2 is not doing it with a open break in the area,2022-03-14 16:56:40,1
te1j9e,No oral hsv just type 2,2022-03-14 17:02:34,0
te1j9e,Basically yes.  Now things like shaving can cause micro abrasions in the skin and if she’s asymptomaticlly shedding the virus (meaning the virus is active in her cells without a physical outbreak) it could possibly spread. But it’s still unlikely.,2022-03-14 17:02:57,0

te0cpq,"Please clarify which *type* of genital herpes you have (hsv1 or hsv2), as that can affect guidance/advance, resources, and suggestions etc.",2022-03-14 20:21:59,1
te0cpq,"Doctors give out all kinds of weird advice imo. Transmission is different for everyone but it’s best to always disclose. I got it at 19, was in the middle of college, and felt like no one would want to sleep with me again but you’d be surprised with how many people are okay with it when you disclose. As long as you use protection and take medication the rate of transmission is extremely low. As for having a relationship, someone who is really for you and loves you won’t have a problem with it! I know it sounds corny but over time with the virus you learn that to be true.

It’s difficult right now but things get better. You can live a long, happy, and healthy life with ghsv1. What personally helped me was going to my unis caps center and scheduling a therapist appointment. Also, if you feel comfortable doing so, tell someone you trust like a best friend or family member. Its super relieving and comforting to have someone support you irl. 

I’m always here to chat! Keep ur head up",2022-03-18 18:29:26,1
te0cpq,"Hey, I actually have no idea.. The first doctor I went to last Friday told me that there’s no sign of genital herpes. After that the girl I had sex with told me that her doctor said that she’s got herpes (she also had a lot of pain & fever). Now I went to a different doctor yesterday and he said that it is most likely genital herpes and that it would probably be a waste of money to officially test it..",2022-03-15 11:37:44,1

tdvpk5,"In my opinion, she took a risk when she had unprotected sex with you. Yes, you should’ve disclosed but in the heat of the moment it’s hard to bring that up/kill the mood. I probably just would apologize and let her go if she’s that angry with you 😬",2022-03-14 11:58:33,1
tdvpk5,"Yeah, I offered to give any kind of assistance that I could, but the shit already hit the fan and I would be quite angry as well, so maybe to give the distance she needs is the best option.",2022-03-14 13:05:53,1
tdvpk5,"Did she ask for any std results at the time? Not an excuse not to disclose if she didn’t, but if she did that would have been a time to bring it up.",2022-03-14 13:21:26,2
tdvpk5,Definitely distance. Nothing you can really do unfortunately. There will be someone else and you will learn from this mistake. 💕,2022-03-16 23:02:50,1
te00es,I’ve been wondering the same! I did a lot of research on lysine and I read that it works amazing to help clear outbreaks BUT if you take it daily your body begins to depend on it. So if you miss a day or anything you’ll get a bad outbreak. I’m scared of that so I’m still looking around! Also heard red marine algae is good,2022-03-14 18:34:48,2
tdzv0g,"Why don't you disclose your own status to her? In a non-confrontational, comfortable and warm way, so that she may feel comfortable to tell you her status or at least how she feels about it? That'll go over better, I think, than asking her directly if she has it, which might make her feel on-the-spot and not comfortable with the vulnerability of disclosing.",2022-03-14 15:22:52,4

On another note, have you reached out to an adult or someone close to you about the way his mom reacted? a grown woman cannot threaten a minor, and her sons actions are not your fault. 

If he’s the only person you’ve had sex with and you got Hsv2 genitally then it’s pretty clear he gave it to you. I’m sure he knows he had to of given it to you given your sexual history. I would definitely tell him about the chlamydia too so he can get rid of it because you two don’t wanna pass it back and fourth. The fact he’s been dismissive of everything is 🚩 🚩🚩.",2022-03-14 06:44:44,5
tdqiy8,"I’m sorry you’re going through this. 

I got it from the guy I “lost it” to too. I think that’s one of the things that was the hardest for me to come to terms with. I had always said I don’t sleep around cause I was scared of catching something and I got it from this first guy. 

In regards to his mom, is there a trusted adult you can confide in? No adult should be yelling at a teen, let alone threatening to hurt them. Please stay safe.",2022-03-14 06:54:49,3
tdqiy8,"Hey I understand the depression I was depressed for years until I finally decided enough was enough. I have been diagnosed for 10 years and have had  20+ partners since diagnosis. None of them to their knowledge have genital herpes some had cold sores. I am currently with a guy who is completely HSV negative he works at a blood lab and took a test just for shits and giggles.  He knows about my herpes I disclosed and he is completely fine with it and accepts the risks. There are plenty of people like this who do not care. Sitting around and waiting for a cure it’s silly you’re rejecting yourself before anyone even has a chance to think about it or reject you or accept you. You are putting limits on yourself before giving anyone else the opportunity to consider anything. People get rejected every day for a plethora of different reasons Sure there are people who ghosted me especially on tinder but as I talked to my friends I realized they got ghosted too and it wasn’t because of herpes it was because dating apps are cesspools in general. Dating nowadays sucks for so many reasons if you want to pin it on herpes go for it but that’s not the only reason. I was diagnosed with ghsv-1 at 19 and I thought my life was over I didn’t tell a soul cut off friends and everything because I felt so disgusting and gross. But eventually I put myself out there and had a few positive disclosure s and i began to realize that I was the one creating the stigma for myself.. The more people I told the less it weighted me down. Think of it logically friends should care because it doesn’t effect them. The only people your herpes effects are the people you are sleeping With. Friends are supposed to be your support system and if you tell them your story they should not judge you And they will learn from you And your experience. Hell you May even help a fellow herpes person out becuase if someone discloses to your friend after you teach them about herpes they will be more understanding and knowledgeable about it. But that’s up to you. I’ll attach some links that have seemed to help people and if you need anything please dm me.I’ve had it for almost a decade at this point and have a pretty good handle on it.

This first link is info about a support group I’m in. All herpes people from all over the world we all share are experiences, vent , swap info and remedies, and just talk about life it’s an awesome place to be for sure.

tdqiy8,"It takes a while to get over I’m not gonna lie but it does get better with time, I promise. Do your research and it becomes less intimidating. As far as outbreaks go. I’m in daily antivirals, they decrease the risk of outbreaks and the risk of transmission. I use a spray called Dermaplast when I get outbreaks. You can find it in the pharmacy aisle, it helps numb things. Drink lots of water and having a healthy diet is good too. You’ll learn your triggers and how to manage it. You can also find @suzbubs on tiktok. She’s an advocate for herpes positive people and has really helped me accept my status. I’d steer clear of her comment section at first though because people can be mean; but she has very good videos.",2022-03-14 13:08:03,1

tdqiy8,"21F here. Definitely find out what strain you have. If he goes and gets tested and doesn’t specifically ask to be tested for type 1, it’s very very possible that they will not test him for type 1. In that case, he might assume that he’s negative. Id reach out to a trusted adult or friend. Start taking some supplements and maybe a daily antiviral if that’s something that you are comfortable with. I take 1g valacyclovir daily, lysine, red marine algae, and just some vitamins like vitamin c. I know that this can feel like the end of the world, but it really isn’t. HSV is so common, and so many people don’t even care. The stigma is the worst part, but when educate people on the virus they will most likely be accepting.

If you do have it, I promise you it’s not the end of the world, not the end of your sex/dating life and so many people have the virus. Educate yourself, knowledge is 100% power and the stigmas that come with HSV are far worst for most than the actual virus itself.",2022-03-14 10:40:22,2

And I am 32 and I prefer being single, doing causal dating and hookups. I really don't see myself ever really getting a partner because I prefer being single.

When I was first being diagnosed, I had like 6 sex partners at the time and two of them told me, ""well, here's your sign to get a life partner.""

#FUCK THAT.

tddbo9,That’s what I told them when I disclosed my status to my friends and it seemed like they understood?

Just weird and came out of left field for me.,2022-03-13 18:51:37,3
tddbo9,"Yeah—I’m a very slutty person lol. 

I disclose to my partners, depending on the activity (I’m a queer AFAB person, and I top, so often my pants stay on or I use a strap, and there’s no risk of transmission of GHSV in many circumstances). 

But I’ve had at least 10 partners in the year since I’ve been diagnosed. 

You can date casually. You can have casual sex—there are so many options for ways to ethically have sex and relationships post-diagnosis.

HSV doesn’t mean you’re on the shelf or need to settle down. 

It means you need to practice safer sex, inform your partners, have good communication, and take charge of your own health so that you know when you’re safe to play and when you might not be (or so you can help make sure everyone involved knows what the risks are) 

Just bear in mind that being positive for HSV means you’re at an increased risk for contracting HIV from an HIV pos partner—so make sure everyone is tested regularly and to use condoms where necessary. 

If you know your partner is HIV+ get on PrEP and make sure their counts are low—U=U.

I definitely agree with the other comments that it happens regardless to people which is hard to remember when something in your brain in bright letters is telling you that this disease is the reason. And it becomes the reason why some of us ultimately are unable to accept ourselves because a romantic partner won’t. 

This is a slippery slope friend. I was in a very similar situation to you and I definitely don’t have the answers and feel the ups and downs of the emotional/mental impact frequently. But honestly time and surrounding yourself with a good support system (whether anonymously online or in person friends) is a great way to start healing. it helps you remember to also live your life like a normal person most of the time, which is what we are! we have baggage just like anyone else- yea maybe it’s heavier but we’ll just have to find some strong people 😉

You did the right thing and disclosed to him the least he could do is tell you that he’s not interested.

I would think that someone would genuinely want to know and not blow you off when you tried to tell them—I think that’s suspicious. 

I just know that the person I definitely got it from (I had a primary outbreak), acted oblivious. 

I’ve wondered about whether he genuinely didn’t know—and struggled with being angry myself. 

I waffle on whether he knew and was just acting clueless (something that seems like the kind of bullshit he’d do, honestly, knowing this guy) or whether he genuinely just wasn’t that aware of his own health and what was going on with his body. 

All that to say—I completely understand being angry.

But sometimes I wonder how cut and dried it is for the people who pass this virus on—I know that the vast majority of people who are spreading HSV are not aware that they have it at all.

ETA: I completely understand being angry with people who are fully aware they are HSV pos and don’t disclose—I feel that disclosure is necessary for informed, enthusiastic consent. 

If you know, imo, disclosure is a must.

Could you please clarify how you were tested? Ie swab test or blood test? If it was a blood test, was it an IgG test? And, if so, what was your hsv2 index value?

tdolir,03/07 Pcr vagina swab my OB took some sample from the sores in my tight,2022-03-14 11:14:02,1
tdolir,">OB took some sample from the sores in my tight

You used that word ""tight"" several times. Did you mean to say *thigh*? Are you saying that you had some sores on your thigh? 

Regardless, positive swab results are very highly reliable so it *does* appear that you have hsv2. 

>I was abused and he used to put his penis in my vagina. It’s possible it was herpes all this time? I was abused when I was 5 or 6 approx. I’m married (8 years, together 9) my husband just asked how and said he is in shock. I’m just overwhelmed with everything and the though of this being from the person who abused me just make it worse. 

First of all, a herpes diagnosis can often come as a shock. So give yourself permission to need some time to process this and learn about the condition.

Without knowing more about your situation it is extremely difficult to know the source of your infection. In some cases, it is *impossible* to know the source of one's infection. You said that you were abused when you were 5-6, but you didn't say whether you'd had any consensual sexual encounters with anyone other than your husband. It could have come from *any* of your past sexual encounters.  There's also a chance it could have come from your husband. Herpes is less contagious than most people realize and some couples, where one partner has it but doesn't know, can be sexually active for years before transmission occurs.

You said:

> I mentioned her that I had a itching in my tight that I had a long time without having them.

And it isn't clear what you meant. Are you saying that you've experienced very similar itching and sores like this previously? If so, how approximately how many times has this occurred? And how far back do you remember this occurring?

The best course of action would be for your husband to get blood tested to see whether he has hsv2 himself. If he does then there would be no need for the two of you to engage in any precautions when having sex together since you both already have it. But that wouldn't necessarily clarify whether he is the source of your infection or whether he caught it from you.",2022-03-14 20:16:23,2
tdolir,"First of all, sorry for this messy post. I have so much in my head and tried to do a Yes, and I meant thigh. English is not my first language. Sorry about any other mistake.

I never associated it with herpes since I didn't have intercourse or other sexual activity until almost 20. I told my husband to get tested.

tdjkrq,">Now I'm wondering if I can get an outbreak down there from simply having HSV-1.

No, an oral hsv1 infection would be limited to causing symptoms on the face. For symptoms to occur genitally, the genitals themselves would need to be infected. And it is very unlikely that your genitals have been infected with hsv1, given how long you've had oral hsv1 for.

Once you are infected with a type of herpes in one location, you become largely protected from getting infected with the same type of herpes in another location at a later point in time, whether by spreading an existing infection on yourself, or getting exposed to a partner's infection. This is because after you are infected with herpes, your body creates antibodies to fight the virus. Your body maintains these antibodies in your bloodstream and they protect you from further infection. Different people generate antibodies at different rates, but by about 4 months post-infection the vast majority of people will have enough antibodies to prevent any further infection by the same type. Many people will have sufficient antibodies a lot sooner than that (eg after several weeks).

There are very rare exceptions to the above but that is the general rule.",2022-03-14 03:49:07,2

should be avoided completely until better ones are available. Many
clinicians don’t realize that the IgM test is not good for diagnosing
people, and tell people, based on an IgM test, that they have herpes.
And not only that, they tell them they have a new herpes infection
because IgM, with other viruses, comes up early in infection. But
with herpes, IgG and IgM come up around the same time. The IgM
can be generated years after first infection and will be detectable
periodically. There are also commonly false positives on the IgM
test. A person might have an IgM test and four months later, still
be IgG negative. The IgG is the only test you ever want for herpes,
never ever IgM

So basically lots of false negatives, tons of false positives, plus the type-specificity of the test isn't reliable either. Basically, nothing reliable can be concluded about a person's herpes status based on their IgM results -- no matter whether they test positive or negative.",2022-03-14 21:11:04,2
tdn9pg,">>So you've seen us say that the IgM is not an accurate test and should not be used for herpes detection, but you're asking us about the accuracy of your IgM test and whether it detected herpes?

>Yup exactly! Thanks for your input. Was looking for more of a substantiated response with maybe examples from personal experience. If you don’t have one that’s fine. I hope your day gets better.

If you want my day to get better then please stop wasting sub resources, and also stop with the passive-aggressive behavior. Both of those things would go a long way to improving my day. In the meantime, you're hereby suspended from the sub for 1 week.

tdikac,"Non-present transmission is called viral shedding and most DEFINITELY can happen. Recently a girl who I really cared for and I had unprotected sex quite a bit over the span of a 3 day weekend around 2/27. I had no idea that I was a carrier and WISH that I would have known because I passed this all off to her and now she isn't speaking to me and is unfortunately in quite a depressive state of mind. I had never had any lesions, bumps, cold sores or even had the typical 'first OB' cold flu symptoms to my knowledge. Before her, I had taken quite a lengthy break from relationships and sex due to quite a toxic relationship (2016 timeframe) and my last blood test was around 2019 when I had an appendicitis which all came negative for whatever it was that they tested. They said it was a STD/STI test. I don't even really remember much because I was hopped up on drugs from surgery but I do remember the conversation happening and I made a dumb joke like, "" Oh thank god that can be the last of my worries then. "" So I don't even know where the hell I got it from, I could have gotten it when I was younger and it stayed dormant, a past relationship many years ago.. I still often find myself getting a little frustrated at not knowing who or when it was passed off to me.

Her and I both had an OB at the same time, hers was most certainly worst and more painful for her.

I would 1000% ALWAYS disclose that you have it no matter what because you have no idea how HSV will effect the other person. ESPECIALLY if you care for them you do not want something like this to spontaneously occur in the middle of your growing relationship and then have them get mad, upset and get sent into a depressive state of mind. Please disclose, let them know but don't just say something like, "" I have herpes "". You've gotta go into with confidence, show some study links and link some youtube videos that talk about HSV and the stigmas. If someone is worth your time they will educate themselves, look into it and most likely be okay with it since so many people have HSV in some way shape or form.

Put yourself in that person's shoes, this could be a deal breaker for some ( even though it shouldn't ) and imagine how much more damage it might bring an early relationship versus just being up front a few dates into the relationship before actual major commitment happens.

I've been struggling with my diagnosis quite a bit these past two weeks and bookmarked quite a few videos for if she ever does end up wanting to talk about all of this and these links definitely helped me stress a little less over all of this.

Months 1-3: 13%

Months 3-12: 7%

Months 12-24: 3%-5%

Months 24<: 1.01%

These are the viral shedding rates of GHSV-1.

It can be assumed or inferred that between months 12-24 and on, that possible transmission will be under 1%. And that it is just so fucking rare for it to be transmitted to a partner.",2022-03-14 04:11:35,3

tdikac,Not to be rude or anything but how do you know for sure she didn’t pass it to you? You just said you didn’t have an outbreak until after her. It’s a chance you did pass it to her but their is an equivalent chance that she carried it without knowing as well.,2022-03-14 03:14:36,1

tdikac,"I was just visually diagnosed by an ER Doctor, she looked down there and said yeah that's definitely herpes and then my general practitioner looked and agreed as well, they didn't want to do blood work at that time because you can get a false negative when it's too early in the OB due to your body not building up the antibodies that it creates to fight off the virus.   
I just recently learned that you can get a culture swab test which at the General Practitioner which is kinda making me annoyed because she never once suggested it. Almost at the point of finding a new doctor because all she pretty much told me was to use a condom and to not worry because so many people have it. But I do go in for blood work sometime the first week of april to get my actual test, but being told by both doctors that it definitely looked like herpes. Not sure about the person I gave it to though, since she 'needs her space' and doesn't want to talk to me right now so I don't know what tests she's had yet.   
Assuming it's HSV1 since the sores were very small and subtle. So basically I just get to live and stew in the constant fear of not fully knowing what this REALLY is until I guess I get the results back.. which i've also seen are not extremely accurate.",2022-03-13 23:59:30,1
tdikac,"Because she had all the first OB flu-like symptoms and I didn’t when I had my OB. So I’m just assuming it was me and I must have had an OB at some point in my life and just shrugged it off as a cold or the flu. I’ve read that people have had a first OB and it was only 1 lesion or sore and it showed up on their inner thigh/butt cheek/ect and assumed it was a pimple or in-grown hair. Which maybe I’m wrong, maybe you can get the virus and never have those symptoms for the first time because everyone is different or have the virus for a long time and then get your first OB and then have the symptoms. She said she was tested for everything 5-6 months ago after her last relationship and all came back negative. And as most of us have done research those tests definitely can come back false negative.

My little sister's friend has had HSV1 since middle school (15+ years) and has a completely normal sex life with her boyfriend of 3-4 years. He gets tested once maybe twice a year and is still negative for herpes. They have unprotected sex all the time, she takes her daily viral suppressant medication and if she starts to ever feel any tingles she tells him immediately just so he knows and is aware. She told her that she doesn't even think about having herpes anymore and in fact hasn't had a full blown OB in over 6 years. She takes the daily suppressant, L-Lysine and Zinc to help with her immune system daily, eats somewhat healthier and works out 2-3 times a week. So many people live their daily lives with this virus.

And I know you don’t get tested normally for HSV on most STD panels unless you ask so she definitely could have had it prior as well especially if she didn’t ask.

tdkl4k,"Hey I understand the depression I was depressed for years until I finally decided enough was enough. I have been diagnosed for 10 years and have had  20+ partners since diagnosis. None of them to their knowledge have genital herpes some had cold sores. I am currently with a guy who is completely HSV negative he works at a blood lab and took a test just for shits and giggles.  He knows about my herpes I disclosed and he is completely fine with it and accepts the risks. There are plenty of people like this who do not care. Sitting around and waiting for a cure it’s silly you’re rejecting yourself before anyone even has a chance to think about it or reject you or accept you. You are putting limits on yourself before giving anyone else the opportunity to consider anything. People get rejected every day for a plethora of different reasons Sure there are people who ghosted me especially on tinder but as I talked to my friends I realized they got ghosted too and it wasn’t because of herpes it was because dating apps are cesspools in general. Dating nowadays sucks for so many reasons if you want to pin it on herpes go for it but that’s not the only reason. I was diagnosed with ghsv-1 at 19 and I thought my life was over I didn’t tell a soul cut off friends and everything because I felt so disgusting and gross. But eventually I put myself out there and had a few positive disclosure s and i began to realize that I was the one creating the stigma for myself.. The more people I told the less it weighted me down. Think of it logically friends should care because it doesn’t effect them. The only people your herpes effects are the people you are sleeping With. Friends are supposed to be your support system and if you tell them your story they should not judge you And they will learn from you And your experience. Hell you May even help a fellow herpes person out becuase if someone discloses to your friend after you teach them about herpes they will be more understanding and knowledgeable about it. But that’s up to you. I’ll attach some links that have seemed to help people and if you need anything please dm me.I’ve had it for almost a decade at this point and have a pretty good handle on it.

This first link is info about a support group I’m in. All herpes people from all over the world we all share are experiences, vent , swap info and remedies, and just talk about life it’s an awesome place to be for sure.

This is a list of social Medias about herpes. Sometimes it does people good to see people being public about it and the amount of support they receive from strangers. The accounts are funny and informative and all herpes positive. There is everything on there from podcasts, YouTube, TikToks, blogs, Facebook support groups, Instagram pages, dating pages, subreddits, and websites.

But you matter and your life matters. If you’re feeling this way and it’s mostly just in response to having HSV, I think that’s somewhat out of proportion—please reach out for help. 

A doctor can put you on suppressive medication so that you have fewer outbreaks and there’s a reduced risk of transmission. 

If you’re struggling with thoughts of suicide, there is care you can get for that too. 

If having HSV is affecting your mood a lot, it might also be time for some care around mental well-being, either medication or counselling. 

This is a very minor condition, as chronic viral conditions go, and it certainly is not worth taking your life.

tddq0c,"You're assuming first, that he had virus on his hand. If he didn't have an outbreak where he touched, you'd have to assume he was shedding. 

  
Shedding rates vary a lot, depending on the type they have - you can have genital herpes type 1 or type 2, as the number indicates the strain, not the location, how long they've had it, if they are taking daily antiviral medication to reduce shedding, etc. 

  
No one sheds 24/7 - not even close. The most shedding occurs in genital herpes in a brand new infection, within the first year, and that's 33% of days a year. So chances are still really good that he wasn't shedding. When shedding happens, it's not usually over an entire 24 hr period. 

  
So that said, would there be enough virus to even transmit on a finger? Not likely.   
If there was virus on his finger, it would start degrading/dying as soon as it touched the air, making it incapable of infecting you. 

Herpes - and other STDs - are not transmitted this way.",2022-03-16 04:23:53,1
tdi8bd,"The accuracy of IgG blood tests is covered on our wiki page on herpes testing: [LINK](https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/wiki/herpes_testing). 

No one here will be able to tell you how likely your symptoms were to be herpes from your limited description and lack of photos.

If you encounter any such symptoms again I would strongly encourage you to get them swab tested. 

Note that there are two different kinds of swab tests available for herpes: viral culture or PCR. PCR is newer and is much more sensitive than viral culture. Viral culture can be fine for pronounced, blister-type symptoms, and the sort of classic cold-sore-type blisters that herpes is known for -- especially if liquid can be extracted from the blister/lesion. But for less pronounced symptoms, or symptoms that don't have obvious blistering, or especially for symptoms that have partially healed, PCR is strongly preferable.

Note also that PCR swabs are less widely available than viral culture swabs. So if you think you would benefit from a PCR swab then call your doctor/clinic in advance to ask whether they offer PCR swabs for herpes testing before you make an appointment to go in. If they don't offer PCR then ask if they're aware of any local clinics that do, and try calling some other local providers.

You could also consider the Western Blot blood test. But blood tests are not able to specify the location of a herpes infection.",2022-03-13 23:31:30,1

I have already read the wiki page regarding the test (and more). It only confused me more since the IgG test is supposedly rather accurate after the 15-16 weeks timeframe, and I was under the impression that I'm positive (testing was only formality and knowing the type). Don't get me wrong, I'd love to be mistaken and find out I was stressed for nothing...

Worth mentioning that right after the initial blisters I did full STD check, excluding herpes, that was negative to everything. 

Should I ask for a second IgG test in about a month from now or wait for another outbreak to be swabbed? I am really in uncertainty.

The older men you see on PS are older because their normal dating pool is mostly women who have been married for years & haven’t been out there to realize herpes is everywhere. 

I know so many people with it now. We aren’t on PS because we date like everyone else. Regular apps like hinge or bumble don’t exclude people with herpes. My dating pool hasn’t gotten smaller. My gyno says 20% of her patients are diagnosed with herpes & we are just her symptomatic patients because she doesn’t test for it.

tdg4p0,"Have you ever experienced actual symptoms particularly suggestive of herpes? Because an hsv2 index value of 1.3, while technically positive, is actually considerably more likely to be a false positive than a true positive. This is discussed on our wiki page on herpes testing ([LINK](https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/wiki/herpes_testing)). 

>Im not really having any blisters. The skin under my foreskin is where it's effected and sometimes get reddish in colour.

Have you *ever* had blisters? Because lots of different things might cause reddish inflammation on the genital skin, specially under the foreskin and that alone is not very suggestive of herpes. It doesn't rule it out, but doesn't particularly suggest it either.

Herpes expert Terri Warren says that, statistically, an hsv2 index value of 1.3 has an 85% chance of being a false positive. Eg here's a post on her online forum where a client asked:

>I have had cold sores so the NP I see for my annuals tested only for HSV2 the igg level was 1.3. She called me and said that I had genital herpes. I have never had any symptoms or outbreaks. Is there a chance this is a false positive?

And Terri replied: 

>There is definitely an excellent chance that this is a false positive, there is an 85% chance this is a false positive in fact.

([Source](https://www.westoverheights.com/forum/question/confusing-results-help/))

So, based on what you've said so far, there is a considerable possibility that you don't actually have hsv2. 

In regard to your question regarding semen, as other users have already pointed out, semen does not pose a practical risk of herpes transmission. Direct skin-to-skin contact with the infected region is generally required.",2022-03-14 00:49:47,2

There’s usually always skin to skin contact during sex, even with condoms involved.

You shed cells regardless of whether you have an active outbreak.

Condoms reduce the rate of HSV transmission, especially if you tend to be asymptomatic. 

But they don’t prevent it—largely due to the fact that people who are HSV+ shed cells from the entire genital area including the perineal and perianal area too.

Further—if you’re certain you’re positive and certain that you’re symptomatic, you’re shedding more cells between outbreaks now than you will in future years.",2022-03-14 12:01:32,1

You're very welcome.

> So i guess i should reach to a conclusion only after seeing that result too.

Sorry, I'm not sure what you mean by this. If you were to test again and score another 1.3, that would *not* clarify things. If you were to test considerably higher, especially above 3.5, then that *would* clarify things and make it much more likely that you genuinely do have a herpes infection. This is explained on our wiki page on herpes testing: [LINK](https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/wiki/herpes_testing).

But remember that a blood test cannot specify the location of a herpes infection. That is problematic when (1) your genital symptoms are very ambiguous and not particularly suggestive of herpes and (2) you were given a non-type-specific test, so it could be detecting hsv1. More than half the population as *oral* hsv1, and a full 70% of people who have it don't even know they have it. If you have oral hsv1 then you could test positive on a non-type-specific IgG blood test despite not having a genital herpes infection at all.

Also, if you're concerned that the symptoms on the head of your penis could be herpes then you could have them swab tested for herpes specifically. That is another option here. But as I already explained, I suspect those symptoms are unlikely to be herpes.",2022-03-14 20:56:44,1

tcymjf,"I was one of those people. I was with my hsv2 partner (I'm female, he's male) for years, and it took me 6 years to get it. I was in my 30s. 

He'd had hsv2 for a long time - several years - before he met me, so he was shedding less than someone newly infected, so it probably took us longer than it might others.

I knew from the start that he had it, and took my chances. We didn't use anything for protection once we tested for other STDs. This was way back in the day, and we didn't know about suppression then. (For timing - my appt with my gyno to get diagnosed was the same day they had a luncheon with the GlaxoSmithKline people to learn about the results of the big Valtrex study. I was their first appt after their lunch.) 

It honestly didn't affect the relationship. I had friends who I already knew had herpes, and they had healthy, normal lives, so it just didn't bother me that much. 

If thinking you had herpes led you to ""a level of existential devastation I had not dared to imagine. And amongst the darkness I felt regret."", then I have to question what you think living with herpes is like, and what it represents for you, because it's a virus. No one died, there were no country invasions like Ukraine, or widespread tornadoes or floods wiping out a town. 

I don't mean to sound condescending, but if you're going to be in a relationship with someone with herpes, you need to figure this out.",2022-03-13 06:02:58,9

tcymjf,"Thank you for sharing.

I also worry about death, Ukraine, and climate change. These things are not mutually exclusive. We are here in the herpes subreddit though.

You are of course correct that I need to figure this out. I know that my partner lives a perfectly healthy and happy life with herpes, as so many people do. And then I read about those that suffer from constant debilitating outbreaks. There's no telling which one could be me. And if I wind up in the latter group I fear what it could do to me and to my relationship. It's the worst case scenario, yes, but it seems I need to be able to accept it as a possible outcome. That's a tough pill to swallow.

You definitely struck a chord with ""what it represents"" for me. It is more than just herpes to me. I have been close to my partner for a long time. I am familiar with, and carry a burning hatred deep inside me for the man who gave it to her. (For many more reasons than one.) I want to leave those bad feelings behind and just be happy with her, but the herpes is a physical reminder that literally will never go away. 

It gets more complicated for me… We have a long history of friendship. Our history at once is a great strength and a detriment. We have shared so much, and we know each other so well, but I also harbor a lot of hurt feelings. (I am sensitive not to burden her with these feelings or cast blame.) To be clear, I love her a lot and we’re great together. She’s so goddamn wonderful. I could work through my own issues with therapy, but the permanence of the herpes feels like the straw that breaks the camel’s back. And that is heartbreaking for both of us.

Anyway, I remain grateful for others’ perspectives.",2022-03-13 20:40:13,1

This is very unclear. Are you claiming that you caught hsv2 by performing oral sex on your secondary partner? And why did you keep going to your doctor? Were you experiencing actual visible symptoms? And, if so, *where*? What were your symptoms? Were you ever tested by swab test? 

And in regard to your blood test, was it an IgG blood test or something else? If it was an IgG test what was your hsv2 index value? Did your secondary partner get tested and confirm that he actually has hsv2?

I'm asking all the above questions because, first, it would be very uncommon to catch hsv2 this way. Second, it would mean you have an oral hsv2 infection not a genital one. And third, oral hsv2 is the least active kind of herpes there. It would pose a virtually negligible risk to your husband when no actual outbreak is present.",2022-03-13 22:03:45,3

Your partner seems okay - you say she's happy and healthy. You don't seem nearly as happy or healthy. Maybe you could work on letting that go, not for her, but for yourself.

tcymjf,"I did have a cold sore which lasted 10-14 days. I had thought nothing of it because I had one once about 10 yrs ago. But I kept feeling ill with flu symptoms. Also stomach pain and burning feeling in my back and vag.  I went to urgent care 3 times and the second visit showed the doc the small scab. They ran standard std testing and said I had bv and gave me antibiotics.  The symptoms continued after the antibiotics. Went through that 2 more times. My symptoms continued and I had chills and body aches. My gums felt rough in certain areas. I actually went to the dermatologist and got a PCR test, DNA swab of mouth, which returned negative. However that is used to detect current infections. So I’m guessing it is likely because the cold sore was healed and I wasn’t in a current outbreak. Then I reviewed all the testing on the hospitals app and noticed HSV was not listed in any of the results. And I started to Google if this was done in standard testing?! Learned it was not to my surprise!!! Went to a local pay test lab and asked for an antibody test for HSV. Came back positive for both. HSV1 40.5 and HSV2 4.19. I expected the HSV1 but the HSV2 no. So I had the new guy go get tested. By now we are about 3 months post oral sex. His results came back HSV 1 0.1 (negative) and HSV 2 3.5. (positive).

So he had the HSV2 and I got an oral blister. Prior to this I have never had any blisters vaginally. The misdiagnosing from doctors and having to go find testing myself was nuts. Makes me mad every time I think about it.",2022-03-14 03:45:22,1

tddfki,"Is she a bad person? Hmmm. Well, I’d say that’s down to a lot more than the lack of disclosure—saying “she took care of her body so what does it matter” or whatnot—that is pretty inexcusably selfish. 

And using this as a way to manipulate you into breaking up with her is, without a doubt, cruel and unkind.

RE disclosure—my personal belief is that disclosure is always necessary for informed, enthusiastic consent—and I’m far from the only person who feels this way. 

But I also have genuine compassion for members of this community or anyone with HSV who is afraid to disclose due to the stigma associated with it. Although I think it’s wrong to fail to disclose when one knows one has HSV, I understand where that fear that leads to nondisclosure comes from. 

That said—your partner doesn’t sound afraid of the stigma. She sounds pretty confident and manipulative in her choice of when to disclose and when not to. 

One other thing to note—please get tested again a few months from now—there’s a good chance that you’re not positive for HSV2, but on the off-chance that you’ve only just acquired it, you might not have developed antibodies in time for your most recent test. It’s always good to know your status for sure. 

I’m so sorry your partner handled things the way she did—it’s always quite jarring to meet someone who’s so blatant about their own selfishness and disregard for other people’s sexual wellbeing and right to informed, enthusiastic consent. You deserved better.",2022-03-14 04:04:47,2

“risk of transmission from an infected male to an uninfected female partner is higher than the risk of transmission from an infected female to an uninfected male partner.”

“One study examined rates of genital herpes transmission in heterosexual couples when only one partner was initially infected [1]. Over one year, the virus was transmitted to the other partner in 10 percent of couples. In 70 percent of cases, infection occurred at a time when there were no symptoms.

Use of condoms and suppressive antiviral medication can decrease the risk of spreading the infection to partners who are not infected.”

td4d5m,"Cold sores, and herpes infections in general, generally require direct skin-to-skin contact for there to be any practical risk of transmission. That means a person's mouth or genitals having direct skin-to-skin contact with the infected body part of a person who has it.

Herpes expert Terri Warren, who has a 35+ year career researching and treating herpes specifically, has repeatedly stressed that herpes *cannot* be transmitted via drinking straws, cups, utensils, cigarettes/joints/bongs, shared food items, or inanimate objects in general. Herpes is a very fragile virus that cannot live long outside the body and requires both moisture and warmth to survive. Also, a certain *volume* of virus is required in order to cause an infection. A small trace amount is insufficient. Terri has stated that the only inanimate objects that pose any practical risk of *oral* transmission are lipsticks / chapsticks / lip gloss because the particular properties of these items can sometimes sustain the virus for short periods and they can sometimes be used by another person immediately after someone who might be contagious. Similarly, she has stated that the only inanimate objects that pose any risk for *genital* transmission are shared sex toys that, again, might be used by another person immediately after a person who is infected. She also advises people with genital infections to not share bath towels *when they are having an outbreak*, but expects the risk of transmission in this manner to still be extremely unlikely.

Here is one such quote from Terri on her clinic forum where she addresses the issue and responds to someone asking about potential transmission from sharing a phone:

>the only inanimate objects I am at all concerned about are sex toys and lipsticks. We do advise individuals not to share warm moist towels, but even transmission in this way is extremely unlikely. The phone is not the kind of contact that transmits herpes. There has to be more contact than that. To acquire herpes, there is a certain amount of virus that need to be present and it is not a tiny amount. I guess if a person had a big cold sore and was rubbing their cold sore actively into the phone and then the next person came up immediately afterwards and started putting the phone in their mouth, there might be a 1% chance of transmission. It just doesn’t happen this way.

([Source](https://www.westoverheights.com/forum/question/mouth-outbreaks-and-transmission-through-phone-sharing/))
  
And here's another example where a client wrote:

>Scenario: My friend has large and frequent cold sores. I was visiting her for coffee and when she was making the coffees she licked and sucked the spoon she was using and then used the spoon to scoop the milk froth on top of my coffee (did not stir). She had a healing cold sore (scab had fallen off). I was worried but too polite to say anything, so waited 5 minutes before drinking my coffee trying to avoid the froth.

>The next day I woke up with a sore throat, slight sniffles and light headedness (but I also had a cold/allergies last week). My top lip felt funny but it could have been in my imagination due to being paranoid or just dry. I got Zovirax and put it on just in case.

And Terri replied:

>Someone else on here asked a similar question today but with soup instead of coffee. My answer is the same – a million to one chance that you would contract herpes in this way.

>I don’t know why medical websites say that honestly. There is just no evidence in the scientific literature to say that this is true and I’m totally a science based clinician. Perhaps it is because people go into their providers and say “I ate hot soup that my friend made who gets cold sores and now I have one”. Of course, we can’t extrapolate that because someone who has cold sores did something and now you have one, you got it from them. The only inanimate object that I worry about for transmission of oral herpes is sharing lipsticks. Lipsticks and lip gloss stay moist and if someone with active oral virus uses lipstick immediately before someone else, that is a possibility for transmission. That’s why cosmetic counters no longer allow testing with the actual lipstick and now use surrogates, like q tips.

td1hfi,"I have just recently been visually diagnosed by an ER Dr and my general practitioner who wants to do blood work at the first week of April. I’ve done a pretty extensive amount if research in the sleepless nights that I’ve had since then and Valtrex is definitely a suppressant and should be taken daily. Obviously with any sort of medication it can be a bit harsh on the liver  especially for those that have previous liver issues. 

I have a family friend I was talking to who has had HSV1 since middle school. (15+ years) She takes her valtrex daily along with L-Lysine, Zinc and her daily ‘one a day’ type vitamin supplement when she has breakfast, she eat healthier since there’s quite a bit of food groups out there that have given others OBs, works out 2-3 times a week and drinks a ton of water daily to help the liver filtrate. She hasn’t had an OB in over 6 years and I have read that the longer you have the virus the OBs get milder and milder as time goes on. Your body builds up the proteins, white blood cells and antibodies and definitely does a good job at fighting back against the virus. 

If I get tested positive for HSV in a few weeks I am 100% going to go the Valtrex route and do something similar to what she does. I have some links in this post I shared with someone a few days ago.

I have sex unprotected because I have no symptoms whatsoever and my partner and previous partners have trusted me enough that it didn't matter to them what sort of diagnosis I had. 

So I took an antiviral initially to make my first breakout go away but after that I did not have any breakouts again. I'm not sure how common this is with ghsv1 but my doctor told me that it would probably never come back because it's not the aggressive type of hsv. She also told me that I don't have to disclose to people but I still tell them and if they shame me then I know their not right for me, so it's a bit of a test at this point. Your body aches and pains should go away about a month and a half after you take your first pill, if I remember correctly from my experience.

There’s a good chance it may be due to herpes I had a 2 week long flu the weeks before my outbreak and then the stress of the actual outbreak had me feeling like crap for additional weeks but it was probably psychosomatic.

2. When do you disclose when dating? I have been single for some time and have been dating recently so I feel a big sense of doom when it comes to my future of dating
I have had the most luck disclosing around the 3rd date when perusing a relationship. Gives you time to get out if the person is a tool bag in general. If you are looking for a hook up I would disclose 24 hours before. I have become a hoe after herpes (I’ve disclosed over 25 times with a pretty high success rate.

3. Will I ever be able to have sex unprotected again with someone I've disclosed to? TBH I hate condoms. 
That is completely up to you and your partners comfort level. Condoms are only around 87% effective in protecting against herpes and if you’re on antivirals with no outbreaks tranmission is at like 1% most of the people I’ve been with have not used a condom (I disclose every time) and I have (know on wood) never to my knowledge passed it to anyone.

4. What are the chances of me never having an outbreak again without having to take the antiviral? Does that happen?
So you didn’t mention if you have hsv-1 or 2 but with antivirals over time there is a good chance I’m to have little to no outbreaks going foward. I have ghsv-1 and have gone 5 years with no outbreaks. There are other treatments to help you prevent / shorten your outbreaks

tczkri,Have any numbers I could share with him? I know you can still spread either herpes type to either region though…,2022-03-13 05:15:17,1
tczkri,"Yes, the number is like 0.02% chance. I don't have the link but it's somewhere on this thread. HSV2 doesn't like the oral area.",2022-03-13 05:19:47,1
tczkri,Is there anyway to know the exact type? I never was diagnosed with which type.,2022-03-13 06:35:57,1
tczkri,The type is on your lab work if blood or a culture was taken.,2022-03-13 06:49:59,1
tczkri,You can get a blood test if you've been infected for a while,2022-03-13 06:54:04,1

tcfqxk,I would leave it alone.,2022-03-12 16:22:43,24
tcfqxk,Unless you have only had 1 partner I don't think you can definitively say he is the source. The infection can be dormant for a long time and sexual contact is not the only way it can be transmitted. It also is not your place to ensure how or to whom he chooses to disclose.,2022-03-12 17:24:45,16
tcfqxk,Personally if you know he has it and won’t disclose maybe approach him first. I was given hsv2 by a guy who purposely doesn’t disclose to women. I only found out because his ex messaged me informing me. Although this case is a literal different because he was known around town for doing this since 2017.,2022-03-12 22:23:24,4
tcfqxk,Hell yeah I would tell her! I wish someone told me! My ex went on to give it to 4 other women. I got to a 5th before he could infect her.,2022-03-13 00:55:49,4

My ex didn’t disclose to me either, and it drove me insane. Since we broke up, he’s dated 3-4 girls within a year. All of them are somehow “crazy” or ghosted him. It pains me to think that he did the same shit to all these girls, but I can’t control it. It’s up to the person, and them alone, to disclose. If you start messaging every girl he starts talking to, he can easily twist it and you look like the bad guy. I’d personally just mind your own business, but that’s just me.",2022-03-12 13:15:00,20

It may not be your responsibility, but him knowingly not disclosing is removing them of their agency which is extremely fucked up and I think you’re well within your rights to have that conversation. 

To say it’s not your place to make someone aware of another knowingly trying to rob them of their agency that may result in long term physical and mental harm and disruption to their health and is in many places literally illegal seems like an objectively shit take. It would be different if he agreed to get tested or didn’t act in this current fashion, but it isn’t so I think having a quiet word with her do it doesn’t blow back on you would be the right and kind thing to do.",2022-03-13 07:14:19,3

I got her number and let her know. According him, he had her believing it was really her. Even though she tested negative before him. I tested negative while with him. And he finally confessed to me there was a third woman. So I told and I didn’t care about the fall out because you’re endangering people at this point.",2022-03-13 04:23:44,2

He said she was an alcoholic and was probably checking me out and accidentally hit the request in her stupor. Then she sent me a message apologizing but telling me he wasn’t being honest. So I asked him what she was referring to. He then said he’d actually been married 4 times not twice. He also has had genital herpes for years. He said his sores aren’t always on his penis and so not protected by a condom. That I should feel privileged that he’s telling me because he only tells the women he likes. I ended it not because he has the virus, but because of the lying.",2022-03-13 10:43:20,2

tcfqxk,"So...I can kinda relate. I tried to tell my ex's new girl what kind of person he is, a lying, manipulating, womanizer. It fell on deaf ears. He is the one who gave me herpes. I tried to tell her that too.
I don't regret telling her because I know this, you can't control how someone will take what your saying. I needed to put it out there that this was the kind of person he is. She claims she won a prize. Lmao...I didn't do it out of spite but to warn her with good intentions. 
If it's on your heart to tell her because it's the ""right"" thing to do. Then go with it. After that it's not in your hands.",2022-03-12 19:48:12,2

tcfqxk,"Absolutely not, its none of your business. They’re gonna continue to navigate through their relationship between the two of them on other matters than this, and also you said he won’t disclose, but do you know that for 100% fact? You’re having an anxious response to this and you need to settle your feeling of needing to insert yourself into your exes new relationship",2022-03-13 02:20:52,1
tcfqxk,"Yea you can ask her if they discussed herpes, HIV, gonorrhea etc. and who has what. If she says yea then they covered everything then fall back. Most people who contract it without the person telling them wished an ex told them before they laid with said person. 
I believe that's how most people get it. The other party knows and is willingly not telling the other person. Then they play the ""it was dormant all these years"". Naw miss me with that. You know you have it and ignored it. Same with obesity. Like some people have a glandular problem but most people just can't stop eating.

Except I wasn't living with him 
My Dr said given the timeline of when I had my 1st outbreak it was undeniably him
Also the one where i was confirmed he had been my only lover for 6 months previously so had been exposed regardless.
Also he had chafing on his 🍆 at one point which can be all it shows as in men. He denied it was him. Got angry. Said he was clean (he never had a test for herpes) and was already in a new relationship. He's blocked me on Facebook and got his friend circle to delete or block me too. He's so scared if I find out the identity of his new partner (that he was already having unprotected sex with when I got my diagnosis) that I will tell her.
But u know what.  I know if he ever gets caught He's going to just say he caught it off me or deny knowing  Or blame one of her Xs.. He's absolutely gutless and a liar. And this is how it spreads to poor innocent people.
Makes me so angry....!",2022-03-13 11:16:53,1
tcfqxk,If he doesn’t tell whoever he is sleeping with he is just trash.. BUT it is also not your place to do it.. you should stay out of it and move on with your life..

I get how you can feel morally conflicted, but at the end of the day it’s up to the two people having sex to be safe about it.

tcfqxk,"because for some of us, our brains are wired differently in general. the stigma in itself can be detrimental to people who are already depressed or anxious in general such as myself. an actual outbreak or constant outbreaks can be detrimental to people. i can 100000% tell you my diagnosis just made my mental health even worse. every time i get an outbreak it’s always me in my head. so no, maybe it’s not detrimental to everyone’s mental health, but to a LOT of people it is.

edit:
i’ve gotten help and counseling and such, but some people it takes a while to figure out what they need to do personally. i’ve accepted that i have hsv and it’s not the worst thing that could’ve happened to me, but that doesn’t mean i don’t get sad and get reminded of how i got it, which was a traumatic event, when i have outbreaks. it’s not like that for everyone for sure and it definitely should be destigmatized, but some people aren’t educated on it enough to know that",2022-03-12 23:17:15,6

tcfqxk,I can totally relate to this. I’ve been very careful and cautious about my sexual health I’ve asked for proof and refused to have sex if there was. The day we had sex i asked to see the proof he claims he left it at home but assured me he was all clear.. we did it with a condom on (only last 2 minutes) & the condom had a whole in it somehow. Now I’m pretty sure i have genital herpes.. or some sort of STI. since I’ve gotten tested too soon n have to wait 12 weeks I’ve been begging him to get tested & he literally refuses and acts uneasy. I’ve never seen a man who “knows” they have nothing act like this.. later on he admits to never getting testing but he never had symptoms so he claims it’s not from him. But I’m 100% certain it is since I’ve tested negative before him n haven’t had partners. Now i look at it all his exes are “blocked & crazy” but I’m like hmm are they blocked cuz of the same reason? It’s just sick & I really wish this never happened. 2 minutes changed my whole life,2022-03-12 20:49:11,1

Which is my fault and I feel stupid, but enforces my feeling that knowledge is power.

tcqxog,"Did you actually get swabbed to confirm the ghsv2 diagnosis ?

If your gf has given you ghsv2 and she has had ohsv2 ( which is possible but rare i’ve read ) for several years then it is highly unlikely for you to infect another area if her body. Until your antibody level is well established ie several months it’s possible to auto inoculate but hsv2 generally prefers the genital area. 

And your future shedding or her her future shedding does not impact or bring on an OB in the other person.  But some people do find rough sex or friction may bring on OB. 

The areas that shed are the infected areas. So if you have it genitally you shed from the boxer short area. and same with oral hsv , it lies dormant in the nerves in facial region and will shed from the skin in that nerve area .  

It’s skin to skin transmission , so body fluids may contain some of the virus but viral load in fluids generally not considered the main route of transmission as a sufficient viral load is needed to transmit. And transmission can occur without fluid presence , skin contact is needed. 

There is a herpes handbook by herpes expert terri warren that can answer a lot of questions or I believe you can contact her directly with questions",2022-03-13 11:30:22,1

But one thing you could do in future to cover your bases in situations like this is temporarily go on daily suppressive medication in advance of your scheduled date. That would very substantially lower the chances of you experiencing an outbreak during that period.

Note that daily suppressive medication requires 5 days of continued use to reach maximum effectiveness.

Ideally, you'd probably want to start it say around 10-14 days before your scheduled visit because you wouldn't want to experience an outbreak in the week prior to your date either, in case it might still be present when your date occurs.

Then, you can stop taking the medication afterward if you wish.",2022-03-12 19:38:20,2

tcg1g0,"Not a doctor, but from my understanding of herpes, a culture of an active outbreak is the most reliable.

A blood test coming up negative just means that whatever antibodies you do have were too low for the test to detect them, thus it coming out negative.

It does not mean you were ""cured."" It does not mean you do not have it. It just means the blood test could not detect high enough levels of antibodies.

Even cultures, though far superior to blood tests, can come up with false negatives. My first outbreak, I had two cultures done five days apart. My first was positive. My second was negative.

The risk isn't ""crazy"". There is risk, but it's certainly far from guaranteed. You know that your hsv1 IgG misses 30% of infections, right? In theory, you could have it and not know it.

After that relationship ended, for reasons that had nothing to do with herpes, I've only been turned down once, and he had a serious, serious germ-phobia. He had a hard time sitting in the restaurant where other people had used the forks, even though they were clean. I felt bad for him - his life was obviously harder than mine. 

I've had at least 4, maybe 5 others tell me they had it, too. (I'm older, maybe, than you are - I got it in my 30s.) I've tried to use it to sort of repel guys in bars that wouldn't leave me alone, like ""omg, you don't want me, I have herpes"", and they say, ""omg so do I!"" and then they drunkenly think we're some kind of herpes soulmates and cling harder. 🙄

You are 24. Why would you be telling your parents you got herpes, and why would they be shaming you? You're a fully grown man.

And omg, take a breath. 90% of people who have oral hsv1 never even get symptoms. Ghsv1 outbreaks average 1 a year, and many only get one initial outbreak and never get another. 

And going blind? What? Yes, herpes can cause infections in your eye, and yes, it's super serious when it happens, but we can cure that now, long before you go blind. It's also rare to get ocular herpes. If you did, you wouldn't miss it. It's not like you'd wake up one morning unable to see. You'd have symptoms that would take you to the eye doctor much sooner.

tc008z,"You won't spread it to your family. 

Oral herpes is spread by kissing on the mouth. Just kiss them on the cheek. 

You can also transmit oral herpes type 1 to the genitals with oral sex. 

Genital herpes is rarely transmitted outside of having an outbreak, and that is only transmitted by unclothed, genital to genital contact, like penis in vagina sex, or penis in anus sex. It can also spread with heavy, unclothed genital to genital or genital to anal grinding or rubbing. You don't do that with your family. 

Herpes is not spread through objects or sharing a household. A lot of people think you can spread it by sharing drinks, utensils, etc., but it's not an efficient way to do so. It's the age of covid, flus, and all kinds of things, though, that you can transmit that way, so you shouldn't share your stuff. 

If you don't know what she has, ask her. You have a right to know that info. Gently ask her for clarification. 

So many things are linked to dementia. Right now, there is a correlation with hsv1 and dementia, not a causation. It's hard to know for sure without more research because so many people have hsv1, and so many have dementia. Is it a coincidence or a cause? We don't know yet.

You could have gotten it from a relative kissing you as a kid 🤷🏻‍♀️ it’s very common to be passed in that manner. It could have been dormant until this point. It can be passed without an outbreak through viral shedding. I’d advise you to do your research about it and transmission. The more educated you are on the topic, the less scared you are.

tciwff,">Can anyone offer some advice? Or tell me what helped them cope with h2. My doctor looked at blisters and instantly told me what it was. I knew it myself I had all the symptoms. Now im waiting on blood work to come back.

Were you not also swab tested?

If visible symptoms are present then the priority should always be swab testing over blood testing. This is *especially* true if there's any possibility the symptoms could be hsv1. Blood testing can be done as *well*, but the priority should be swabbing. This is for several reasons:

1. A blood test cannot detect a brand new herpes infection. Blood tests work by detecting herpes antibodies, which the body starts creating after becoming infected. But it can take anywhere from several weeks to several months before a person will have generated a sufficient volume of antibodies to be detectable on a blood test. This is discussed on our wiki page on herpes testing: [LINK](https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/wiki/herpes_testing). Meanwhile, if visible symptoms are present then they can be swab tested immediately -- there is no waiting period.

2. A blood test cannot specify the location of a herpes infection, or confirm that specific symptoms are herpes. This is especially problematic in cases where people experience ambiguous genital symptoms -- because more than half the population has oral hsv1 (and a full 70% of these people don't know they have it) and so these people will test positive for hsv1 even if it has nothing to do with their genital symptoms. These people may mistakenly conclude that their positive blood test results means that their genital symptoms are hsv1 when they aren't, and when they may not have a genital herpes infection at all. Meanwhile, a swab test will test the specific location that was swabbed.

3. Standard IgG blood tests aren't that good at detecting hsv1 in general. Even after the 12 week waiting period they still miss a full 30% of hsv1 infections. Fortunately, they are better at detecting hsv2 and will only miss 8% of hsv2 infections at 12 weeks and beyond.

Note that there are two different kinds of swab tests available for herpes testing: viral culture and PCR. PCR is newer and is *much* more sensitive than viral culture. Viral culture can be fine when symptoms are pronounced, and in blister like form, or the sort of classic cold-sore-type blister that herpes is known for, and especially if liquid can be readily extracted from the blister/lesion/ulcer. But when symptoms are less pronounced, or not in obvious blister form, then PCR is the way to go if at all possible.

Note also that PCR swabs are less widely available than viral culture swabs. So if you want to get a PCR swab done then call your doctor in advance and ask whether they offer them. If they don't then try calling some other local providers. (and if a provider that you call doesn't offer them, ask the provider if they're aware of any other local providers that *do*, etc).

So, if you haven't been swab tested and still have symptoms then I would strongly encourage you to go and get swab tested.

You also didn't say whether you've been taking any herpes medication. If you are, stop taking it immediately until after getting swab tested, and you can resume taking it afterward. Herpes medication can interfere with herpes testing.",2022-03-12 19:55:55,1
tciwff,"Hey I understand the depression I was depressed for years until I finally decided enough was enough. I have been diagnosed for 10 years and have had  20+ partners since diagnosis. None of them to their knowledge have genital herpes some had cold sores. I am currently with a guy who is completely HSV negative he works at a blood lab and took a test just for shits and giggles.  He knows about my herpes I disclosed and he is completely fine with it and accepts the risks. There are plenty of people like this who do not care. Sitting around and waiting for a cure it’s silly you’re rejecting yourself before anyone even has a chance to think about it or reject you or accept you. You are putting limits on yourself before giving anyone else the opportunity to consider anything. People get rejected every day for a plethora of different reasons Sure there are people who ghosted me especially on tinder but as I talked to my friends I realized they got ghosted too and it wasn’t because of herpes it was because dating apps are cesspools in general. Dating nowadays sucks for so many reasons if you want to pin it on herpes go for it but that’s not the only reason. I was diagnosed with ghsv-1 at 19 and I thought my life was over I didn’t tell a soul cut off friends and everything because I felt so disgusting and gross. But eventually I put myself out there and had a few positive disclosure s and i began to realize that I was the one creating the stigma for myself.. The more people I told the less it weighted me down. Think of it logically friends should care because it doesn’t effect them. The only people your herpes effects are the people you are sleeping With. Friends are supposed to be your support system and if you tell them your story they should not judge you And they will learn from you And your experience. Hell you May even help a fellow herpes person out becuase if someone discloses to your friend after you teach them about herpes they will be more understanding and knowledgeable about it. But that’s up to you. I’ll attach some links that have seemed to help people and if you need anything please dm me.I’ve had it for almost a decade at this point and have a pretty good handle on it.

This first link is info about a support group I’m in. All herpes people from all over the world we all share are experiences, vent , swap info and remedies, and just talk about life it’s an awesome place to be for sure.

It REALLY REALLY annoys me when people play the comparison game, like one type is better than the other. It's fucking herpes regardless of where it is.

Even chickenpox and shingles have ""herpes simplex"" in their names. While I know those are of a different breed, it's still technically the same in  a way; sores, contagious, symptoms include fever and body aches, etc.

I also strongly dislike the remarks that some viruses are better or worse than another. I have seen people state they'd rather have HIV so they can die. It's absolutely so disrespectful to those who have HIV, like they have less value. HIV is no longer a death sentence, it doesn't immediately turn into AIDS.

There's even comparison to genital warts, like herpes is so much worse. They are spread the same, the statistics are almost the same, risks are almost the same, yet herpes is always the absolute worst of them all.

No one makes jokes about genital warts. Herpes is always the one. Herpes provides some of the less overall health risks, so many other STDs cause horrible health problems if left untreated. Herpes doesn't cause infertility or cancer. Herpes doesn't cause liver damage.

No, it not only wouldn't be common, it wouldn't happen. During a first-time outbreak, herpes can sometimes cause symptoms similar to that a of a *flu* (ie headache, fever, body aches, light sensitivity, and swollen lymph nodes near the region of infection). But it would *not* cause symptoms of a *cold*, eg stuffy/runny nose, cough, congestion, sore throat, etc.",2022-03-12 09:52:45,1

tcchwq,I forgot to mention my last exposure with this person was 6 days ago. We had a few pecks on the lips and a few nose kisses. They said they were having no symptoms and haven’t had an outbreak in 4 years. I know shedding can’t occur though without symptoms. Do you know if it’s true that the incubation period may be for some 2-12 days (and up to 30?). My STI nurse said it could happen at anytime. I read the CDC site too. Just trying to learn more. Thanks again for your initial reply. I’ll pay attention to my symptoms in those ways. Any thoughts on when those may show up?,2022-03-12 10:18:42,1
tcchwq,"> I know shedding can’t occur though without symptoms.

Uh, actually shedding certainly *can* occur without symptoms. Especially for oral hsv1 and genital hsv2. (much less common/likely with oral hsv2 or genital hsv1). Shedding in the absence of symptoms is known as *asymptomatic shedding*. 

However, while asymptomatic shedding makes transmission possible, it certainly doesn't guarantee it. The vast majority of exposures to asymptomatic shedding *don't* actually result in transmission. Plus, asymptomatic shedding would require considerably more contact to pose any risk than ""a few pecks on the lips and a few nose kisses."" If a person has oral herpes but no outbreak at the time, then a few pecks on the lips and a few nose kisses would pose zero risk.

Also, you said in your original post that your lips have been really dry. Herpes wouldn't cause that either. Herpes would not cause lip or skin dryness.

Another thing that might be worth mentioning here is that, in regard to flu-like symptoms, herpes would not cause secondary flu-like symptoms unless it were also causing *extensive* primary symptoms as well, ie blisters/lesions. The flu-like symptoms might start a day or so before the blisters/lesions appear, but unless there are a considerable number of obvious blisters/lesions within a day of the flu-like symptoms starting, the flu-like symptoms are not herpes related.",2022-03-12 19:12:41,1

tc4min,">My doc recommended that only take valacyclovir when I have an ob. Saying that long term medication has some adverse side effects. 

Your doctor is incorrect. Only 5% of people experience any side effects from herpes medication at all -- the most common of which are headache and/or nausea, and which usually clear within a few weeks of staying on the medication. More serious side effects are possible but rare, and are not related to long-term use. In the very unlikely event that problematic side-effects occur then the medication can simply be discontinued.

Some people have concerns regarding the safety of herpes medications. They sometimes hear somewhere that they might be bad for the liver, or the kidneys, or just generally bad in some way.

Here are some direct quotes from a highly regarded herpes expert, Terri Warren, who has a 35+ year career researching and treating herpes *specifically*, and who also regularly collaborates with the experts at the University of Washington, who are considered some of the top herpes experts in the *world* (eg Larry Corey, Anna Wald, Christine Johnson, Zane Brown, etc), and with whom her opinions regarding the safety of herpes medications are in agreement with:


A patient asked:

>if I take Valtrex daily to reduce transmission risk, should I get regular bloodwork to ensure my liver is ok?

And Terri replied:

>You do not need any bloodwork done when taking herpes medicines daily, no, it has no impact on the liver.

([Source](https://www.westoverheights.com/forum/question/valtrex-questions/))


>There are no known potential liver problems with these medicines. If you are reading that somewhere, I don’t believe it is reliable information.

([Source](https://www.westoverheights.com/forum/question/why-now-follow-up/))


A client asked:

>I’m also really worried about the long-term side effect of taking Valacyclovir daily for myself ... Is this going to affect my kidney or liver or other parts of my body if I need to take it for the next 10 or 20 years?

And Terri replied:

>It is safe to continue taking the medicine indefinitely, with the data we have currently. We see no side effects that are concerning and in fact, no blood work is suggested for people on long term treatment.

([Source](https://westoverheights.com/forum/question/long-term-effect-on-valacyclovir/))


A client asked:

>How long can you take valtrex supressive therapy for? or will it destroy your kidney if taken for so long? or cause other issues? 

And Terri replied:

>We’ve had patients on suppressive therapy for 30 years and we have good data that long term therapy is safe and effective.

A client asked: 

>should I have kidney/liver function tests each year? I do not have any health issues at the moment.

And Terri replied: 

>The only people who need to worry about this are people who for some other reason, have reduced kidney function but there is no indication that people on suppression should have any routine blood work done.

([Source](https://westoverheights.com/forum/question/please-help-unsure-if-hsv1/))


A client asked:

>I have read that Valtrex is bad for the kidneys. I am in my mid twenties and haven’t had any major health issues aside from HSV2.I am worried that Valtrex might cause serious health issues in the long term. Is this a valid concern or are those false accusations relating to kidney damage?

And Terri replied:

>It is not bad for kidneys in the long term. However, people *who already have kidney function impairment* would need to alter their dose of Valtrex.

([Source](https://westoverheights.com/forum/question/ghsv2-transmission-rate/))


In response to a client reporting that they experienced kidney issues following Valtrex use:

>This is not common but has been documented. Normally, it happens in people *who have some kidney issues to start with* and taking this medicine makes it known.

([Source](https://westoverheights.com/forum/question/reaction-following-valacyclovir/))


>There are no negative consequences for long term use of acyclovir or valacyclovir. This has been studied for long term use. If for any reason in the future you develop kidney issues (not from the medicine), you should tell the prescriber and they may change the dose according to kidney function.

([Source](https://westoverheights.com/forum/question/suppression/))


A patient asked:

>Valtrex – does this reduce the risk of transmission? Is this to be taken daily and indefinitely? What are the side effects of long term use?

And Terri replied:

>It does reduce the risk of transmission by almost half if taken daily. Very few side effects and no impact of long term therapy.

([Source](https://www.westoverheights.com/forum/question/hsv-2-western-blot-to-confirm/))


A patient asked:

>What is your opinion of the safety of a healthy person being on Val 500 2x’s a day for lets say 10 or more years?

And Terri replied:

>Very safe – we just see no danger signals with long term use of this class of medication to treat herpes. I have had patients on this drug for 30 years

([Source](https://www.westoverheights.com/forum/question/suppressive-therapy-3/))


A patient asked:

>Are there any drawbacks to taking a daily dose of Valtrex?

And Terri replied:

> No. I have had patients on acyclovir or valacyclovir for 30 years.

([Source](https://www.westoverheights.com/forum/question/if-you-had-to-bet/))


And some additional quotes:

>Antiviral medicines do not take a toll on your body – they simply reduce viral shedding and transmission.

([Source](https://www.westoverheights.com/forum/question/if-you-had-to-bet/))


>we do not see any long term problems at all with this medicine.

tc4min,"There is no right or wrong answer as to daily suppression. It's a decision that only you can make.

Every medication has side effects, and just like with aspirin or allergy meds or anything, you may experience some or none with antivirals. 

Antivirals can cause kidney damage in people who already have kidney disease, but are generally considered safe long term for those who are otherwise healthy. 

Do your research, read all the possible side effects and make your decision based on that. 

If your doctor won't prescribe it, and you want it, find another doctor or you can get them online. In the US, you can use Wisp, Lemonaid, GoodRx, GetRoman, and several others. 

You can also tell your doctor that you are dating someone who is hsv2 negative, and want to reduce transmission. Only daily suppression does this.",2022-03-12 03:17:41,4
tc4min,"This is a very good question and I am
In the same exact boat as you. I’ve had 2 ob in 4 months currently dealing with my second one as we speak. I don’t believe in taking any medication daily no matter what it is. Unfortunately you just have to wait it out and see the first year how it goes. If you find yourself having frequent ob such as monthly, you can try a 3 month suppressive period of meds. But for now see how your body reacts the first year is my best advice.",2022-03-12 02:41:36,3
tc4min,"Dr is right to a certain extent. I think people worry about taking it for many years probably affects the liver? You could ask about taking it for a year and see where you’re at. Personally I’d only do daily if I had a lot of outbreaks or I was with someone without herpes.

tc2063,"Hi OP, first I want to go ahead and advise you to try not to get caught up with type 1 or type 2 because at the end of the same it’s all herpes and one isn’t better over the other one. 

Moving forward, I remember when I started dating again after my diagnosis. I read a lot about how to handle it and how to disclose it, how long to wait, etc. I was going on dates, but they never went past the first date so I didn’t ever disclose my condition until I got into my first serious relationship a whole year and a half after my diagnosis.

Everything I read said people waited about a month in or at least until they were getting serious to disclose it. I thought my boyfriend and I would causally date for sometime before I would tell him, but we ended up being exclusive really fast. Like after a week. I prepped myself and gave myself another week before I would tell him. I didn’t want to tell him over text or over phone call. It needed to be in person. I already prepared and refreshed myself on HSV facts and  statistics just in case he had any questions for me. Everyone I read said their partners had a lot of follow up questions before ultimately being okay with it. 

 I chose not to say “herpes” right away and call it “a condition” instead because some people hear that word and go into panic mode and not hear anything you have to say after that, so I planned on easing into it in the same sentence towards the end before I would open the floor for questions. But when it came time to sit with him, I blanked out and panicked I just ended my sentence abruptly. The following interaction went like this starting with my disclosure and him blank faced the entire time:

Me: so, because of a previous relationship, I have … this condition that’s with me for life. I take medicine for once it in a while because it only happens sometimes… but this is something I’ve had for over a year now, and before we move forward together I just needed you to know so you can have that choice...

Him: …is it an STD?

Me: …Yeah…

Him: what is it?

Me: herpes 

Him: doesn’t everyone have that?

Me: basically.

Him: okay.

*Moments of silence and just staring at each other.*

Me: …okay?

Him: yeah, okay.

And he just stared at me. I waited and waited for a question. A comment. Nothing. He just stared at me. Then he pulled me in and just hugged me. “Thank you for telling me,” he said without letting me go. “I know that was incredibly difficult for you to do. I don’t think any less of you because of it. I like you, and I accept *all* of you. And if that’s a part of you then I accept that, too.”

I was just sobbing into his neck. I had been so afraid of the outcome and it ended up being the exact opposite of what I was already anticipating. He barely knew me, yet was so accepting of me. 

We’re married now. 

Disclosing is scary. *really* scary. And you might get some rejections before you find the one who won’t mind it. I was really lucky enough that my first one accepted me. I promise you, OP, as long as you’re honest and completely transparent about it, the right woman won’t even care about it. She might even know more about herpes than you think she does and you won’t even have to explain/educate any further. She’s out there. And you might have to kiss some frogs to find her, but she’ll love and accept *all* of you. For *you* 💜",2022-03-11 23:23:03,20
tc2063,"I've disclosed to 3 people since my divorce and diagnosis via blood test. I only slept with one of them but that was my choice. None of them cared. They all thanked me for being honest. One told me my disclosure made him like me even more. 

I found I'm more selective in who I date and choose people that are genuinely kind and accepting. You'll be ok.",2022-03-12 00:51:19,12
tc2063,"Love is out there! Even though I’ve stuck mostly to people in the same boat as me I’ve still had three great relationships since 2017 , just things happened that couldn’t make them long term. I just broke with someone and thinking about trying my luck with muggles but I’m nervous.",2022-03-11 22:59:00,6
tc2063,"Hey mate, you'll be fine! I was nervous about it too after my breakup and deliberately put off dating because I was scared of rejection. Wasted a lot of time and missed out on possibly good things! Eventually I got tired of missing out and came to miss intimacy a lot.

I've disclosed a few times now and never been rejected for it. The main thing is to be direct, honest, confident and calm about it. Keep it brief and dont act like you have the plague; know your worth. Get educated on hsv so you can answer questions confidently. 

Oh, and all this stuff about waiting months - nah - if you find the right girl and you have a good feeling, go with your gut. I do three dates now and then disclose. By that point I've figured out if I like them enough to want a relationship and I've decided whether I think they are kind and non-judgemental and also mature enough to handle disclosure. If I dont feel they are, I don't continue seeing them and dont disclose. I think its important to be realistic - don't just think you can drop disclosure on a girl on your first date, because you will know barely anything about their character at that point and you will have not built a rapport. But don't wait for months to go by; it's just not necessary and ultimately they may reject you anyway. It's about getting a good sense of the person and your connection. 

Disclosing after 3 (good, long) dates has worked great for me and it allows me to get the disclosure over before serious deep feelings have been established, so if I am rejected I'm not going to be cut up about it. As I say though, I've never been rejected. Questions, doubts, worries, mild freakout, sure - that's to be expected from them, but I've always had a positive response after 24 hours, they just need time to process. 

Also, my advice - don't do it in person, every girl I've disclosed to has specifically thanked me for doing it over text since it takes away the pressure from them and doesn't put them on the spot. This is an important point given that you will find most people you disclose to know nothing about hsv except for the dreaded word ""HeRpEs"" and the stigma around it, and they will need time to research/educate themselves about it.",2022-03-12 02:34:58,6
tc2063,"You got this OP.

My boyfriend didn’t care and proceeded to have sex with me the same night. We are going to get engaged this year, been together for two. You would be surprised how not a big deal it is and how little follow up questions he had. I told him he could ask but also do his own research before he makes a decision and he was fine with that!",2022-03-12 04:16:23,4

tc2063,"I’m never sure if I should post this—I think other people have said the most important things, that even though disclosure is often hard and can be really nerve-wracking, it often goes well and there are many, many people who will still want to date you. 

But for people in this group who are terrified that you’ll never date again post-diagnosis—there are dating apps that are just for people who are positive for herpes or other STIs, and you can select to find people who have only the same diagnoses as you. 

Positive Singles is the main one that’s out there and the only one I’ve personally used. 

It’s also a decent place just to meet other people to talk about living with herpes with—they have forums not too different from this subreddit, a blog section where people post about their experiences, and a lot of other resources.

I just never want anyone who’s new to being diagnosed and dating to imagine that Positive Singles or other similar apps are your only options—really, truly you will find great people who are more understanding than you’d ever imagine. They’re out there!",2022-03-12 15:12:50,3
tc2063,"Hey I understand the depression I was depressed for years until I finally decided enough was enough. I have been diagnosed for 10 years and have had  20+ partners since diagnosis. None of them to their knowledge have genital herpes some had cold sores. I am currently with a guy who is completely HSV negative he works at a blood lab and took a test just for shits and giggles.  He knows about my herpes I disclosed and he is completely fine with it and accepts the risks. There are plenty of people like this who do not care. Sitting around and waiting for a cure it’s silly you’re rejecting yourself before anyone even has a chance to think about it or reject you or accept you. You are putting limits on yourself before giving anyone else the opportunity to consider anything. People get rejected every day for a plethora of different reasons Sure there are people who ghosted me especially on tinder but as I talked to my friends I realized they got ghosted too and it wasn’t because of herpes it was because dating apps are cesspools in general. Dating nowadays sucks for so many reasons if you want to pin it on herpes go for it but that’s not the only reason. I was diagnosed with ghsv-1 at 19 and I thought my life was over I didn’t tell a soul cut off friends and everything because I felt so disgusting and gross. But eventually I put myself out there and had a few positive disclosure s and i began to realize that I was the one creating the stigma for myself.. The more people I told the less it weighted me down. Think of it logically friends should care because it doesn’t effect them. The only people your herpes effects are the people you are sleeping With. Friends are supposed to be your support system and if you tell them your story they should not judge you And they will learn from you And your experience. Hell you May even help a fellow herpes person out becuase if someone discloses to your friend after you teach them about herpes they will be more understanding and knowledgeable about it. But that’s up to you. I’ll attach some links that have seemed to help people and if you need anything please dm me.I’ve had it for almost a decade at this point and have a pretty good handle on it.

I was wrong.

For a couple of month I‘ve been with the most wonderful man you could imagine.
Before we became intimate I told him about my diagnosis. After he just looked me dead in the eye and asked „and that‘s the horrible thing u needed to tell me?“
We‘ve been inseparable ever since. 

You are worthy of love, with or without a diagnosis. Fuck the stigma around it. If you‘re person comes along, they won‘t care. They will only care for you. 
Don’t be ashamed and be honest about it - not to everyone, just the ones you choose to become intimate with. Be selective with who you are dating. There is more at stake when dating you and you yourself need to be aware of whom you want to share yourself with.

This is a list of social Medias about herpes. Sometimes it does people good to see people being public about it and the amount of support they receive from strangers. The accounts are funny and informative and all herpes positive. There is everything on there from podcasts, YouTube, TikToks, blogs, Facebook support groups, Instagram pages, dating pages, subreddits, and websites.

tbubo6,"Omg I feel the same!! I want to feel love. I don't want to tell them my secret! Everyone says this isn't a big deal. I've had this for 11 years. I'm still struggling. I'm depressed. Who would want this? The way I feel I wouldn't want to put this on anyone else. I don't want to be a risk. If I ever gave this to anyone and they shut down the way I did, I'd feel horrible. I want a cure",2022-03-12 02:22:59,2
tbubo6,"does that person know that you are protecting them in this way? its a small risk if you take precautions and ultimately its just a skin condition. your partner deserves to make fully informed decisions. if i had the opportunity to be loved, i'd risk a skin condition.",2022-03-11 18:40:38,1

tbubo6,"You have decided this is a mindhurt, and aren't giving him the choice to love you back. 

We talk about disclosure here to give people the right to make informed decisions about their bodies and health, but you aren't giving this person the right to do that. You're making it for him. 

You've posted a lot about how much you're struggling. Are you in therapy? Have you talked to your doctor about depression? I know it's so easy to feel stuck when you're in a depression, but you can feel better. You just have to take the first step.",2022-03-12 05:14:48,1
tbubo6,I reached out to a support organisation and they in part advised me not to disclose. Which didn’t fit and made me feel worse as I wouldn’t lie. I would like to speak to a counsellor specialised in hsv. I feel distraught,2022-03-12 09:27:05,1
tbubo6,"Wow that's horrible. I'm sorry that happened. 

You might not find a counselor that specializes in hsv, but if you found one that specializes in sexuality or sexual health matters, they would probably know about herpes. 

Do a google search for ""counselors your town sexual health"". I just tried that where I live, and got a lot, though I live in a big city, but also had to wade through some that specialize in kink stuff. I tried ""counselors your town sexuality"", and got some, too. I tried STDs instead, and just got a bunch of places to test. 

But really, you're having suicidal thoughts - just get into therapy. Find one that specializes in depression at least - that's most important right now.",2022-03-13 02:36:28,1

tc9mex,"Ok so i have the other herpes and the bumps around the lining of your lip kinda look like what i get sometimes for outbreaks. & the middle of your bottom lip.

Now; there are a series of things that can be having an effect right now such as your medication & the lip filler so the honest advice i can give you is to just go get a STD Screening. Theres too many things going on that could play apart in this, and that will give you a definite answer. Sometimes herpes stays dormat (idk if thats the right word omg lol) and some people don’t even show symptoms and don’t know they have it!!",2022-03-12 06:03:38,1
tc3cdx,"The more people I’ve told, the easier it’s become, because it’s no big deal to most including sexual partners once they learn how HSV works.

By facing my fears and disclosing to protect my partners, I have something to be proud about.",2022-03-11 23:49:59,5
tc3cdx,"You say you wouldn't tell another HSV+ stranger these things. What would you tell your best friend? Sister? Mother? Someone you love. 

If they came to you and said they had ghsv1, and they felt all the same things you felt, what would you tell them? Would you look at your best friend and say, ""Omg, how embarrassing. You must be so ashamed. It's so nasty. Like, I get that it's just a skin disease, but you must have super low self-esteem because it's herpes!"" 

I'm guessing not. Start talking to yourself as your own best friend. Imagine what you would say if she was talking to you, with your concerns, and tell yourself that. Imagine saying these things to someone you love, as you should be loving yourself. 

You have a virus that 67% of people under 50 globally - that's 3.7 billion people - have. You can't all be gross and nasty and whatever it is you tell yourself. 

I'm so happy you've started therapy. Have you told your therapist you have ghsv1? Therapy really helps. You're already on the right track. 💖

Don't treat yourself ways that you'd call abusive if anyone else did it.",2022-03-12 05:09:41,3
tc3cdx,"Therapy is wonderful! Don't give up and don't punish yourself for feeling bad! It may just take a long time. I'm sure the shame and pain doesn't come solely from the diagnosis, but can really trigger those ways of thinking. It took me four years, therapy, friends, a relationship, risks, failures, graduation, travel to really even accept myself as someone who is okay being positive. When you feel the good moments ie, feeling cute, feeling excited, joyful, happy, confident (herpes related or not), lean into them and give yourself the chance to celebrate. Those good feelings may be fleeting at first, but flex your muscles in allowing yourself the right to feel good! Pain and suffering will come and go. That is the nature of life! 

Two quotes I love LOVE so much by Bell Hooks that have helped:  


""At times we will all be confronted with suffering, an unexpected illness, a loss. That pain will come whether we choose it or not and not one of us can escape it. The presence of pain in our lives is not an indicator of dysfunction.""

  
""We have to expose the falseness of these beliefs to see and accept the reality that suffering and pain do not end when we begin to love. In some cases when we are making the slow journey back from lovelessness to love, our suffering may become more intense. As the lyrics of old-time spirituals testify, ""Weeping may endure for a night but joy will come in the morning."" Acceptance of pain is part of loving practice. It enables us to distinguish constructive suffering from self-indulgent hurt . When love's promise has never been fulfilled in our lives it is perhaps the most difficult practice of love to trust that the passage through the painful abyss leads to paradise.""",2022-03-12 23:36:57,2
tc3cdx,"I told most my friends and I disclose it to all new potential partners. It’s made it feel incredibly normal. I do tell strangers sometimes too - like I disclosed to a friend when we were hanging out with two of his friends I didn’t really know. You would not believe the number of positive conversations, support, and number of other people who have herpes who will be glad you said something.",2022-03-17 00:35:39,2
tc3cdx,thanks i really appreciate this as disclosing is one of my fears i rlly need to overcome,2022-03-14 22:33:00,2
tc3cdx,thank you this made me feel so much better 💜,2022-03-14 22:33:22,2
tc3cdx,"Also my depression manifests pretty prominently in neglect. When I am depressed or struggling, I neglect to take care of my physical self which has a staggeringly DIRECT impact on my mental self. I don't shower, eat, sleep, clean, treat my outbreaks (I'm pretty much constantly outbreaking) and I spiral. Those become bad habits learned and good habits neglected. 

The best thing would be to work on your body as soon as you can. Don't pressure yourself, but know that once you begin you are closer to being who you want to be/who you know you are/who you can be. Like with all work and discipline it is incredibly difficult to start. Start small. Sleep is BIG for me. Start with one thing, like a proper bed time. Work on that for a few weeks. Be consistent. Hold yourself to your goals. Don't slip. Then start adding in other things. A morning routine. Making it to two meals a day. Taking supplements. Be graceful, accepting, compassionate, and stern with yourself. Be honest. 

Know that it just takes spoonfuls and bowlfuls and heaps and mountains of time, but the best way to spend that time is to work hard against those thought patterns as best you can. I spent a lot of time hating myself and hurling vicious thoughts my way. I spent a lot of time telling myself that I would never be touched or loved again. When my now-ex and I were together I was fraught with fear and self-loathing and disgust and stress because I couldn't even process the fact that he loved me and was willing to spend time with me and touch me. We broke up for a few reasons, but I wished I had told my younger self not to spend as much time actively hating who I was and take a step back. We may not have been together for ever, and we needed to end things because I needed to stand on my own and love who I am, but I lost a lot of really precious moments to self-hate and self-doubt. It was a huge wake-up call. 

I'm not saying this to scare you, fear is always always the wrong way to go, but know that you are good enough for yourself to love. You always have been. I can see in your post that you are waiting, hoping, yearning for self love, and that is a gift you CAN give, well, yourself! And it's something you are more than capable of giving! You have it in you to get better, to let go, to ease out of the tension and pain in your head. Self love is consistency, it is honesty, it is bravery, it is hard. It will come I promise.",2022-03-12 23:56:27,2

tc1n37,"I haven’t announced it to a ton of people but I’m starting to think about it. Who cares if everyone knows we have it? It doesn’t really matter… and we do have it, so we shouldn’t really be scared to let people know we have it. The more people know the more normal it gets",2022-03-12 01:25:27,3
tc1n37,"If it’s someone I want to be with sexually, I talk about “when I got sick” as a means to start the conversation. It is a condition that can be managed. 

I assume you’re also talking about STI with potential partners as well. It should be part of that conversation. 

For people I’ve known for a while, the conversation starts with, “I want to tell you about a change in my STI status”. 

If you’re forward, being responsible and caring about the other person’s health, I’ve found that creates a level of vulnerability which is the beginnings of trust. 

I also ask my partners to get tested. If they have it and are asymptomatic, then we would have “viral compatibility” and it’s a non issue. If they’re negative, then we know to take precautions and get regularly tested. 

There’s no 100% safe sex. If your partners are not willing to acknowledge that through general serious conversation, then I’d probably stay just friends. 

Good luck.",2022-03-13 14:37:49,1

Also stay away from tight fitted clothing like leggings and make sure to wear 100% cotton underwear! Sending love and prayers your way! You will get through this! ❤️❤️❤️",2022-03-11 19:14:00,1
tbkk8v,"I feel your pain. My first OB lasted me over 4 weeks. I was trying to trudge through it but the pain was so bad and I was so depressed and miserable. When I had my first one, meds felt like it maybe helped a little but not a whole lot. It was still pretty bad. But it’s because this the first one. The first one is *always* the worst. I recommend getting a prescription for acyclovir gel or cream since the pain is still so bad. Whenever the meds get like they weren’t doing anything, I put that gel on and it helped TREMENDOUSLY. If anything, I always make sure I keep some of that gel handy in case it ever gets really, really painful because that stuff is a lifesaver. 

The first year after the first OB is HARD but after a year they should subside a tremendous amount. I was having OBs (less frequent) after every period for about a year and a half. And they would last like 2-3 weeks and I always felt like by the time I was getting over that OB, my period was back and I was starting a NEW one. I get like I only maybe had a week pain free at most. They would have been so much better if I was actually taking medication every day or during those times but I wasn’t and that’s why they were bad. But it’s been two years now and they’re less painful and more infrequent. I even forget I have it now.


If it’s ever super painful it’s because I ate foods with high amounts of arginine so I’ve had to kind of somewhat change my diet. Granted, it hasn’t been proven that certain foods actually trigger an outbreak, but personally I’ve noticed triggers when I eat certain things like chocolate, but mostly bacon. I’ve had to cut bacon out of my diet completely because it triggers really bad OBs for me. Doc especially during this time OP, I recommend slightly changing your diet at least until the pain subsides. Probiotics also helped me. 

You got this, OP. The emotional toll that comes with it is absolutely devastating, and I thought I would never be happy again. But over time I found that to be untrue. Right now, focus on remedying the pain. Then take it one day at a time. Your mental health needs it.",2022-03-11 22:15:39,1
tbkk8v,"Not sure if you’re hsv1 or 2. My initial outbreak lasted three weeks from start to finish, and I was suicidal for most of it. Two saturdays ago was my worst. I was all cleared up, physically, but emotionally was just unwell.

tbkk8v,It will mess with your mental health for a bit. Try not to stress too much from it. It will only cause more flare ups to happen.

tbkk8v,"It’s perfectly normal to feel what you’re feeling. I’ve meet a few good people on Positive Singles.  Although it’s a dating app I’ve been able to speak with many people suffering from HSV 1 &2. While not everyone experiences the same things. The one thing they’ve all had in common was that it gets better.  I’ve met a few whom also wanted to take their lives and after many years have regretted the thought.  Be patient.  Try to learn your body. See What triggers the outbreaks. Take supplements Lysine, vitamin B, zinc, and vitamin c. I’m sure there are other supplements you can take.  Avoid chocolate, coffee and try to decrease your sugar intake. Keep the immune system strong and most importantly avoid stress.  Stress is a major contributor to most outbreaks.  I’m the meantime join support groups and understand that some people can be Insensitive so just prepare yourself for that.  I’m new to this virus and I’ve had several outbreaks.  I’m hopeful that after the first 2 years my outbreaks aren’t as frequent. Good luck. Remain hopeful. And God bless.  We have it.

tc4mb4,">Also, my outbreaks are weird. I am fortunate to not experience outbreaks often, but they never fully form? Last outbreak looked more like color discoloration and I’m still unsure if that was an actual outbreak or not? 

I just asked you on your other post whether you've ever actually been testing and know for certain you have herpes because it isn't clear.

In regard to your question about possibly having caught herpes orally via kissing your partner after they've performed oral sex on you: That would be *extremely* unlikely and, generally speaking, only possible at all during the first 4 months of your genital infection. Even during the first 4 months, it would not have been a practical risk unless your partner happened to perform oral sex on you when you had an actual outbreak present.

Once you are infected with a type of herpes in one location, you become largely protected from getting infected with the same type of herpes in another location at a later point in time, whether by spreading an existing infection on yourself, or getting exposed to a partner's infection. This is because after you are infected with herpes, your body creates antibodies to fight the virus. Your body maintains these antibodies in your bloodstream and they protect you from further infection. Different people generate antibodies at different rates, but by about 4 months post-infection the vast majority of people will have enough antibodies to prevent any further infection by the same type. Many people will have sufficient antibodies a lot sooner than that (eg after several weeks).

There are very rare exceptions to the above but that is the general rule.

Furthermore, an established genital hsv2 infection not only protects against any further hsv2 infections but also protects from any later hsv1 infections as well. People who catch hsv2 don't catch hsv1 after. But the opposite isn't true: people with hsv1 can still catch hsv2.",2022-03-12 01:24:53,1

tc4mb4,"Thank you so much for the in depth info! Another idea was that maybe I did infect my partner, but they’re asymptomatic, and got it orally inside my mouth after performing oral sex on them. 

Tbh, I still get so paranoid and sometimes get in my head while sex is happening. I hate how herpes has made sex so less enjoyable because I’m constantly in my head. This is mainly due to not understanding my body and the virus yet. I am SO grateful to have little or no outbreaks, but they are so mild that it doesn’t look like outbreaks because they never develop full term like I see in so many photos.

tc85m5,"If she doesn’t have any active sores there’s a very low chance for her to still spread it. This way of spreading is called viral shedding. I don’t really know %’s because I am still fairly new into my diagnosis but if you haven’t had an outbreak and it’s been 20+ days I would say you’re okay. If you start to feel tingling that’s typically the start of the outbreak and most of the time first outbreaks give the person flu like symptoms such as a fever, sore/achey muscles and the sores typically begin to start right around that time because your body is trying to fight off the virus.

tc06ua,"Hi, welcome to the sub.

>I was just told I have H2 after having a vaginal outbreak. I can't stop crying and I'm waiting for my blood work to come back with other results please help me 

Were you swab tested?

If visible symptoms are present then the priority should always be swab testing over blood testing (unless the symptoms are deemed to be unsuitable for swabbing, eg very minor, mostly healed, etc). This is *especially* true if there's any possibility the symptoms could be hsv1. Blood testing can be done as *well*, but the priority should be swabbing. This is for several reasons:

1. A blood test cannot detect a brand new herpes infection. Blood tests work by detecting herpes antibodies, which the body starts creating after becoming infected. But it can take anywhere from several weeks to several months before a person will have generated a sufficient volume of antibodies to be detectable on a blood test. This is discussed on our wiki page on herpes testing: [LINK](https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/wiki/herpes_testing). Meanwhile, if visible symptoms are present then they can be swab tested immediately -- there is no waiting period.

2. A blood test cannot specify the location of a herpes infection, or confirm that specific symptoms are herpes. This is especially problematic in cases where people experience ambiguous genital symptoms -- because more than half the population has oral hsv1 (and a full 70% of these people don't know they have it) and so these people will test positive for hsv1 even if it has nothing to do with their genital symptoms. These people may mistakenly conclude that their positive blood test results means that their genital symptoms are hsv1 when they aren't, and when they may not have a genital herpes infection at all. Meanwhile, a swab test will test the specific location that was swabbed.

3. Standard IgG blood tests aren't that good at detecting hsv1 in general. Even after the 12 week waiting period they still miss a full 30% of hsv1 infections. Fortunately, they are better at detecting hsv2 and will only miss 8% of hsv2 infections at 12 weeks and beyond.

Note that there are two different kinds of swab tests available for herpes testing: viral culture and PCR. PCR is newer and is *much* more sensitive than viral culture. Viral culture can be fine when symptoms are pronounced, and in blister like form, or the sort of classic cold-sore-type blister that herpes is known for, and especially if liquid can be readily extracted from the blister/lesion/ulcer. But when symptoms are less pronounced, or not in obvious blister form, then PCR is the way to go if at all possible.

Note also that PCR swabs are less widely available than viral culture swabs. So if you want to get a PCR swab done then call your doctor in advance and ask whether they offer them. If they don't then try calling some other local providers. (and if a provider that you call doesn't offer them, ask the provider if they're aware of any other local providers that *do*, etc).",2022-03-11 22:23:53,1

tbzpgv,"You didn't say whether you were talking about hsv1 or hsv2. Those are both *very* low positives. Statistically, they are considerably more likely than not to be false positives -- especially if you're talking about hsv2.

According to herpes expert Terri Warren, an hsv2 index value of 1.3 statistically has about an 85% of being a false positive. Eg here's a post on her clinic forum where a client asked:

>I have had cold sores so the NP I see for my annuals tested only for HSV2 the igg level was 1.3. She called me and said that I had genital herpes. I have never had any symptoms or outbreaks. Is there a chance this is a false positive?

And Terri replied:

>There is definitely an excellent chance that this is a false positive, there is an 85% chance this is a false positive in fact.

([Source](https://www.westoverheights.com/forum/question/confusing-results-help/))

Meanwhile your value of 1.2 has probably closer to a 90% chance of being a false positive.  Here are some quotes from Terri regarding an index value of 1.22:

>Your HSV 2 (index value of 1.22) is technically positive, but there is probably a 90% chance that this is a false positive.

([Source](https://westoverheights.com/forum/question/what-does-this-mean/)

and

>Are you saying that your HSV 2 index value was 1.22? That is an incredibly low positive, just barely over the cutoff ... At 1.22, there is a 90% chance that this is a false positive

([Source](https://westoverheights.com/forum/question/hsv2-14/))

And your value of 1.2 was very slightly lower than that. The lower the value, the greater the likelihood of being a false positive.",2022-03-14 01:37:33,1

tbp2zu,"Both types of genital herpes pose a *very* low risk of genital-to-oral transmission. No matter whether a person has genital hsv1 or genital hsv2, the risk of genital-to-oral transmission is very low so long as no outbreak is present.

Genital hsv1 poses a very low risk of genital-to-oral transmission outside of an active outbreak because genital hsv1 is one of the least active kinds of herpes there is. It very rarely sheds asymptomatically (ie very rarely becomes active on the skin surface without causing actual visible symptoms). Then add to that the fact that the vast majority of exposures to asymptomatic shedding don't result in transmission *anyway*, and you can see the risk is very low. Genital hsv1 poses a very low risk of genital-to-*genital* transmission outside of active outbreaks for the same reason.

Genital hsv2, meanwhile, asymptomatically sheds considerably more frequently than genital hsv1. But hsv2 has a very strong preference for the genital region. Even when it is given the opportunity to infect orally it usually doesn't bother. Oral hsv2 is fairly uncommon.",2022-03-11 19:44:18,3

tbux5e,"I would ask her, but at the end of the day, herpes is herpes. Type 1 or type 2 could both be either on your mouth or genitals.

If she hasn’t had an outbreak for 20 years and is on antiviral medication, she’s probably not shedding very frequently (1-2 days a year).

Also, please keep in mind a few things:

- 49% of people have HSV1, 12% of people have HSV 2. So if you’ve ever been sexually active, odds are you’ve had sexual contact with someone who has HSV.

- 80% of people are asymptomatic. That combined with the fact that herpes isn’t on standard STD panels means that the vast majority of people who have it don’t even know that they have it.

- keeping in mind the previous bullet points, there’s a considerable statistical likelihood that you already have herpes and don’t know it.

But yeah, it shouldn’t hurt to ask her.",2022-03-11 17:41:43,4
tbux5e,Really appreciate the info! Thanks,2022-03-11 19:45:04,3
tbux5e,"Wait, on antiviral medication? Wouldn’t that only be for an outbreak? Or is that a constant maintenance thing?",2022-03-14 02:43:23,1
tbux5e,Of course! Glad to help,2022-03-11 23:13:10,1
tbux5e,"It can be used for both depending on what the person thinks is necessary.

Taking antivirals for maintenance lessens your viral load, meaning that you’ll be shedding less often than without it.",2022-03-14 02:44:53,1
tblj7z,Yes! I do take it and so far no outbreaks,2022-03-11 19:06:07,2
tblj7z,Take red marine algae. 1000 mg a day. A good quality one. Gets rid of symptoms 100 percent. Click on my username,2022-03-11 14:07:26,1
tblj7z,"No.

It's great for the average outbreak here and there. But if you take it constantly then your body will come to rely on it, and if you ever stop taking it you'll have an outbreak.

Lysine is an amino acid, so if you eat more red meat you'll get more of it naturally in your system without needing an L diversion. So I'd recommend taking some for assisting with suppression here and there. Otherwise, more red meat, more milk, and shower/laundry regularly.

If you're having very regular outbreaks consider an anti-viral suppressant.",2022-03-11 16:26:54,1
tblj7z,Yes and zinc !!,2022-03-11 21:43:15,1
tblj7z,"I’ve been taking it for months , as an immune booster ( wasn’t aware that our bodies can get used to it?!) also a once daily maintenance dose of valaclcyclear",2022-03-12 00:53:35,1
tblj7z,Should you take both ? I started the lysine before the red marine algae but I was told if your body gets used to the lysine and you stop it can cause OBS,2022-03-11 14:08:53,1
tbckua,"Leave out any fear. The more confident you are in your stats, understanding of transmission & your value then the better they get it’s just a skin condition",2022-03-11 00:02:16,13
tbckua,Come back and tell us how it goes!! Good luck !,2022-03-11 00:13:21,7
tbckua,Just be confident and tell him how it is. Being honest is more important than anything. I was lied to or they didn’t know. You know and you care. If he doesn’t understand or respect that then gtfo.,2022-03-11 03:19:08,4
tbckua,I think that you’ve been brave to say it via text 😊and if he will keep it for himself then he is a good one,2022-03-11 12:00:57,2
tbckua,How will you disclose to him? And which strain do you have?,2022-03-11 16:13:58,2
tbckua,Good luck !!,2022-03-11 00:02:34,3
tbckua,I sent it. They responded but I’m scared to open. I put my phone on do not disturb bc I’m nervous lmao,2022-03-11 00:35:19,6
tbckua,"Yeah, I had this anxiety too the first time I disclosed. The conclusion I came to is this: if I tell her face-to-face and request that she keep it private and for whatever reason she doesn't respect that, then she is going to go and tell her friends/family/whoever her version of events. If she is emotionally charged/turned off/scared then it's likely she's going to give a narrative of disclosure that doesn't necessarily reflect how the conversation really happened. So those people get a one sided view of me and my diagnosis, probably without any of the info about hsv and its transmission risk. On the other hand, if I send a carefully crafted text that I know has had success in the past, and I know is honest, calm, informative and transparent (and asks her to keep it private), and she shares this text directly with her friends/family... at the very least it educates people about the facts of hsv and my situation. It may even get those people thinking ""why has she broken his trust and sent me this?""; it might show their true colours.

Either way my privacy has been compromised which is crap, but I think the latter is a bit better.",2022-03-11 14:21:18,1
tbckua,check out my comments below :),2022-03-11 16:38:42,1
tbckua,Omg I literally did this last night to a guy . But open it he may have important questions,2022-03-11 00:44:45,5
tbckua,What he say,2022-03-11 00:44:58,3
tbckua,Can I ask how did you word your text? :),2022-03-11 08:06:15,2
tbckua,Lol isn’t it funny how we have such visceral reactions with stuff like this? I disclosed to a guy via text a few months ago and my heart was beating so fast. I looked at my heart rate on the Fitbit app and there was a comically sharp spike during the time I texted and waited for a response.,2022-03-11 15:32:37,2
tbckua,"How did you disclose, like your phrase?",2022-03-11 16:42:02,1
tbckua,omg omg omg he said “I’m cool with it under one condition.” Of course now I’m waiting to see what the condition is 🥴🥴🥴,2022-03-11 00:46:18,11
tbckua,"Imma be upfront with ya real quick bc sexual health is important to meeee. So remember how I told you I was cheated on? The way I found out is because I ended up with HSV2. I got it from my first boyfriend who had cheated on me. I know there is a HUGE stigma around this, so I’m sure you may have questions or be turned off. I just wanted to let you know all the facts up front since I like you and wanted to see if this was a dealbreaker before I go any further. Before you make any assumptions or decisions, just inform yourself on it and go from there. Also, no pressure to respond now so take your time lol

I think of it as a skin condition because that’s simply what it is. It doesn’t affect my life in any way at all and it’s not the end of the world. I honestly forget I have it because it doesn’t affect me. I am absolutely responsible so I always use condoms and I take a daily antiviral that suppresses the HSV and reduces transmission to about 1% per year. So that means if I use condoms and take a suppressive antiviral every single day, there’s about a 1% chance I could give it to someone. I still do alllll things sexually. I’ve only had one outbreak ever and that was when I first found out. Some people only ever have one outbreak and never have them again. That’s been the case for me so far. It’s more common than we think bc it isn’t included on typical sti panels and some people are just asymptomatic. This is a lot of info and I am open to any types of questions, just be respectful. Lmk if you want me to send you some other info about it.",2022-03-11 13:44:01,12
tbckua,Ok what he say now,2022-03-11 01:16:26,6
tbckua,"OP, this is a fantastic example of how to disclose. I send very similar texts when I disclose and have yet to be rejected. Congrats on your positive disclosure (excuse the pun)!",2022-03-11 14:09:11,7
tbckua,He said “I’m cool with it under one condition.” I said “what is it?” and he said “lemme see them tiddies” omg,2022-03-11 01:17:36,38
tbckua,I've had mixed results when I've disclosed but little stories like these always make me feel more positive.  That was the best response to show he understands it shouldn't be a big deal.  He sounds like a keeper!,2022-03-11 04:06:10,12
tbckua,I think this is the best possible outcome!! Yay!!,2022-03-11 02:45:26,5
tbckua,Lolll,2022-03-11 02:17:26,3
tbckua,YESSS QUEEEN,2022-03-11 04:59:32,3

tbckua,Hopefully,2022-03-11 12:00:06,1
tbt33a,">I'm just wanting to know the odds of her getting the virus from that minimal contact.

Zero. That contact was too limited to pose any practical risk for genital herpes transission.

On top of that, you have genital hsv1. Which poses a *very* low, some might say *extremely*, risk of transmission if no outbreak is present, even *without* condoms.",2022-03-11 19:34:10,2
tbrmvj,I seen the same thing I’m on Prozac.. and haven’t had any issues,2022-03-11 19:32:20,1
tbrmvj,I've been on both and no outbreaks.,2022-03-11 22:34:04,1
tbrmvj,"Wait, so you’re saying that you got outbreaks on lexapro?",2022-03-11 19:39:28,1
tbrmvj,That’s good. Maybe mine was caused by something other than the lexapro,2022-03-12 01:15:50,1
tbrmvj,No but I got prescribed lexapro and was too afraid to take it because I seen a lot of post about it causing out breaks.,2022-03-11 19:41:27,1
