60xlxh,Hi there. I'm wondering if we are still allowed to post photos? I don't see this option when trying to create a post. :),2022-03-23 07:02:58,1
60xlxh,[deleted],2017-07-20 16:33:17,1
60xlxh,"To post photos in the sub you need to first upload them to an image hosting service such as imgur.com and then include the text links to your photos/album in the body of your post. So you basically need to create a regular post (ie a text post) to do that. 

People sometimes get confused because, when attempting to create a new post in this sub, the option to create an ""Image or video"" post is greyed out and not selectable. That's because an ""Image or video"" post is a particular kind of post that  just includes a post title along with a photo or video and nothing else -- no post body or description of any kind. Those kinds of posts are common in porn-type subs such as r/gonewild, or in photography subs like r/earthporn.  We don't allow those here because, without any accompanying description, they aren't helpful.",2022-03-24 00:01:17,2
60xlxh,Thank you so much,2022-03-26 23:40:04,2
npznfp,Interesting to know the majority has successful disclosures and had sex with non positive partners,2021-06-02 03:16:36,23
npznfp,I loved reading this. Thank you for sharing. I'd love to participate in any future surveys!,2021-06-13 04:17:11,12
npznfp,I wonder if anyone who found they have herpes via blood work and got tested again via blood and came back negative. I been reading online that the blood test for HSV can come back with a false positive or even not properly diagnose someone who has it and it’s experiencing symptom,2021-07-16 21:32:04,9
npznfp,"Good survey, hopefully it'll alleviate alot of the anxiety people have. People tend to go on and lead pretty normal lives",2021-06-19 21:01:22,7
npznfp,As someone who was diagnosed days ago this was interesting to read thank you,2021-10-17 18:36:31,8
npznfp,"What a powerful survey, and the comments at the end are profound. Proud fothe people in this group. I hope this gets shared with the medical community. We talk often of how to ""get word out"" - having worked in two professions who's sole purpose was communication and education, I'd target the medical community directly first and big name folks secondly because the medical profession will eventually hear this and put pressure on the big name folks to broadcast it (even better if we get both to help at same time) - it'll take time and persistence - it's both education and marketing; we educate and market to medical pros. My thoughts this morning.",2021-06-24 13:43:40,6
npznfp,"This is fantastic. Thank you SO much for taking the time, making the effort and sharing the results. Wow. Not sure if you've done this before as I am new to this forum and haven't had time to explore your website yet, but it's a great start and assessment overall with many good suggestions at the end in the comments section. As a scientist, please LMK if you want/need any help with handling/calculating the data in the future. Although the pie charts seem relatively straightforward and accurate, the bar-charts do not. They are confusing, both in terms of the axis labels related to each bar, missing information/descriptions and the percentages appear to be way off which doesn't make sense. Not sure what happened there but everything should always add up to 100% total. Regardless, this and you are awesome. Thanks again!!!",2021-07-13 16:24:15,3
npznfp,this is exciting,2021-06-02 19:16:42,3
npznfp,I feel like the answers on here are less accurate especially with the depression and suicide I see people on reddit being so depressed over this also I had a suicide attempt over herpes was in hospital,2021-09-08 09:49:37,3

npznfp,Hi! I am wondering if anyone takes ongoing medications (antivirals or other) to lower transmission and prevent future outbreaks.,2021-09-01 15:48:32,1
npznfp,"Is herpes that much more common in women? 

Sorry if that’s a dumb question - I’m new",2021-09-23 22:01:05,1
npznfp,"Really good work. 
I’m very curious about the differences by gender  though. The majority of respondents are female. 

In my mind I imagine men would respond more favorably to discolosure than females, but this may be complete bias on my part.

Would it be possible to see how the different genders fared in having relationships after diagnosis?",2021-09-29 16:38:43,1
npznfp,It's crazy that there is people who tested positive with blood test and just let that be it. When it could be possible that they don't have it at all,2021-10-14 11:44:53,1
npznfp,"This was really helpful but I would have also liked to see the breakdown between the experiences of a Man interested in women, a Women interested in Men, Men interested in Men, Women interested in Women, Etc etc in regards to how the others responded to their diagnosis when told, how dating has been, have they been able to date regular people, how many of the non hsv people accepted them and moved forward with sex, dating, relationship, etc etc, has any of them performed oral on you or have you to them, did either catch anything, where their mind is in regards to their diagnosis, did it change the way they see life, did it bring any positive aspects into their life (Example: Maturity), to them how do they view HSV in relation to how the world functions, have they come to terms with it, do they now understand why people before them or the person that gave it to them didn’t tell them, did their Highschool teach STD’s the right way, by giving them the actual statistics and clear descriptive details of all details pertaining to it, do they feel the medical industry and colleges are teaching it wrong, did anyone’s symptoms get worse after getting the vaccine, did they disclose their diagnosis to anyone and if so who, how many people know, if they kept it private, is it because they are private people, they didn’t want it getting out that they had it, is that also the reason why they may not have disclosed their diagnosis to future partners, are they on a Lysine Diet, if so, what do they eat, have they noticed any increased irritability with the foods they have eatin, have any of them come a crossed foods that they noticed are directly associated with triggering symptoms, if so what foods, 

And have any of them realized that between doctors only allowing a test for it if symptoms are present, 75% of people not showing symptoms, so more than not don’t know they have it, condoms don’t protect you from it and that everyone whether they were taught right about it or not is risking catching HSV

So with all that being said HSV doesn’t put you in a Black or White Situation but that from a Moral Aspect it places you in Limbo


Edit - Has anyone heard of The dating app called positivesingles.com and if so have they joined, (if you don’t want to download the app cause you’re afraid a friend or family member may see it who doesn’t know your diagnosis - You can still use and access the App just by going to the Site instead of downloading the App - which is nice because that’s what I do)",2021-10-16 11:47:22,1

npznfp,"Hi! I’m seeing that people are having trouble accessing the link to the survey. I’ve tried all I know to do in order to fix it and it ONLY works when you click the link, and when it offers you to “reload” you just have to avoid that and click outside that box to show the results from a mobile device. I’m working on the survey for this year and with a survey service that costs money I hope.",2022-03-09 18:27:33,1

npznfp,I know right. We’d never know if people hadn’t felt safe sharing.,2021-06-02 03:17:04,13
npznfp,"Yea but the Breakdown of the Percentages showing whether they were a Male or Female would have helped a ton, as well as if their partner or the person they disclosed it to that accepted it was Male or Female, the numbers of times they disclosed it as well as the number of times that people turned them down because of it would have also been very helpful as well",2021-10-16 11:53:37,6

npznfp,I’m in this boat right now. I’m pretty sure I have it because I had a horrible outbreak but the test was weird and inconclusive. Wasn’t done by my primary care,2021-09-23 07:33:24,2

npznfp,Thank you for that. I’m going to share my template for the email I send to the website spfpp.org for people if they want to harass therapists and clinics as well! Yayuhhh.,2021-06-24 13:55:34,3
npznfp,"Hey there! Thank you!!! The information is lengthy so if you’re at a mobile device you won’t see it fully. Try looking from a desktop. 

I believe the 100% comment is in reference to the check all that apply questions and the “other” responses so those only show what percent of people selected the options, so those won’t add up to 100%.",2021-07-13 16:35:51,1
npznfp,I have you all to thank for supporting this effort.,2021-06-02 19:29:53,2
npznfp,"So take this into consideration…. People who NEED support, seek support, get a little help, get to a little bit better of a place. My podcast audience primarily consisted of those people. I tapped into my networks and asked that people share the survey with people they know, so I THINK that outside that range of people, those who didn’t know about these resources were more likely struggling. I looked at the analytics and not many people from Reddit came to the site to have taken the quiz. Most was from my podcast, insta following and then the ransoms would’ve been from me harassing people to tell their friends. Make sense?

On the site spfpp.org, there is one survey I’ve done that is FAR MORE reflective of what you’re saying. It’s from 2019 though. 98% of people said they were depressed (not diagnosed with depression) 6% attempted suicide and 48% of people had suicide ideation after diagnosis. So you’re right about the difference in data.",2021-09-08 10:00:35,4
npznfp,Yes!!! I hope the admins let me share it here again! We had a great response to it.,2022-03-12 20:21:19,2

npznfp,Hey no dumb question…. Men just didn’t take the survey. My hypothesis is avoidance.,2021-09-23 22:23:16,5
npznfp,"Great question. I think more women are willing to take the survey, be vulnerable and seek support for navigating emotions, whereas men are more closed off emotionally (traditionally I mean). So it isn’t that not many men get herpes, know they have herpes, or don’t listen to this podcast, it’s that they’re uncomfortable with emotions or to them it just genuinely isn’t on their list of priorities to explore in the stigma space.",2021-09-29 16:40:53,5
npznfp,What’s crazy is that there are people who haven’t been tested at all who have it.,2021-10-14 11:45:32,5
npznfp,I appreciate this input. I’m pursuing funding to do more in depth research (pray for me lol) and this is great info to take into my data collection!!! Keep in contact please. I do little data collection on my insta @honmychest like this often.,2021-10-16 11:49:52,1

npznfp,Interesting,2021-07-30 14:17:59,2
npznfp,Wait how often were you getting tested in that period?,2022-01-23 04:13:26,1
npznfp,"Hey man. Ahhh Gotchya. That explains it. In that case you could do it based on the number of items checked instead of number of peeps. Multiple choice does skew it in relation to the latter but now I understand the numbers better. So each number (not percentage) reflects the actual number of times each was selected correct? In which case each one becomes it’s own 100% scale more or less. I see. 

BTW I Couldn’t  see everything even on my desktop (the display of the bar graphs are shifted, cutoff which sometimes happens depending). Thanks again!!",2021-07-13 18:21:24,1

npznfp,Hi I wonder if that is safe? Did the doctor prescribe it? And do you or did you have recurrent OBs?,2022-03-19 00:48:58,1
npznfp,Thanks for your understanding! That makes more sense - I didn’t think the ratio was THAT different,2021-09-23 23:21:34,2
npznfp,"Many don't get tested either.  Using the whole ""I didn't know"" or ""I don't have that"" because they've never been tested or have an actual diagnosis. Avoidance & ignorance. Although I've seen this true for women as well...",2022-01-24 15:35:46,1
npznfp,Agreed. But as a man I’m curious if men get the same majority positive response to disclosing. Most stories we read and hear are from the perspective of women. I imagine partly men are less likely to seek out a diagnosis and be in the position in the first place…,2021-09-29 17:15:15,1

npznfp,"Unfortunately, in hetero relationships, many women have to take the lead AND follow through on not giving up the goods til men test their woods. No test no sex. I hate that this is the only way to get men to go get tested as this is just one more thing that falls onto women’s responsibility, but it’s the only temporary fix I have at the moment based on convos I’ve had about how many men women with herpes disclose to but haven’t been tested recently or at all.",2022-01-24 16:15:33,1
npznfp,"This is only a hypothesis based on the podcast interviews with so many women, but I’m finding that many women diagnosed with herpes in hetero relationships were not disclosed to by their partners.

People with no help from no ministry of health, what about them? So who will help us?",2022-03-19 00:58:03,1
npznfp,Oh nooo sorry that was interpreted. I mean for people to be more informed about just how seemingly inevitable exposure is. For people to become educated and most prepared for being diagnosed or disclosed to. People need options to navigate stigma. More people living with herpes are “okay” than aren’t. So this resource serves AS the thing to help those most struggling with the internalized agony of their diagnosis from an emotional and mental health perspective. There’s work being done by people with more resources than I have access to in order to treat physical symptoms. I do what I can in regards to stigma.

tyek4a,"it's not an attack or a criticism.  Indeed it *could* be worse is true but it's not my message here. Perspective is. On the scale of horrible things to happen, this still ranks low. Not to say it isn't significant, but it isn't something like war, or cancer, or losing an eye.  You asked for advice on what to say, not what to think. This isn't an opinion piece. 

More on perspective: ""this disease"" which will ""be with him ... for life"" and incurable; you're talking about it like it's unique, special, and full of dread. It's a *viral* infection. Crash biology: Any viral infection that *ever* passes through you is either eradicated through cell destruction, or stays with you for life. It's no different here, the difference you perceive is based on the way *you* are looking at it, and most importantly how he is looking at it and at himself. 

We're not comparing it to cancer, we're comparing his internal reaction to this like it was something (more) serious, like cancer. I'm not going to press this further, i think i've explained it enough for you to have something to take away here. 

a different tact: The way he feels about himself right now, and of the two of you as a couple. If the conditions were reversed, you have hsv and were suffering right now from a flare: would he treat you in the same way he is treating himself right now?

It's easy to get caught in the spiral of self loathing. Sometimes fighting back guilt with optimism doesn't work, it doesn't work for me. Sometimes being reminded that this is a big deal, but when placed into perspective of ""big deals"" we suddenly see how far down into the small end of that scale this belongs. That's not downplaying, simply being realistic.  What he is going through right now is probably intense guilt (and you would know better, you're seeing it) but I am trying to tell you that this internal pressure **is out of proportion to what is actually occurring**. The current reaction is for something worse than this. 

------------------------------

As a side note, and on a personal level: I think you are also dealing with something right now but I can't tell what it is. Maybe it's about being angry at the world with how the world makes your man feel. Maybe it's something different. You're allowed to have your own fears and concerns.  You should share them with your boy, you have that in common and he wants to talk to you about it.

The reality is, hsv is not a big deal. The contrary to this comes from individual psychology, peer pressure, social pressure, fear, taboo, ridicule. Those things, although they are real within their own framework, are not symptoms of hsv. They come from people being arseholes about it. Bullying. lack of education and sophistication. an unrealistic puritan perspective of sex. It's connected but it's a separate social/psyc disease which cannot be treated with anti-virals, it needs it's own treatment strategy.",2022-04-08 01:21:46,1

tyg04g,"So as annoying as it is that people vilify herpes, you’re actually part of the majority, 67% of the population has hsv1. 80% have some form of hsv. None of them are “bad”. They’re annoying skin conditions with intermittent flare ups but they don’t cause damage like “curable” STDs. Disclosure can be scary, but people who are worth your time are not going to care. It’s actually great douche repellent. And chances are, the ignorant pricks who are gonna give you a hard time have never been tested and are carriers. 

Honestly, ghsv1 is the only common herpes not known    to transmit asymptomatically so you can feel better knowing that, that chances are you won’t spread it to anyone. But even with ohsv1 and ghsv2 the chances of spreading it (especially if you’re proactively on meds) is so slim.

""Before we do anything I need to tell you I had (keyword is had) a herpes outbreak \_\_\_\_ months ago. It's called HSV2, haven't had any additional symptoms, doesn't affect me in the slightest, but it's like shingles or mono (another key part, comparing other technically lifelong conditions that don't have the stigma herpes does), it stays in your system forever, and while unlikely if you take precautions, can still be passed on to people.""

Won’t lie you will have some downs there will be partners that will not want too, that is their choice. Does not absolutely mean you will be single forever! Lots of people have hsv, and some more educated than others. You will still live a happy fulfilling life, don’t let the stigma take you down. You will be okay and one day you’re going to write how you found someone perfect for u 🙂 in the meanwhile, just focus and take of yourself and well-being that’s #1 right now and then that person will come.

tyg04g,"23M. Had it for almost a year. Thought my (dating) life was over. There’s no escaping that it’s a pain in the ass, but that’s all it is. An annoyance. I recommend changing your expectations about your dating life. Focus on trying to go on first dates and meeting people, not seeing dates as a means to an end (sex). There’s plenty of women out there, who once they go on a date or two with you and see you for who you really are, will really not be taken aback but the disclosure. And let me tell you, when a girl reacts positively to a disclosure, it’s a massive turn on. 

I can’t just tell you to raise your confidence on dating apps, but try to do things that improve the way you view yourself. Go to the gym, go on a run, eat/sleep better and take care of yourself. When you are on the apps, find a girl you like and focus on trying to schedule a first date, and be a little vigilant about who you pick.",2022-04-07 21:13:51,2
tyg04g,"I was diagnosed last month. I'm a 34 yr old woman who started dating a 36 yr old man early February. We'd been sleeping together up until I received that phone call so, I waited until after we had a wonderful dinner date and decided to disclose this diagnosis. 
I was really hoping he didn't punch me in my face and I said that to him 😅
I told him that I have hsv2 and it's basically a skin infection, I've never had an outbreak and I understood if he didn't want to see me anymore. 
He was very sweet and was more so concerned about how it will impact me. 
He was concerned that I had something that would kill me and he even stated, ""as long as I won't die from it, it's ok"". 

I understand your misgivings about disclosing and also, wrapping your head around this new information. 
Honestly, try to get to know a young woman who has those endearing qualities you yourself have. 

After a few dates and once you both decide that you want to go further, bring it up in a casual manner in a non-bedroom/non-sexual location. 

Whenever you disclose, I think it's important to remind people that, there are a tremendous number of people who have this. MOST don't know and the chances of them passing on you and getting with someone who has it and DOESN'T know are very high.",2022-04-07 23:30:03,1

tylomx,Could be that your skin is just really sensitive in the area which is causing you to be prone to cuts. Your other symptoms don’t really point to herpes and with all the negative tests and swabs I think it’s very unlikely to be that.,2022-04-07 20:45:25,2
tylomx,"As others have recommended, maybe get one more swab if you have another ""outbreak"" and make sure it's a PCR.

There are other skin conditions - has your doctor seen you? There's a condition called lichen planus which forms plaques of skin and another called lichen sclerosus which is a thinning of the skin; usually it causes whitening of the skin and can cause fusing, but other symptoms are also tears where the skin has become thinner over time. It's autoimmune and tends to aggravate then settle down, with different triggers for different people. The tingling/itching sensation you mention is also a classic symptom - scratching it doesn't necessarily always help, but gently rubbing the area can sometimes bring relief, which is another tell. I believe LP and LS need a biopsy but a dermatologist should be able to be of more help than an general practitioner and would know what they are looking at.",2022-04-07 22:12:15,2
tylomx,The cuts do have a white line around them. I will ask my OB and derm about this. Scratching doesn’t really make it any better.

So don't accuse. Just tell them that you recently got symptoms, have been to the doctor, and have tested positive for hsv(whichever type). Ask them about their testing history, and let them know that most of the time, STI testing doesn't include herpes testing - it doesn't - but maybe they could check their records to see.

But that's just my preference and he may not care. 

It's totally possible he has been asymptomatic. If he has genital hsv1 then it's quite unusual for it to be passed genitally through sex. Terri Warren an expert in herpes has not seen it happen in 35+ years of her career. What is much more likely is that he has hsv1 orally and performed oral sex on you, which passed it to your genitals. Oral hsv1 is much more contagious. If he does happen to have it genitally, then he likely has little to no symptoms, since hsv1 genitally tends to be more mild after the first outbreak.

It is also possible that you got hsv1 before you met your partner but it's laid dormant until now. You can't be certain when you contracted it unless you have blood tests from the past that were negative. If I was a gambling man, I would say he has oral hsv1 and is not aware what the risks of cold sores are (there are a huge number that don't have a clue its even herpes, let alone that it can transmit to the genitals). If he contracted oral hsv1 as a kid, he may never even remember having symptoms, yet could still be shedding the virus asymptomatically.",2022-04-07 22:22:29,1

Hsv1: I would ask your partner if he/she has a history of cold sores or if they’ve ever been tested for hsv.
Hsv2: ask them if they have ever been diagnosed with hsv2 or if they have ever had an outbreak anywhere to their knowledge.

tydorn,"The index value you provided is a low value as such, it could well be a false positive. 

A swab on the blister rash would have confirmed your diagnosis. 

HSV1 is super common though!",2022-04-07 15:29:01,1
tydorn,"Yes, it’s possible to get a false positive not only because viruses are similar but also just because the false positive rate for the type of IgG test used most commonly is very high. These tests are better at detecting true negativity than true positivity. If you really, really need and/or want to know for sure, you’d either need to be swabbed for a PCR/NAAT test when symptomatic, or you could ask for a western blot antibody test if you continue to be asymptomatic (which is likely to be way more costly given that we have to send these tests off to only one lab in the US that performs them, but it’s more accurate than ELISA/IgG). 

Did you have chickenpox as a child? Are you of an age at which shingles becomes more common? I’m inclined to say that your diagnosis of shingles was accurate. It’s so much more likely to have been herpes zoster given the location and presentation than HSV1. 

That being said, I also think that there’s a good chance that this was not a false positive and that you have HSV1 *and* you had a shingles outbreak. You mentioned the CDC so I’m assuming you’re American.   American adults are more likely to have HSV1 than to not have HSV1. When I worked for a clinic that provided STI testing services we were required to document positivity rates for statistical purposes, and our positivity rate for HSV1 out of all IgG test performed was 71%. 71% of all of the tests we performed screening for HSV1 and HSV2 were positive for HSV1. Of course given the type of clinic this was and given that these tests were generally administered to sexually active adults who often were not in long-term monogamous relationships there are some confounding factors that could cause this rate to be abnormally high. But even in populations with less risk factors the HSV1 rate is super high. 

So long story short, is it possible you got a false positive, especially given that your value of 1.88 barely exceeds the cutoff for positivity? Yes. Absolutely. Can similar viruses cause false positives? Also yes. Is this the most likely scenario here, based on your description of the clinical presentation of your symptoms and the stats about HSV1? No. I think your shingles diagnosis was accurate, and that there’s a bit more than a 50/50 chance your HSV1 results were also accurate. But I’m not a doctor, I was a different type of healthcare worker specializing in a field that often overlaps with STI screening and treatment, and I no longer do this type of work.",2022-04-07 15:56:54,1

tydorn,I got tested for hsv1 last year and was completely negative. This year I had one relationship that ended poorly and then I got in this one. I know I can catch it from anything but I’m thinking what are the chances.,2022-04-07 16:34:41,1
tydorn,"Yeah based on your descriptions here I would say with pretty high confidence that you had shingles. However, I think it’s about 50/50 whether that HSV1 test was a false positive or not. It could also be the last was a false negative. If you really want to know the first thing you should probably do is just repeat the IgG test and see what results you get. If it’s negative, repeat again in 6 months. If it’s positive, conclude that you’re positive or move on to a more reliable testing method.",2022-04-07 18:55:07,1

tyc572,If your negative for hsv2 and positive for hsv1 you may have hsv1 genitally. Next time you get sores on your vagina get a swab within 24-48 hours of their appearance. That will indicate which strain it is!,2022-04-07 13:31:39,1
tyc572,"Well HSV1 is more likely to transfer if it's oral. You're not even sure of the location. 

As long as you're not hooking up when having suspicious things, I think your current disclosure is fine. 

Get tested when/ if you think you have an outbreak.

It’s a vibrating/shaky/dizzy feeling deep inside my skull when I lean forward, or look to the right too fast, etc. 

I even went and got a brain MRI because I thought something was wrong with my brain but everything was normal. 

And I have this sensation of swelling around the outside of my skull sometimes too, which is apparently consistent with mild meningitis. And yes the constant nagging headaches.

I’ve had at least one partner who has OB , it wasn’t passed to me genitally ( as far as. i know ) , but I also found out that I am hsv1+ and given my mom and grandmother both had OB , it stands to reason I was infected as a kid and am asymptomatic so got lucky in as sense regarding being protected from ghsv1

No one with hsv can ever say  with any certainty they have not passed to someone .  With inaccurate tests & asymptomatic people not possible to know. They are just lying  to themselves.",2022-04-07 08:29:15,3
ty6voe,"A cold sore that isn’t present, isn’t a cold sore. Technically.

You’re asking if they can shed the virus without having any visible symptoms. It’s possible, but it’s honestly extremely rare.  And the devil is in the details.  Details like - do they get cold sores at all? Do they get them once a week?

Each person sheds at different frequencies, and intensities. Nobody is exactly the same as anybody else. So there is no single rule for everyone with this virus.  

I’ve had type one oral and genital for 22 years and haven’t given it to anyone in that time. Never been on antivirals. Never really had any cold sores. Sure as hell didn’t walk around treating myself like a diseased leper that can’t touch anyone.

txyo0b," I understand the depression I was depressed for years until I finally decided enough was enough. I have been diagnosed for 10 years and have had  20+ partners since diagnosis. None of them to their knowledge have genital herpes, some had cold sores. I am currently with a guy who is completely HSV negative. He works at a blood lab and took a test just for shits and giggles.  He knows about my herpes I disclosed and he is completely fine with it and accepts the risks. There are plenty of people like this who do not care. Sitting around and waiting for a cure it’s silly you’re rejecting yourself before anyone even has a chance to think about it or reject you or accept you. You are putting limits on yourself before giving anyone else the opportunity to consider anything. People get rejected every day for a plethora of different reasons Sure there are people who ghosted me especially on tinder but as I talked to my friends I realized they got ghosted too and it wasn’t because of herpes it was because dating apps are cesspools in general. Dating nowadays sucks for so many reasons if you want to pin it on herpes go for it but that’s not the only reason. I was diagnosed with ghsv-1 at 19 and I thought my life was over. I didn't tell a soul, cut off friends and everything because I felt so disgusting and gross. But eventually I put myself out there and had a few positive disclosures and I began to realize that I was the one creating the stigma for myself.. The more people I told the less it weighed me down. Think of it logically friends should care because it doesn’t affect them. The only people your herpes affects are the people you are sleeping With. Friends are supposed to be your support system and if you tell them your story they should not judge you And they will learn from you And your experience. Hell you May even help a fellow herpes person out because if someone discloses to your friend after you teach them about herpes they will be more understanding and knowledgeable about it. But that’s up to you. I’ll attach some links that have seemed to help people and if you need anything please dm me.I’ve had it for almost a decade at this point and have a pretty good handle on it.

I take Valtrex, he does not anymore, this has been going on for years, he’s literally never had an outbreak during that time. You’re fine. As long as pain isn’t an issue then go for it. The only thing I will say is that having sex does sometimes aggravate my outbreaks, as in it will be more painful the next day than it would have been otherwise.

txwqup,"I dont know any of the background to this but it sounds to me like she was hurt by being dumped, which for a lot of people throws up deep feelings of insecurity - in short it rocks the ego, which is not a pleasant experience. She probably said these things because she knew it would cut you deep ""you made me feel bad, so I'm going to make you feel bad"". It's also possible that her comment was laced with projection; having been dumped (and the red flags you mentioned in your comment) perhaps it's her that feels like she's not worthy/will be lucky to find someone else.

It sounds like you've handled your diagnosis really well and been so honest with her. You've also been incredibly selfless by saying you are OK with foregoing oral sex in lieu of being able to be 100% safe. That says a lot about you and your character.

You're going to be OK, hsv1 is extremely common, and you will find someone worthy of your time and energy when you're ready. Don't let this knock your confidence. Much of dating is about separating the wheat from the chaff and you should look on this experience as just that. 

Its also important to remember that you are not tainted, you are worthy of love and respect and you shouldn't feel obligated to have to give up certain acts of pleasure to make someone OK with your condition.",2022-04-07 13:57:30,1

we were together for almost a year, fast explanation to our break up would be that to many red flags were raised. 
She said she was fine with using almost no protection but if you have someone who is very worried theres lots of solutions!
Theres dental dams for oral, or you could just buy large condoms and cut them up.  And condoms and lube is not exclusively for the straights! Condoms on everything if you will, goes over a hand easily, etc. 
I know myself so I know dry friction triggers flare ups for me so a sensitive lube is very helpful.

ty5lx8,"Well that’s honestly a huge talking point then during disclosure.   Here’s exactly what you say:   “I was exposed to it from some jerk in the past.  Don’t get any outbreaks and I’m pretty paranoid about it anyway so I avoid any sexual activity just in case sometimes anyways”.

It really softens the blow when you say you were exposed to it but it hasn’t been an issue in your life.   

Once you get past that initial talk you can act strsssed or paranoid about it in little bits and pieces later.   Passing comments.   He’ll likely end up reassuring you.  

There is a huge importance in the nuance of communicating stuff like this.   The delivery.  Do it wrong and you can make it seem a lot scarier than it is.  

With my current GF, I basically said I think I have it because of weird itching.  And that my last encounter the girl told me SHE had tested positive in the past.  

I let that percolate for awhile and dropped it.  Then later …. I said was still paranoid about having it.  

Ultimately I said I’m pretty sure it’s there but I don’t get any skin symptoms.   Now I plainly say I have it and I should become a monk 😆 and live alone forever 😆. She just says let’s be careful.  it’s literally a part of our casual conversation like it’s nothing. 

Never intended to deceive her and always intended to plainly say I have it … before any sex occurred.

ty837q,"Listen you need to chill out! You are one of the safest people out there, you have one of the most benign types of herpes + are taking antivirals like you couldn’t be more safe! Statistically you are also safer than people that don’t know their herpes status too as a lot of people don’t have symptoms so can’t take the precautions. So out of everyone that your partner could’ve had oral sex with you are one of the best medically lol.

I understand you feel guilty but be honest with yourself you’ve made it a bigger deal because you spiralled and being on this forum doesn’t help. I’m going to say something very controversial but in the real world people do NOT disclose HSV1. Doctors have literally told me to not disclose my GHSV1 as everyone has it and you pose such little risk to the small population of people that don’t have it that it’s not worth it. I live in the UK so I do get the stigma is a little different like people couldn’t care less about cold sores and no one discloses them, let alone GHSV1 that poses an even smaller risk of transmission. 

If I were you I’d get off this forum as it made my mental health so baddd when I was first diagnosed as it made it seem worse than it was, if you’re not going to see him again don’t mention it. Not worth it! I’m here if you want to talk about it - absolutely no judgement 🤍 you will be fine please don’t stress yourself out over such a minor thing x",2022-04-07 09:35:37,4
ty837q,"Yes you should have disclosed , mainly for yourself so you wouldn’t be in this mental state .

On the more logical side , you didn’t ask him if he had hsv1 or 2 or was tested did you?  As you have said most people either don’t bother disclosing ohsv1 ( cold sores - which is probably how you got ghsv1 ). They don’t know cold sores are hsv1 , they haven’t been tested ever , they assume they are negative due to never having had an OB. 

As up to 70 % of population is walking around with hsv1 the changes are greater that he already has it .  

If you told him now and he ran off and tested and he has no OB and test was positive then he had it before you as it takes some time for the antibodies to develop in blood. Blood test is for the antibodies not the actual virus it self. 

If he tested neg but continued to test and it finally did after weeks or months turn positive then he would have look back at anyone he has had contact with in the last 3-4 months so 
if he is doing random hook ups , you will not be the only one who could have exposed him to it.  Even people who test negative on the igg potentially have it as the test has a 30% false negative rate. 

The above isn’t to say it’s ok not to have disclosed but to look at the situation realistically.

Edit. To add he would if infected from you her ohsv1.  Ghsv1 supposedly one of the least shedding and if you weren’t having an Ob & taking antivirals then unlikely to have passed it on to him",2022-04-07 08:22:38,1
ty837q,"Dude relax.   You aren’t going to give him, or anyone, Herpes.   Had genital HSV1 for 25 years.  There’s a damn good reason people say it doesn’t reactivate often enough (or at all), or transmit effectively to others.  

You likely do not even need to be on meds.  Ignore the crazies here who obsess on asymptomatic shedding.  This isn’t HSV2.

He will be fine.  And you should save your kidneys and liver from all the unnecessary antivirals.",2022-04-07 09:00:22,1
ty837q,what do you think I should do?? should I disclose to him now?? is it not even worth it if it's so unlikely that I passed it to him? that's what I feel bad about and causing me this guilt.

ty837q,"I can’t answer that question. But seeing how you are thinking I wouldn’t put myself in this position .  Would he be upset yes especially as he did ask , press charges , well he would have to prove it was you and you just saying you have it wouldn’t likely be enough. Besides some high profile people I don’t think hsv has had a successful case .  Maybe ask legal aide for their take on it.",2022-04-07 08:50:07,1

I met a guy on tinder a few months ago and after texting for a bit, I just told him. His response gave me alot of insight.  He thanked me and said that if we ever became intimate, we would need to communicate and take precautions. I told him I was surprised by his response and that I was scared to say anything. He told me to imagine if the roles we're reversed. Would you immediately reject someone for telling you, or would you ask questions and do a little research before making your choice? If someone wouldn't even take that time and minimal effort, do you really want to date that kind of person? 

He also said that I was denying myself the opportunity for sex and dating out of fear of embarrassment and rejection. That hit hard. I knew I didn't want to let fear make decisions for me. 
It gave me some hope and shifted my focus from trying to find a man who will accept me but rather, finding a the type of man I want to invest time in. I've disclosed to two others since then and for me, it felt less scary each time.",2022-04-07 06:55:24,1
txnvg9,Sorry to hear about your dating struggles. I know what you mean. I always find it interesting that ppl have no problem with casual dating where they’ll have no idea about a person’s std status but feel confident using condoms. This includes more serious ones like HIV. But you disclose herpes and it’s a NO. Why? The risk was the same using condoms before disclosure. Only difference is you’ve been made aware of the risk. Sure they have the right to make that decision but that same sentiment discourages disclosure and if they continue to engage in modern dating/hookup culture it’s only a matter of time they’ll be exposed anyway.,2022-04-06 17:40:11,2
txnvg9,"Even though, I myself am not black, i did experience this just differently. It's one of the reasons why I moved out of Utah. When you aren't Mormon or Mormon enough, you do get treated poorly by the community. I know it's not exactly the same thing but there were things I didn't get to have control over and didn't understand why I was being treated so badly.

Now, with having herpes, the anxiety of having to deal with people again that are going to treat me like I am less than human is always constant. I didn't get to have a choice, much like everyone here.",2022-04-06 15:47:31,1
txnvg9,"Very true. Seeing as we’re apart of a society that’s all about free love and gloats about not using protection, you would think people would be more aware of the risks associated with it. Also the amount of people who won’t get tested. It’s all very ridiculous and frustrating. I’m just choosing not to date at this time because it’s all too much.",2022-04-06 15:32:49,4
txnvg9,"Totally agree. This is the most frustrating thing! For example, I have tons of friends who choose not to use condoms with people they don't know, but would also never ""take the risk"" of sleeping with someone who discloses HSV.",2022-04-06 22:21:07,4
txnvg9,"Aye that was a sign. Haha, she disqualified herself. That’s not a bad idea to start a side convo to get a temperature check but I think not people wouldn’t be honest because it would almost be weird to casually say you wouldn’t care if a partner had it.",2022-04-06 21:20:54,2

txnvg9,"I will absolutely never understand the mentality. I've had far more offers for hookups than I have any long term dating. I've been in 3 long term relationships but probably 20 or so hookups and plainly stated that was all they wanted over the last 2 years.

I think the worst thing about that is as much as I love getting some ass as any other person, I really am starting to believe that is all I am good for and really messing with me for dating. I'd absolutely would love to settle down and find my person but meh.",2022-04-06 15:29:13,1

ty4zc0,If she got ghsv it means she has it genitally.... unless you touched her genitals with your mouth I'd say you're definitely okay :/. Although if you are having an oral outbreak you will not be getting it from her sharing drinks even if she has oral hsv (ohsv). 70% of people have oral herpes. Almost all are asymptomatic and not tested for herpes and even if are tested most blood tests don't come back right as that's not a good way to test for it. You can however get it from kissing someone that also has ohsv as it transfers skin to skin and dies on surfaces like cup and utensils. Which as I've said most people have so you're highly likely to have already come in contact with someone that has it.,2022-04-07 10:12:39,1

If you have an active outbreak you can ask for a swab as it is the most accurate way to test but if you're actually having an outbreak then the test will tell you you have herpes unless you're wrong in assuming it is an OB.

With my lifestyle choices, I can't reliably pin point down who the transmission may have come from 3-10 days before. Those lifestyle choices are why I'd presumed I had HSV anyways.    


I guess I was trying to understand if the 3-10 guidance prior to an outbreak was a reliable indicator of new transmission, but as I write this out, I'm admittedly undergoing somewhat of a fool's errand.",2022-04-07 15:23:34,1

ty3mc9,"Its a tough one isn't it? Because we talk a lot about what herpes ""typically"" looks like or how it behaves, when in reality it's so different for everyone. The vast majority of hsv is asymptomatic, so to have symptoms is to technically be in the minority... but it's a pretty big minority. Its just most people don't know they have it. Similarly, people who get their first outbreak probably get them relatively soon after infection, but I don't have the statistics on the people who have their first outbreak months/years after infection. It's a tough one.

I wouldn't worry about it too much if I were you. In your shoes, if it bothered me I'd talk to a doctor, get the cold sore swabbed to identify what strain you have (that may be able to tell you from who you possibly got it from if it is recent, although I don't know whether that's particularly helpful). Knowing the strain will be useful for future partners and risk management. You could also ask your doctor if they feel its worth disclosing to your previous contacts - I suspect they will tell you its so common it's not worth it.",2022-04-07 15:38:58,1
ty3mc9,Did u disclose it?,2022-04-07 19:27:12,1
ty3mc9,"Thanks for taking the time out to reply. I appreciate it a lot  


I've had shingles in the past, so my doctor was great in entertaining my frantic-googling-informed speculation and swabbed the sore. But there's a chance we didnt't get enough fluid or whatever to reliably test, so HSV is the safe conclusion (which my doc reminded me of).  


So yea, I'm trying to not let it worry me. It's been a little bit of a mindfuck and I'm sort of surprised I feel this way as I've always known how prevalent it is.  It's crazy how much we subconsciously learn. I suppose it's fear of the stigma in relationships.

Your score changes nothing and really you shouldn't even be concerned about it, unless it was suspiciously low (less than 3.5) - which may suggest a false positive.

I would not bother with an IgM - they are useless and most places will not use them now. They should never be used for diagnosis.

Your igG is not linked to how infectious you are or anything like that. The fact you are asymptomatic actually means that you are less likely transmit herpes than someone who has symptomatic hsv2, since you will be shedding less often, which is a good thing.",2022-04-07 14:49:56,1

The number of outbreaks you are having, the severity and the frequency would make you absolutely 100% eligible for daily suppressive treatment. I think you need to go to your doctor, explain what's happened and get put on daily valtrex. If that doesn't work, go back and ask for alternative antivirals such as famciclovir. For some people acyclovir and valcyclovir don't work as well as they do for others.

Some people can be on suppressive treatment for a year and then come off the antivirals with success. So there is no need to believe you will be on daily suppressives all your life.

And just to add, if you have genital herpes and are having frequent sex with people, I really think you ought to be on suppressive treatment even if you had zero symptoms. It would be the responsible thing to cut asymptomatic shedding down as much as possible, since you cannot tell when you are shedding and therefore contagious.

Anything is possible here. You may have gotten herpes from the Tinder girl and transferred it. You may have had dormant herpes for a long time and never knew it and transferred it too.

Your girlfriend had an outbreak before you, right? It's also possible that she has herpes and gave it to you.

Anything is possible here. It's tough to tell. But if your Tinder girl had an active outbreak and you slept with her and then slept with your girlfriend and you're both now experiencing symptoms then that is the most likely scenario. But again, no way to be sure.

I wouldn't argue with the doctor. If they're saying that's the most likely scenario then it probably is. But if you weren't having an active outbreak when you had sex with your girlfriend then the odds don't seem that likely.

So you think you got the virus, didn't show symptoms, gave it to your girl, then she showed symptoms, and now you're showing symptoms after her? The fact that her outbreak came before yours is odd. Very possible but unlikely I think.

txzsf1,What about appearance wise? Because honestly im having hopes in a few months the swelling goes down,2022-04-07 02:35:11,1
txzsf1,"I got the virus in July 2021, 1 outbreak. Then I got Covid in December, and I had new OBs every 1-3 days all thru January and February until I tried non-valtrex solutions. It's getting better now - but I'm about to try SADBE because I can't shave anymore without getting crazy red bumps & irritation, and I don't want a bump-ridden mound and thighs for the rest of my natural life.",2022-04-08 00:04:30,1
txz4xo,"Depends. Everyone is different, mine lasted 2-3 days before they turned into an ulcer. Then they took about a week to heal. When I say heal I mean just pink skin remaining.

Now I use valacyclovir after doing the chicken pox method and haven’t had an outbreak so I’m not sure how long they last on anti virals.",2022-04-07 01:02:06,2

txz4xo,"Disclaimer: only 1 study has been done with a test size of 24. All 24 participants had the same result though.

Basically you stop anti-virals for 3 weeks. Get a chicken pox vaccine shot. Wait the 4-8 weeks and get the second dose. Wait 3 weeks again to go back on anti-virals.

I am not a doctor and you should do your own research on this. The chicken pox vaccine is also know as varicella vaccine.",2022-04-07 01:14:29,1

txu04l,"More details—is is type 1 or type 2–and is if oral or genital or both or unknown?

I have G-HSV2 and my partner and I have bare sex. The female to male transmission rate for that assuming sex 2x/week and daily antivirals is 2%/yr. That means it’d take ~35yrs for him to likely catch it assuming you don’t miss pills and are good at noticing outbreaks. My partner accepts the risks. Your partner has to decide what protections are enough for him to feel comfortable.",2022-04-06 20:12:56,4
txu04l,"Please read my post history here. I dated someone with gHSV2 for a year and I am negative. 

I have taken 2 full panel tests now all negative. 

Feel free to ask any questions.

Edit: anyway I think y’all are fine. Unless you have an immunity issue.",2022-04-06 21:55:24,4
txu04l,"I'm sorry this happened. But you can totally go back to your normal sex life! Just take your antivirals (if you want, not everyone opts to take them) and avoid sex during OBs. This can be a bit tricky at first since OBs can, but not always, be frequent when you first get it. 

Also, this comment another person said is so true: *If he was willing to engage in sharing and taking on the risk he'll be just fine having the same risk with his SO.*

I hope he's being wonderful and supportive to you. Anyone who has sex is opening themselves to the risk of getting herpes, and this is especially true for those who take on extra risk by inviting other people in. Not shaming you, my ex and I had MANY threesomes, just stating facts. I hope you feel cared for and not singled out because you got the short end of the stick. Much love!",2022-04-06 20:40:10,2

txu04l,\^ this!,2022-04-06 20:35:23,1
txu04l,"I have type 2 as well. Thanks for providing the chance of him catching it as long as I’m on top of it- that’s very reassuring. I’ll discuss the risks with him and make sure we’re both on the same page. Thanks for sharing your situation, that helps a lot!",2022-04-06 20:33:25,2

txu04l,"First of all, I appreciate your kind words so much!

He is very supportive and isn’t shaming me/blaming me at all! We discussed the risks beforehand and we knew it could happen. I’m just a bit shaken and wondering how it will affect our sex lives moving forward. But from what I’ve heard so far, it’s very manageable and won’t get in our way too much as long as I’m careful. It’s such a relief to hear. Especially from other people’s lived experiences, not just web articles. Thanks again for the advice and kindness! <3",2022-04-06 20:48:05,2
txu04l,"Well the way I see it is. If me and my SO did this, obviously STD would be a conversation prior to engaging and knowing this is a risk. If she got it, I would be like you're not in this alone. I wouldn't feel a tiny bit concerned if my SO gave it to me that way. Ride together, die together",2022-04-06 20:54:07,1
txu04l,It affects the odds and therefore comfort levels. I’d personally risk bare with a spouse taking antivirals regardless of the type/location.,2022-04-07 04:23:28,1
txu04l,"Yay! I'm so relieved to hear he's understanding and supportive. Shouldn't be a problem at all. For reference, my guy and I have unprotected sex about 5x/week for two years and I haven't transmitted. Some (not all) women have similar experiences of having sex for many years without transmission. So, while it's always a possibility, I wouldn't worry about it too much. Life (and good sex!) goes on! :)",2022-04-06 21:53:00,3

txtxyd,Hey I have a question for you. Have you ever done the western blot by any chance? I believe I may have been exposed and my igg tests also keep coming back negative consistently but I wasn’t diagnosed by swab. I know that they say igg actually misses 30% of hsv1 cases so I’m just curious if maybe that’s the case. The reason I ask if you did the WB is because I’m curious if that one turned up positive for you after continuing to be negative on the igg.,2022-04-06 20:24:20,2
txtxyd,Following cause i have the same questions,2022-04-06 20:10:21,1
txtxyd,If there are no antibodies in the body does that mean u no longer carry the virus?,2022-04-06 20:11:59,1
txtxyd,"You aren't losing antibodies.   


The hsv1 IgG misses 30% of infections. It's probably missing yours. If you need confirmation, get the western blot.",2022-04-07 01:16:32,1
txtxyd,"No.  Ive never had a western blot.  I had two swabs when I had my OB (the first just confirmed herpes, the 2nd said it was HSV1).  But I will say that my OB didn’t present in the classical fashion and my doc didn’t think it was herpes when he first saw it so he was a little surprised the swabs came back positive.",2022-04-06 20:36:41,2
txtxyd,"No. I think once you the virus is in, it’s in you.",2022-04-06 20:59:18,1
txtxyd,Could you explain to me then why igg levels go up and down on tests then if you don’t lose antibodies?,2022-04-07 01:23:24,1
txtxyd,Wow that’s interesting! Good to know because I wouldn’t say mine looked typical for hsv either. Yeah I was just curious because I’m about to do the western blot in a few days and I’m nervous to see the outcome because apparently you could test negative on igg but actually end up positive. I don’t know if you’d think of doing the western blot I mean I guess you already know you have it but it would be interesting to see if igg is just missing it for you and that’s why it keeps coming up as negative. Apparently the antibodies are supposed to stay for life but who knows.. I could be wrong lol,2022-04-06 20:39:19,2
txtxyd,But then you should always have antibodies no? I mean I had chickenpox when I was 11 and it still showed up in my blood work. It confuses me lol all of it. Maybe why I’m not a scientist or doctor lol,2022-04-06 21:03:30,2
txtxyd,"I also have a question about this, I think antibodies may go down as the infection goes dormant/controlled
I could be wrong but I’m not sure since there’s so many misconceptions",2022-04-07 04:48:50,1
txtxyd,Ok then would that mean with ppl who have say a 2 then test again and it’s.80. What did the test pick up? It’s picking up some antibodies. I know. Tests aren’t always reliable but that would make me think that the viral load isn’t as strong when the numbers go down but even at more then 0 on an igg test it’s picking up something in your blood that’s herpes I would think. No?,2022-04-07 04:53:53,1
txtxyd,"I guess this is why the tests are often unreliable. Sometimes the antibody count isn’t picked up even though there is an infection lying dormant or asymptomatic that still sheds

But again this is only an assumption
I know something about microbiology and science but I am waiting to speak to a knowledgeable doctor soon because I have many questions",2022-04-07 05:14:03,1
txtxyd,If you get any answers… would you mind coming back and updating me please?,2022-04-07 13:16:58,1
txtxyd,Please post if you get more information from your doctor.  I’d be very interested to hear what they have to say.,2022-04-07 16:28:19,1

txy2b7,You shouldn’t no. HSV2 protects you from HSV1.,2022-04-06 22:30:44,3
txy2b7,If it is in the corner of your lips I'd say read on about cheilitis it is more likely to be on the corners of your lips and a lot of people confuse that with herpes. I did too :).,2022-04-06 23:05:51,2

txxsnh,"Would just call the doc and ask for the type of test and the numbers. Then you can see if you are I a range for likely errors. IF suspicion for accuracy once you have that, another test makes sense. Just because many people have hsv1 does not mean we should foster ignorance. Your question is totally valid, and just take the smack talk you might hear from the peanut gallery and let it roll.

txwqic,Nope dosent work like that but anxiety will cause nerve sensations.  I had the same thing until I calmed down about this and now I'm g2g.,2022-04-07 03:15:55,2
txwqic,HSV doesn’t do that. I second this sounds more like  a mental illness than a physical one.,2022-04-07 07:01:28,1
txwitj,Probably best not to guess. Have the bloodwork so you can have some peace of mind.,2022-04-06 21:29:59,6
txwitj,I only tested because I had one encounter with someone who texted a few days later saying that they'd just had their first outbreak. If I had not been experiencing a very visually typical outbreak at the time I would not have tested for the same reasons that your doctor is implying. It's a shitty club to belong to.,2022-04-06 21:36:26,3

txwitj,"Based on your replies to everyone’s “you should get tested” .. I will suggest don’t get tested. Seems like that’s what you want to be told.

The decision is totally up to you. If you don’t have any symptoms and can eventually get rid of the thought of “should I get tested???” and live life care free… then don’t get tested.",2022-04-06 23:13:52,2

txwitj,"It's not, it's a liability.",2022-04-06 23:32:57,4
txwitj,You're thinking in terms of morals because herpes gets a ton more irrational scrutiny than all of the other immoral shit you do everyday. Take your doctor's advice and buy some carbon offsets.,2022-04-06 23:31:22,0
txwitj,"Yes, but only because I got the ""you might have herpes"" text and immediately had symptoms that looked exactly like google images. My goal in testing was to know what strain I had. I have type 1 which is the strain more likely to occur once and then rarely if ever again, which has been the case with me 8 months in.",2022-04-06 23:27:24,1
txwitj,"The problem is that you can shed asymptomatically and infect others. For years down the road. Even when not having outbreaks.

The whole reason that genital HSV-1 infections are so common now is the lack of adequate testing and people either not knowing they should inform new partners or not caring to inform new partners they have oral herpes before going down on them.

If you read some of the comment threads in subs like r/herpescureresearch, there are people who are really, really depressed because they have these chronic outbreaks that cause them a huge amount of pain and suffering. That's a small percentage of people who carry herpes who deal with really excruciating symptoms. But it's unethical to not inform new sex partners if you do have it, so they can make their own decision about the risk.",2022-04-07 01:54:58,3

1. If you still have symptoms, go tp a doctor and they’ll swab test you to know for sure if those bumps are HSV-2 or something else.

The moment you see past your hsv and you learn to love yourself, someone right will come along that see you for you. Sounds like you enjoy sex as much as he does. But sounds like you want a deeper connection and it's not gonna be with him. He's immature and isn't even flinching when you say other guys want you. He's not the one to commit to you.

First off, I made an account specifically to comment on your post. I know exactly how you feel bc I used to be you. I say this with nothing but love, but homeboy keeps coming back and testing your boundaries bc he knows that he can get away with it. You have to love yourself enough to truly put your foot down, even when he does come crawling back. You are worth more and deserve more than scraps of attention from someone that doesn't value you. He's shown you again and again that he isn't capable of giving you the type of relationship that you are craving, and even keeps coming back even though he knows it ends up hurting you. Disrespectful and selfish.  

He sounds emotionally unavailable af, and it sounds like you could have some type of unhealthy attachment (you should look up Attachment Theory, it's super interesting and actually explains a lot.) I'm here if you need to talk, sending virtual hugs your way!",2022-04-06 21:05:23,3

Not to say he doesn’t make me feel lonely anyway. I don’t see myself going back tho. I feel better than I did earlier. I nodded off and slept terribly and right before work yayy. I feel almost nothing right now that usually comes after the crying. But it feels like there’s a gray cloud hanging over me. I know it takes time to start to truly feel better but I wish I could just skip to the part where I don’t think about him anymore. I wish there was a certainty that he won’t contact me again. Saying no and meaning it is the hardest part. He’ll say something like I know you hate me to get a response and I even tho I know it I respond anyway saying I don’t hate him just the way he treats me. I’m always saying things to convince him I’m not angry or upset with him just done. I think the best thing to do is not respond anymore. Because I always think this time will be different.

Not all solopoly relationships are this selfish though.

He'll eventually stop after you give him some consistent silence. In the mean time, everyone is different but what helped me to build my self love was self help/dating podcasts and books, and journaling.

txqp17,"Howdy partner, I dated a woman with HSV2 (Obvs genital) 

I am fully negative.

You have HSV1 I wouldn’t worry about it. The vast majority of people do not care for HSV1, the vast majority of people have it. 

Also HSV1 is a lot less contagious, and a lot less frequent in OB. 

It depends on the person, my ex girlfriend waited until we had sex to disclose she had HSV2. 

To give an idea I studied biomedical engineering so I am familiar to how herpes works (more than regular people I guess) and when she told me she was on anti virals I said I didnt care. We dated for a year, then broke up, months later I got tested (twice btw) and I am still negative. 

How to disclose?

Just make them and yourself take a full panel test before sex. That’s it. Like I wouldn’t even bother to let them know until after the results. They might have HSV1 (statistically speaking) or HSV2 even. Or HPV. 

That way, you find out if they are negative, and you can easily disclose. 

**This is how it should be anyway, because just because you have HSV1 it doesn’t mean they don’t have HIV, or anything else. It would not only make them feel safer but it would make you look like you take care of yourself.**

So as for you, I wouldn’t explicitly call HSV1 herpes during disclosure because no one does. Call it cold sores (cold sores are herpes anyway), I would also not even disclose where it is **unless asked**. But as always, say it’s HSV1. 

Why? Because unless y’all are never doing oral sex the location of the virus for HSV1 is irrelevant.",2022-04-06 18:18:13,3
txqp17,"you just have to find someone that is well educated about herpes. Or hell maybe even someone that has it themselves. I’m a 17 year old male and when i found out i had hsv1 I immediately told my girlfriend.

txqp17,"Yes, literally. But they can also get genital HSV1 by fucking you. 

So at the end of the day the location is not too relevant. If you were to give them oral and you had oral HSV1 you could also give them genital herpes.

You could have gotten HSV-2; bloodwork WOULD show that so request that blood test at the right time.

Pay attention as to how that article is peer reviewed by an MD as well. 

Accuracy rating is 9/10

> STD tests are among the most urgent positive/negative tests, and for these, LetsGetChecked utilizes NAAT PCR tests and electrochemiluminescence arrays whenever possible. These have a significant degree of accuracy without requiring a high concentration of a given analyte in your sample. That means you’re more likely to get more accurate results than you would from a simple culture.

> LetsGetChecked utilizes labs in the US that are CLIA-certified and CAP-accredited, meaning that they adhere to the same stringent standards as any other major testing facility in the medical industry. The results our testers received went into a fair amount of detail, providing specific level measurements for certain biomarkers where appropriate.

txnuop,"It’s most likely is herpes, because of the blister-like sore. There are two types, HSV1 and HSV2. Either one can infect genitals or mouth. It won’t kill you, but there isn’t a cure. It is a life long viral infection. 

We don’t know for sure though. I advise you to start educating yourself about STIs, either by videos on YouTube or Google. 

Go to a gynecologist ASAP and get a swab test. Also, ask for a FULL PANEL STI test too. Urine, blood, swab, and maybe a Pap smear. You might as well check for other STI’s that you could’ve contracted. 

The doctor will give you more advice on treatment and direction once you get your diagnosis. 

For now, keep your hands away from the area. If you do touch or itch, wash your hands with warm water and soap. HSV can be spread anywhere on the body, not just on the mouth and genitals.

HSV can stay dormant in the body for weeks, months, or years. Men tend to have less severe physical symptoms. So the guy that potentially gave it to you just wasn’t aware, or lied. 
When you get your test results, it’s best to inform him of what happened and to tell him to get checked himself. He shouldn’t be spreading it freely like that, if he does have it. 

HSV is very common, and most people don’t know they have it. About one or two thirds of the human population has a form of HSV. 

Depending on the person, a lot of STIs don’t show symptoms. Unfortunately, people are not educated enough in sexual health, so that’s why people don’t really get regularly tested or think they need to be regularly tested. Good luck",2022-04-06 15:50:34,3

twzui3,"I dont know, folks. My mind is blown that as soon as you contract a lifelong incurable disease, the initial outbreak often being referred to by users on here as, ""the worst pain of my life,"" you start life hacking the best script to get uninfected people to sleep with you and also absolve you of any guilt when they finally catch it. ""They knew the 1 percent risk lol."" You can be damn sure if I ever catch genital herpes that the virus stops with me. The stigma isn't the worst part of herpes. Herpes is the worst part of herpes. Viral fluid filled vesicles that burst and crust over on your privates. I've been coming here to understand why a woman seduced me for a month just to disclose and then throw ""guys don't care"" in my face when I balked. Guys will care when the script is flipped and they're the ones asking to be accepted. Keep celebrating that you convinced someone to put themselves in harm's way.",2022-04-06 02:14:49,-5

So from there I tell him that it is the same virus and that 80 percent of the population carry the virus and that he might already have it, too without knowing. And that in my case I don't get blisters on the lips but in the downstairs department. Then he starts asking about transmission and how it affects sex Iife and I respond.

Historically most cases of genital herpes were caused by HSV-2, but that is starting to shift, at least in America, as fewer people get oral HSV-1 in childhood (which would grants immunity from genital HSV-1 - though not genital HSV-2).",2022-04-06 03:04:16,1

twzui3,"You sound like a total joy kill. People with herpes are still people and are more than deserving of enjoying fulfilling lives and relationships with others. I contracted herpes (unknowingly and unwillingly) and honestly did feel really sad and down about it when I was diagnosed. Did I want it? No. Did my partner disclose? No. Why? He had zero clue that he had it, he’s asymptomatic 99.9% of the time. His situation is the largest percent of the herpes population. Most people don’t know they have it and std tests don’t check for it (because it’s so common). 

Herpes isn’t always pleasant, whereas my bf doesn’t get outbreaks, I’m often stressed and it triggers mine and they do ache/hurt. It won’t ever kill me though. I’m not less of a person because I have herpes. I’m not dirty or gross because I have herpes. I’m just me. I’m a kind, beautiful and intelligent person that’s just as deserving of love and happiness, as any other kind, beautiful and intelligent person. 

We’re not using a script. It isn’t about infected and uninflected people. Get your head out of your ass and stop the stigma! Honestly blessings to you if you ever discover you’ve got herpes lol.",2022-04-06 06:08:50,2

Instead, I instantly felt very sad and genuinely sorry for you.You seem to think locking yourself away if you are ever diagnosed is the ethical thing to do. It is not. The ethical thing to do is give everyone a choice. In your life, I hope you prepare yourself for when you have to deal with any true adversities as life is about adapting. 

Honest people with herpes adapt to a new way of dating and put their partner's health as a priority by disclosing. Look for the good in the situation by recognizing that the woman that 'seduced' you actually cared about your health enough to give you a choice. Future partners may not be so forthright so appreciate her honesty and move on. 

People with herpes are people too with just a few extra bumps now and again.",2022-04-06 10:03:06,1

I think coming on here to find an answer yo why this lady gave you herpes may be the wrong approach. I mean, it is what it is now?

twzui3,But technically they’re right in saying you could get genital herpes from someone who has the ‘cold sore’ virus. And I don’t think people realise that enough. I even see a hierarchy in people with HSV1 thinking they’re ‘cleaner’ than people who’ve contracted HSV2 which is ridiculous.,2022-04-06 06:02:28,3

twzui3,"I feel you girl, because I was the one in his position, My boyfriend, after three dates (while we were on our fourth) disclosed to me that he has ghsv2. He explained that he was on meds and all of that jazz, and discussed with me how we could keep me as safe as possible. I got tested to be sure that I didn't already have it. I didn't (at least not according to an IGG blood test). I knew he was the one, and I decided to take the risk. 6 months in I did unfortunately contract it, and it's been pretty unpleasant. I'm coming off of the worst outbreak of my life right now. I've been squeezing tube after tube of lidocaine into my vag just so that I can have the hope of enough relief to be able to breathe through the pain. 

Would I change anything though? Would I go back and change my mind if I knew what I would go through? Hell no. Because even after 4 years now, I love him more every day and would go through it all over again. I'd go through worse. 

That's what you deserve. That's the type of commitment, love, and relationship that you deserve. I know that it can be hard to see when the feelings are still so raw, when you still feel so rejected, but I promise you that you don't want to be with someone who doesn't take and love you for who you are....it never ends well. You don't want someone who is going to end up resenting you or being unable to accept this part of you. Unfortunately sometimes doing the right thing and respecting people's autonomy by disclosing ends in pain...but I hope that you see that what characterizes you in this situation is NOT your herpes, it's your integrity and your ability to do the right thing even when it came at a perceived cost to you. I say perceived because losing someone that isn't right for you is not a loss - its one of those tricky little benefits in disguise. If he can't see how the benefit of having you in his life would outweigh the statistically small chance of him getting herpes, then he's not the one, and he's definitely not someone worthy of being called the man of your dreams. And that's coming from someone who got the short end of the straw when it came to that statistically small chance. There is DEFINITELY someone out there for you who will gladly accept the risk every single day in order to be with you because he loves you. This is just a step in his direction. 

Best of luck, and lots of virtual hugs.",2022-04-05 22:58:58,16

Can’t blame him I guess in that it’s everyone’s choice but knowing what I know now about herpes (even though it’s a pain the butt) I wouldn’t not date someone just because they’ve got herpes. I’ve met my soulmate and it hasn’t deterred me.,2022-04-06 05:50:10,2

twzui3,"Hi. Thank you for this comment. I’m very happy for you finding the one but I’m sorry you ended up catching it even with the small chance. I would do the same. Nobody is ever going to be perfect and I couldn’t imagine a “flaw” such as this to stand in the way of a happy future. You are totally correct. I actually sent him a message a couple hours ago stating all this. That some connections are hard to come by but I never expected this to stand in the way. It was basically my Hail Mary. I haven’t gotten a response yet and don’t full expect to get one. I know this was hard for him too; he’s been extremely emotional about it because I know he feels strongly for me (but maybe not enough). Whichever way it goes, I know what’s meant to be is meant to be. This is a very disappointing chapter in my life but the story goes on… hard to think about right now but I know it will be ok again eventually. I wish you and your bf a lifetime of happiness. I’m glad you took the risk for him. Hope you recover quickly.",2022-04-05 23:07:39,5
twzui3,Just asking but did yall stop using condems or meds at any point before?,2022-04-06 00:29:14,1
twzui3,"Aw, this sucks so bad. I am so sorry that you're going through this. I sincerely hope that he responds to you one way or another so that you can at least get some closure if he decides to stick with his initial decision. How long ago did you disclose? Who knows, maybe he just needs some time to process all of this and sort out his feelings. If he's your person, he will choose you. If he's not, at least it sounds like he has been respectful and kind to your feelings as much as possible throughout this situation. 

I understand how he feels, having been in that position. I had to take some time too, not to decide whether I wanted to be with him, I knew I wanted that, but to reflect on what choosing that meant. I needed to take some time to make sure I understood and was okay with the risk, because I knew that if I wasn't and if I didn't in that moment commit to resolving him of any future blame if I contracted it, then I might end up resentful. Even though herpes isn't fatal, and even though the worst thing about it is the stigma, it's still a lot to take in. So I do believe that if he is the one, he will choose you. If he's not, you're better off if he doesn't. I know its super hard to think that way when you're still hurt, though. Some people just conduct their risk vs. benefit analyses differently, you know? You and I both clearly think that the future happiness a relationship could bring us is worth the possible downsides of living with herpes, but some people just don't see it that way, and it's not even about you at all. So if nothing else I hope that this doesn't keep you down or negatively impact your self-esteem for long.",2022-04-05 23:26:43,3

twzui3,"I know what I feels like to have that connection, how strong it can be. But just remember we also have a tendency to romanticize people and relationships. You’ve only been on four dates, and I know everything feels intense, but you don’t know him fully, as he doesn’t with you. What comes fast and burn the brightest, burns out quickly, I’ve learned. He sat you up on a pedestal, and by you disclosing, you fell off of that. And you’ve sat him on one as well. He’s probably an amazing human, but he’s still just a person. 
If he really wanted to be with you, then he would accept all of you. Him asking you to be his girlfriend that fast without even considering imperfect parts of you? That’s not a green flag. If he really wanted you to be he would accept all parts of you. And you deserve that. Someone that loves everything about you.
People fall in love with people that have deadly diseases, no matter how much it’s going to hurt them. People will die to be together. Go against all odds. They stay. If he can’t accept a mostly harmless disease in order to be with you, the love isn’t strong enough … that’s what I’m thinking at least.",2022-04-06 08:40:52,2

txn766,"This immunotherapy did have some success in individual case studies in the past, but when 3M ran clinical trials on it for HSV, it failed Phase 2.

At a high level, it is likely due to the fact that Aldara upregulates interferon alpha (a cytokine associated with the cellular immune response). However, research has shown that those who are asymptomatic have upregulated interferon gamma, not alpha. I’m simplifying quite a bit but in other words, Aldara doesn’t boost cellular immunity in a way that is effective for HSV.

What’s interesting though is that the individual case studies where it was successful were for those who had HIV and HSV at the same time. So it may indicate its efficacy in just those with HIV. 🤷

If you’re looking for an immunotherapy for HSV, you may look into squaric acid dibutylester (SADBE) which has successfully completed Phase 2 trials for HSV with Phase 3 trials currently recruiting. It boosts interferon gamma and enhances CD8+ T cell production, which is crucial in controlling HSV infection. Since it’s already used for HPV (like Aldara), it is available via an off-label prescription. I myself use it and have had superlative results. I used to get an outbreak every week. I am at a point now with the therapy where I can no longer induce an outbreak. I am completely asymptomatic.

I texted her yesterday bc I was having a really bad day and just want the Sadbe Rx. She said she is doing her homework.  I really respect her and I understand this is new for her and she just wants to make sure and research before she prescribes it to me. I am also having weekly outbreaks. I used to dread when I would get them every 3-4 months . And now it's every week. I'm growing very weary and pray that I can get Sadbe and it's my answer. I can't take much more .

But when you get “full” std/sti testing here they don’t even test for hsv. You have to ask for it special. When I was officially diagnosed with ghsv2 recently the doctor told me not to be so down on myself. As lots of people in Canada have both. He gave me the actual statistics for each, but I can’t remember them now. 
Apparently it’s largely believed that most people have it and live without symptoms in my age group. Especially people with penises.

Not everyone is educated and most are highly judgmental of such things. Myself (formerly) and basically everyone I know included.

I haven’t disclosed one because I’m new to the diagnosis and two the thought of a man right now makes me want to literally go into full rage but that’s not to say they aren’t accepting. 

If moving to Canada is something you are truly considering, don’t let ur status stop you from doing that. Apparently there is great work being done to find a cure. But don’t stop

txgfve,"Have you been having outbreaks, and have you been able to look inside your vagina to ensure that you’re not actually having open sores present internally when this happens? Is it only painful during and after sex, or also before? This happened to me quite a few times, but upon inspection I realized it was because I indeed did have sores pretty far up inside my vagina. That’s the only place I get them, I don’t get external sores. So my advice would be to take a mirror and do a quick once over of the visible parts of the inside of your vagina, or you can also use a cell phone with flash to take pictures. If you’re not able to see any visible sores then I would suggest scheduling an appointment with an OBGYN just to ensure that you’re not getting outbreaks on your cervix and to rule out other issues. I’ve had a whole boat load of weird symptoms since I was diagnosed so I can’t say with certainty that it isn’t possible that herpes would be causing this even during the (otherwise) asymptomatic stages of the virus, but I would definitely get it checked out if you’re confident you’re not having an active outbreak. I hope you get to the bottom of it soon, best of luck.",2022-04-06 09:00:09,1

txddey,I was once asked to be interviewed for an article about HSV and decided to allow them to publish my name in it.  That's about as far as I've gone.  Didnt really get much traction though and I dont think any of my friends read it.  I dont encounter public shaming or joking of it like I used to when I was younger,2022-04-06 12:05:09,1
txddey,"I've been pretty open about my status. When my dating profiles were active I would have my GHSV-1 status on it. If I am having struggles about it mentally, I'll reach out on Facebook about it and I've had sit down conversations events through my meetup group where we hang out at a cafe and I'll start the table conversation with, ""What do you know about Herpes?""

However, I have heard stories about people that need time to get used to the idea of HSV and eventually feel less worried about it as they get more comfortable, so maybe this will be the case? If you really like this person, maybe it's worth waiting but I don't believe you're wrong for feeling the way you do based on your experience. I don't think you'd be wrong to leave the relationship for that reason either.",2022-04-05 22:32:23,8

tx2yr2,"I don’t think you’re wrong for feeling disheartened. I would feel self-conscious about myself if my partner was really concerned about catching it. When getting into the relationship and you telling him on the third date was good. It’s good he even took the step of educating himself and asking questions. He should have a better understanding of how it can be contracted. And if he’s that concerned can even talk to his doctor about it. 
Have HSV2 has become a more common thing, and the stigma behind it is dumb. If he cannot come to terms with you having it and not acting so weird when having a small scare I don’t think he is the one.

txew5a,"Does she have HSV1?? 

I think you’re a little confused. HSV1 and HSV2 are two different things. HSV2 typically lives in the genital area while HSV1 typically lives in the mouth. However, HSV1 can be both on the mouth or the genitals depending on how you contract it. It’s less likely with HSV2. 

If you were to go down on her, and she had an open sore, the only thing you would MAYYYBE get would be HSV2 orally which is highly unlikely because that type likes the genitals, not the mouth. Like highlyyyy unlikely, especially considering you have HSV2 already. If she doesn’t have an outbreak then you’re clear. And you already have herpes and so does she soooo fuck it?

You won’t get HSV1 or a second form of herpes from her if she doesn’t have it to begin with.",2022-04-06 05:44:30,2

Before going to Reddit for advice on this, please go to see a doctor. They will swab the area and run an STD panel. Ask specifically for them to test for herpes. I know you didn’t attach a photo, but STDs in general can look like a million different things. It’s more stressful to post your photo of your genitals and have the world commenting about what they THINK it is vs getting a diagnosis.

This doesn't sound at all like herpes, raised painful sores are the norm, maybe you just had a run-in with your partner's teeth. 

Doctors are flat out indifferent to herpes and even discourage testing because the virus is medically innocuous for the vast majority of people. Knowing you're positive is an unrelenting hell, do not buy any of the pharmaceutical tv ad bs. The virus isn't the end of your dignity as a person, but it as absolutely a social impediment and psychological millstone. If I hadn't been all but certain of being positive and just curious about what strain I had, I would not have tested. You and your partner risk herpes every time you have protected penetrative sex and even more so when you have oral because you're 99.9% not using barriers for that. Your choice is between the hell world of being a known positive and continuing to play herpes roulette in a culture that doesn't care enough to test for it routinely but makes your life measurably harder if you know your status.",2022-04-06 04:37:18,4

tww0pv,"I disclosed to the girl I’m seeing now after talking to her on Hinge for two hours. She said “I don’t think we can be anything more than friends”. 

At first I was thinking that I didn’t want anything to do with her- but IMO the worst part of herpes or any rejection for that matter is the feeling of loneliness that ensues. I took up her offer and hung out at her apartment as her first ever platonic male friend. That night we get drunk and kiss each other. The next day she messages me and tells me something that she’s embarrassed to admit- she MISSES me and felt like she could truly be herself around me. 

We’re dating now. We’ve slept in the same bed countless times and are taking it slow to see if we’re compatible for one another.

My advice - if she’s still wanting to see you she may well be figuring you out - she’s likely never had to be in this situation and wants to see if you’re a long-term possibility for her. Be her friend, keep hanging out with her. At worst you two will be real good friends (you yourself may find that you’re not compatible with her long term); at best it might develop into something more and she may admit she made a “rash” decision. I joke with my gf now about that.",2022-04-05 19:55:56,6

tx1jum,"Antivirals interrupt the viruses ability to replicate, but it's possible you have a strain that is resistant. Ask your doc for a different oral, and also for topical acyclovir. I have something similar and that helps.

Also, I have been telling people to try diaper rash cream. It works good for me, better than topical acyclovir. A couple of people have told me it helped them too. Use the max strength with 40% zinc oxide.

Watch your diet, peanut butter and chocolate in any amounts trigger an immediate & brutal outbreak for me. I take 25 mg of zinc every day (with food, or else upset stomach) and sometimes vitamin c. 

A lot of people swear by lysine pills, so try that out. I think lysine only helps if you accidentally ate something high in arginine, like peanut butter - but that's just a theory.

Lastly - get sleep! It's fucking hard. But sleep helps your immune system a LOT. If I sleep less than 6 hours then it's most likely going to trigger an outbreak.",2022-04-05 18:43:49,2

With the way most people aren’t even aware that hsv tests aren’t included in std panels makes it hard to know sometimes. Even with testing, you could get false results from blood, meaning the only fully accurate way is to be swabbed. Which you need an outbreak for. I promise you, it’s not the end of the world and it does not ruin anything for you. You are still YOU. Regardless of this skin condition. Out of all herpes, ghsv1 is the least contagious with low transmission rates. It sheds 4% of the year. After 2 years it’s about 4 days a year if that. As long as you don’t have an active outbreak, I think you’re fine and won’t pass it. Also protection helps with that risk as well. More than half the world has hsv1… so that being said even if you didn’t get it from this person who lied, you were more than likely to get it later on from someone else.

Also, it's spread skin to skin, so you didn't necessarily need to have anal sex for it to pop up there. If there was rubbing in that area, a mouth, a finger, etc. it can easily spread.

Also, I would take an icy pop and wrap it in a cloth and put it between my cheeks while I’m bed. Ice helped relieve the pain for me more than anything.

twzejn,"Guy here, never been rejected because of hsv. I wait for the 3rd date typically and see if I want to genuinely keep seeing them. By that point I'm not so attached that I'll be heartbroken if they were to reject me, but I know enough about them/their character to feel safe disclosing. If they are immature, judgemental, unkind or gossipy then I don't bother and bail. 

People will suggest either in person or via text. Whilst it might seem less personal over text, that's why I do it that way. Every girl I've told has later told me she was thankful firstly for telling her and secondly for doing it over text as they felt it took the pressure off them. There's always about a max 24 hour period of them going off the boil to some degree as they go away and research it, but once they've sat on it a while they are generally very OK and have a couple of questions.

Don't send a massive essay, just keep it brief and to the point; confident and don't come across like you have the plague, because you do not. Usually something along the lines of ""hey I'm really enjoying getting to know you but there's something I need to let you know if you want to continue this relationship with me"". Then I tell them and I say that most people aren't educated about it, that it's very common and I explain what the logistics are of dating with hsv (that its mostly safe to have sex). Then I let her know I respect her and wouldn't hold it against her if this has changed things for her/it's a deal breaker. I finish by saying I'm cool with talking about it whenerever she would like and happy to answer any questions she has. The only thing I would ask is that we keep this on a need to know, and to please not tell anyone so as to respect my privacy because its very personal to me.",2022-04-05 18:49:30,2
twzejn,"Not a guy, but I disclosed to someone I’ve been seeing and could potentially see myself dating. I just told them flat out my diagnosis, what I’m doing to manage it and lessen chances of OBs/transmission. And talked ab how it’s really not as bad as society/pop culture has made it out to be. You need to be confident in your delivery to make them feel comfortable as well. He took it v well and started doing his own research/education w out me telling him to. Do it when you feel ready and comfortable w the person. If there’s no potential at all, then don’t feel obligated to disclose.",2022-04-05 18:30:02,1

twzabc,"Please don't jump to conclusions like this. It's *extremely* difficult to catch genital herpes without engaging in sexual activity: either intercourse or receiving oral sex. All sorts of other things might cause symptoms of various sorts on the labia, or within the genital region in general.

You didn't provide any photos or describe your symptoms in accordance with the sub [Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/wiki/symptom_questions), so no one will be able to suggest what might be going on here. But if you've never been sexually active then it's *extremely* unlikely to be herpes.

I would suggest you go to the doctor and be clear: ""I've never had sex, or even received oral sex, or even kissed, so I'm not sure what to make of these symptoms."" It is very, very likely to be a non-STD issue.",2022-04-05 20:00:07,2

tww87z,"Both me and my partner had such bad friction burns we almost went to the urgent care that initial time, and we both actually later tested negative for herpes in STD tests, so I think it was just youthful stupidity and an open wound near a few large lymph nodes. The wound was open for several days for me too, so if you tested negative maybe you dont have it? My lymph nodes were swollen during the wound being open and until the end where the scabs were close to coming off, so quite a while (and even a bit painful for a couple days), and a secondary infection could have caused it to flare up again after the skin closed in your case.

I initially thought the HSV sores this time around were a similar friction burn from masturbation or something, but it wasn't just skin coming off and scabbing over in the spot I rubbed against, they were blisters that turned into leisons - on top of an STD test coming back positive for HSV1.

twja0r,"The vast majority of those with HSV-2 are completely asymptomatic their entire life. This is because these individuals have a strong cellular immune response in which interferon gamma is up regulated and CD8+ T cells are generated.

Those with symptomatic HSV have poor cellular immunity in which interferon gamma is down regulated and T cell production is minimized.

tvqwxp,"Love this! I hope this gets boosted more because I feel like a general consensus in the herpes community is that people will no longer find you desirable and will reject you as soon as you disclose.

Me: so, this isn’t easy to discuss for me, but I have herpes. I take medicine that reduces the outbreaks and chance to pass it on, but it isn’t 100% effective every time. Feel free to ask me any questions you would like

Her: Shit happens in life (then tells me about a time she caught a curable STD in college)

Her: why did you decide to tell me?

Me: I wanted to be honest and key know the whole truth before we did anything. I’ve had relationships/sex since I’ve had it before. 

Her: (asked a few other questions but can’t remember what she asked)

Her: Thank you for being honest, let’s take a shot you look kinda tense ( I laughed out loud lol)

Me: *Takes shot* *she does the same*

Her: Can we have sex with a condom?

twlz85,"If you aren’t comfortable yet then don’t. Do some research and use protection. Ask her if she’s on anti virals and if she’s having an outbreak. I believe there is less than 1% chance of catching herpes in the entire year if you use condoms, have your partner get on medication, and avoid having sex during outbreaks. Chances are you’re more likely to catch it from another girl who doesn’t know she has it than from her.",2022-04-05 04:25:12,8

twlz85,"Its up to you, the shedding rate of hsv 2 is around 20 %

Meaning that means that in a year (365 days) a person sheds around 73 days

You can reduce the viral shedding with daily valacyclavere (needs to be taken for  5 days to reach full potency) it reduces the shedding rate by up to 78 % 

Meaning that shedding happens around 16 days a year

With condoms on top of daily meds , it further reduces the risk of u catching it by up to 30 %

Wich makes u catching herpes in a year around 3 to 4 percent 

Which per sexual event reduces it to very low.. however only if u use condoms + daily antivirals

Imo, if she's not the person you want to spend the rest of your life with. it wouldn't be worth it..",2022-04-05 05:40:12,5

tw12aj,"You are safe regardless. HSV does not kill you or essentially harm you. It’s a virus that lives in your nerves and may or may not show up, especially in healthy individuals. 

If you use protection, and she takes meds, your chances are very very slim. You are fine, and if you like this girl and feel good about sex with her, then go for it. I have a friend whom I mess around with, unprotected, he knows about my HSV, and he never caught it. I think it’s because the virus is dormant most of the time for me. 

Anyway, you are safe, and asking for advice in general means you care for this person already, and I applaud you for being a gentleman. Most people will catch herpes in their lifetime, and there’s a huge stigma on it for no reason. Good luck!",2022-04-04 23:00:55,6

Also, if herpes is non-life threatening and won’t kill you then why is it contagious? I kinda never really understood that.",2022-04-05 02:06:14,0
tw12aj,"Less than that. It's about 1% in a year for 2-3 sex acts per week. In addition, most people with HSV2 are asymptomatic, so if you ever contract it you will likely never have any symptoms.",2022-04-04 13:53:24,11

I had meningitis with my first outbreak because I didn't have HSV1 to slightly protect myself from HSV2 (HSV1 doesn't protect you outright but it makes you 3x likely to be asymptomatic). I had 4 breakouts in the first year, none since (or none that I see). Take Valtrex daily and lysine and you'll be fine.

It's like chickenpox; the virus stays in your body forever but you will likely have fewer and less severe outbreaks and they will subside entirely eventually.",2022-04-04 17:45:35,4

tw12aj,"Ah, in that case your reaction is understandable. She violated your trust and your ability to make a choice. That happened to me but with a woman who I was in a relationship with - I would have said yes to her btw, because with her taking precautions and not having sex during an outbreak a man's chance of contracting it within a YEAR is 1% (if you have 2-3 sex acts per week using antivirals and condoms).

Did she say which strain she has?

In any case, you 99.999999% don't have it and likely wouldn't for years if ever if you had pursued a relationship with her.

Also, over 80% of cases are asymptomatic, meaning it's very likely if you ever contracted herpes from her or someone else, you would never know unless you got tested. You're statistically safer with someone who knows their status. If you're scared of contracting herpes, just know that over 2/3 of the population has a strain of it in one form or another (cold sores on the genitals are the same as on the mouth, just a different place).",2022-04-04 16:26:09,1

tw12aj,"And if she has it?

Again, you HAVE it. Just another strain (HSV1). Have any symptoms? No? Neither do I anymore (for 2 years) and I have HSV2. The symptoms for almost everyone are negligible; the worst part is dealing with others' assumptions about the infection. 50 years ago, this wasn't even considered abnormal.

tw12aj,HSV1. HSV1 and 2 can occur genitally AND/OR orally. Half of new genital herpes cases are caused by people with HSV1. HSV1 can asymptomatically shed even with no sores or history of sores; meaning you could give someone genital herpes.,2022-04-04 17:42:21,1
tw12aj,"I get it. Believe me, I do. I'm seeing a woman right now who is HSV negative to her knowledge (she hasn't been tested). She initially turned me down after I told her the first night we talked over Hinge (big mistake); then I hang with her as a platonic friend the first time and voila we've been dating for almost two months. She also disclosed to me the other night that she has lupus (she is immunocompromised and could have more severe outbreaks if she got it). However, with the proper precautions, she will never likely get it.

Just about everyone on this subreddit (which by the way is a microcosm of the herpes community given how large it is) is going through some type of depression because they got it from someone who DIDN'T disclose. If someone makes the choice to be with you, it's natural to feel guilty, but it's also a great sign this person likes you. My girlfriend made her choice, even with her autoimmune disorder, to continue dating me.

What if the girl you really like tells you she has herpes too?",2022-04-04 17:55:00,1
tw12aj,"Yeah I feel for the people that did have a choice

I think I confused you

The girl who has herpes was a one night stand and there’s a girl I’m talking to now that doesn’t have it you get me ?


That’s why I was asking about my risk and the transmission rate , wouldn’t want to give it to this new girl that I like in case I have it",2022-04-04 17:59:33,2
tw12aj,"Unless she's shown you her STD panel including herpes, you have NO idea that she doesn't have it.

In any case, you're almost certainly negative for HSV2.

Again (and I want to make this CLEAR) - YOU HAVE HERPES. HSV1 can be oral or genital. If you're asymptomatic and have never had cold sores, you do not know if it's oral or genital. If she does not have HSV1 or HSV2, you can GIVE HER genital herpes or oral herpes with your HSV1.

The chances are extremely low, but still possible and something you need to disclose. It's not something that should result in her rejecting you if HSV1 (considering how many have it), and if she does, she's an idiot quite frankly.",2022-04-04 18:06:43,2

twk0ns,After 6 years of infection she’s a fraction as contagious as someone giving you a blow job with ohsv1. The risk isn’t 0% but unless your asking every single person that goes near your junk to get tested then that risk will never be 0% because that’s just how common herpes is a good majority of people have it somewhere.,2022-04-05 07:22:16,2

twhw4s,"Water infected with herpes is not a thing. Saliva, along with semen is a terrible carrier of herpes and unlikely.

You mentioned he has had a cold sore for 14 days - presumably it has started to heal by day 14, in which case hes at the end of the outbreak and the likelihood of the virus being active on the skin by that point is low. (That's why swabs need to be done ASAP when symptoms start, since the virus may not be present by the time healing begins).

Further to that, even IF the saliva had been carrying the virus and was in the water from 14 days ago, or when his viral load was at it highest, the herpes virus cannot live outside of the body very long - it would be dead in a matter of hours and impossible to infect. This is especially the case given its been sitting in water for 2 weeks.

>We never kiss during outbreak, and wait about a month to kiss again.

There is something called viral shedding, which means that even without outbreaks, or any visible shedding, your husband could be contagious at any given time, Oral hsv1 sheds about 25% of days [in those with recurrent cold sores](https://westoverheights.com/forum/question/hsv1-8/). This means that waiting a month after a cold sore means nothing. 

Here's a sort of similar situation - [https://westoverheights.com/forum/question/random-scenario-i-am-worried-about/](https://westoverheights.com/forum/question/random-scenario-i-am-worried-about/)

The dilution of the virus in water, should there actually be any in the water, would have make it unable to transmit.

twhw4s,"When I read things by people who anecdotally claim they caught hsv through saliva, I take it with a heavy dose of salt honestly- not saying its impossible I just think its very, very unlikely. There are far more credible people, for example Terri Warren on her forum at Westover Heights, who are more compelling - yes, technically anecdotal but she comes with 35+ years of experience in seeing herpes cases.

As mentioned, if he spat in the water on day 14, he would need to have thrown it within hours or it'd be dead. But again, if he did this on day 14, the liklihood of there being any viral load in his saliva by that point is very, very low. I do not think you have cause for concern.

You're way more likely to have kissed him without symptoms (but whilst he was still shedding) and picked it up that way. And if you do end up testing positive, your results may not show as postive for at least 12 weeks. If you tested postive via a blood test tomorrow for instance, it would be because you were infected possibly 12 weeks previously and not from this water bottle incident.

I'm really confused why he would be activiely spitting into a bottle every day. Or are you referring to ""backwash"" from simply drinking from the bottle? If the latter, your risk is even less.

twd5vq,"Pasting a previous comment.

I'm a 29M and have had HSV2 for over three years. HSV2 commonly affects the genitals but can be oral as well; HSV1, while preferring the mouth, is responsible for up to half of new genital herpes infections. I've had a total of four outbreaks (all in the first year). I haven't had any outbreaks since. This is how it is even for a vast majority of people that get this. Over 80% of people that contract HSV2 NEVER have ANY symptoms and are out there spreading this because they have no idea they have it. An estimated 1/6 Americans have HSV2. For those who have symptoms at first, the outbreaks decrease with severity and amount and eventually will cease entirely. Most of the horror stories on here are the exception, not the rule - I would say probably 5-10% of the people who get herpes are likely immunocompromised and suffer recurrent outbreaks - which can easily be managed with antivirals. It is, as is often described, a skin infection - one that doesn't decrease your lifespan or really affect your ability to have children (neonatal herpes being passed through childbirth is 3 times less likely than you giving birth to a child with down syndrome).

Having this myself, I can say that this is NOT a big deal at all and I do not get the stigma surrounding it. That's really the only problem IMO about having this - others' assumptions and stereotypes about the infection. I will say this - of course, for a guy, the symptoms aren't as painful because if we do get sores, they tend to be outside versus inside. It's very possible you already have it or HSV1. Ironically, if this guy ONLY has HSV2 and didn't ever have HSV1 and you did, YOU could have given him genital herpes. I am in this boat, I tested negative for HSV1 when I got tested a few months back for my HSV negative partner.

If you all have 2-3 sex acts per week, there is about a 10% chance of you acquiring the virus in a given year (this is without protection). Again, if you contract it - there is an over 80% chance you never get ANY symptoms. Daily antivirals reduce the chances to about 5% per year. Condoms, conservatively, reduce the chances by another 50%; however there is research by Teri Warren that shows condom use may reduce transmission rates from M to F by up to 96%. Conservatively, the use of antivirals AND condoms will result in a 2.5% yearly chance - but we may be talking well under 1% due to condom use with antivirals. Oral with HSV2 is generally safe as it does not like the mouth area, but is still possible (but under 1%); use a condom at first if you're not comfortable. Also, the longer he has it, the less he sheds the virus. If he's asymptomatic (doesn't have outbreaks anymore) this also leads to a reduction in overall shedding. People without symptoms shed less on average than those that still get outbreaks. Asymptomatic shedding (with no sores) IS responsible for up to 70% of transmissions, so YES, that IS possible, but again, this is hindered by taking daily antivirals and condoms.

The vast majority of us on here that got it (90%+) was NOT from someone who disclosed and was honest with us; it was from someone who didn't know they had it OR KNEW AND LIED/NEVER TOLD. I was in the second boat; my ex-girlfriend knew she had it and didn't tell me out of fear I would have rejected her. If she had told me, I would have not have rejected her; her being honest with me and showing me all the precautions would have been a massive green flag for me and by taking those precautions I VERY LIKELY would not have it today.

For the few that have contracted it after taking the risk and when given the choice, the anecdotes I've seen from people is that they didn't contract it until years into the relationship - which at that point I would imagine most people are happily married and don't care anymore.

This guy is presumably looking for a long-term relationship and by telling you this is communicating his desire to be honest with you, even with the chance that you turn him down as a result. Clearly, he's not looking to lie to you or mislead for the possibility of cheap sex; so many people pass this on or lie about it just to get laid. Consider that a MASSIVE GREEN FLAG.

Still, if you're hesitant, I recommend taking it slow with him and getting to know if you two are compatible. Sex is good, sex is great; but I'm taking it slow with a woman who is HSV negative right now because I desire so much more. Sounds like he does too",2022-04-05 20:34:12,1

twd45s,What are your iGG levels?,2022-04-04 21:32:27,1
twd45s,Hey seen similar posts on this forum. Seems like other people have been getting odd blood test results after booster :),2022-04-04 22:57:53,1
twd45s,"What prompted you to get a blood test?

An igG of 20 is high and pretty conclusive indicator that you are positive for hsv2. It is not a low positive result.

The vast majority of HSV positive people are completely asymptomatic. You may have had such a mild outbreak in the past that you missed it, or you may just never have had an outbreak before despite having the virus. Some people will never have an outbreak, others may have their first outbreaks months or even years after being exposed.

I think the likelihood in this situation is you slept with someone who had hsv2 and either didn't know or didn't say and you contracted it that way.

A blood test can only tell you if you have the virus, it cannot tell you when you acquired it or what location you have it in. You may even have oral hsv2, which is not very likely, but possible.",2022-04-05 16:05:50,1

twd45s,About 46 yrs ago I MAY have had a minor outbreak. Back then there was no Google to do a self diagnosis - HSV was not well known. Since then I have had a few very long term partners (wives!).

twd45s,"I think that's your most likely answer in all honesty.

Hsv2 outbreaks can tend to become less frequent and severe over time. There's a lot of variables here regarding your partners - they may have had hsv2 themselves, they may have got lucky and never contracted it (asymptomatic hsv2 has an even lower chance of transmission versus symptomatic hsv2 - meaning you're at a lower risk of passing it on), or perhaps they did contract it but showed no symptoms or just didn't mention it.",2022-04-05 16:20:41,1

also i asked this same question on another subreddit and someone replied saying if you've had oral hsv1 for 6 months + then the chances of getting ghsv1 is lower because you have antibodies",2022-04-04 21:10:54,1
twci55,"Most of that is correct, yes. Ghsv1 sheds less and is less likely to be transmitted because of the location when it comes to genital to genital. But, if you have genital hsv1 and someone preforms oral on you I believe the risk is a bit higher but still pretty low. (If there’s no outbreak of course) . Some people have the initial outbreak then never again yes, others have more but I hear it drops after a year. I was just diagnosed in February so I’m not sure yet how mine will be. I had my initial one and I think another but it was because I shaved. I’m also not on daily medication. BUT when it comes to the part about it being less dangerous.. I believe herpes is herpes. Regardless of the location or being 1or2. I don’t think one is better than the other, but 1 sheds less than 2 yes. Just depends on the way you look at it! Hsv1 is just more common",2022-04-04 21:20:39,1

But ultimately it’s your decision if you want to disclose genital herpes or not. If he’s willing he’ll look past it.,2022-04-04 22:00:10,1
twc2ed,"Hello <3

I'm actually in a very similar boat. Not the EXACT same situation but boy can I seriously relate to you hard core right now Dx

I got out of a 6 year relationship a year ago (my ex never got hsv2 from me btw) and for the first time a couple weeks ago I actually met someone and something new began to bloom.

This new guy was so great we vibed and flowed so well ever since the day we met we had been talking back and forth all day everyday. I ended up going to his place...I planned on just cuddling but one thing happened after another I got caught up in the heat of the moment and the sex happened. I fucked up cos I didnt disclose my status. I rarely ever get outbreaks and I know that even without symptoms its possible to pass the virus along....but I never intended to have sex with him it just happened. UGH! The guilt was eating away at me! I fucked up so bad :""( I was starting to get attached and really liking him too...but I knew he deserved to know the truth. How could it ever amount to anything REAL if I kept this hidden?  It was SO HARD to tell him...felt like one of the most difficult things I've ever had to do. Naturally he freaked the fuck out and eventually after many FUCK FUCK FUUUCCCCKKs ended up saying he has to go process this and that was that. I immediately broke down after that call. I imagine he probably hates me and wants nothing to do with me now.

It really fucking sucks but I know I did the right thing. I was so ashamed for hiding my deepest darkest secret. It literally made me sick keeping that from him. Now that I told him I feel like I regained a little bit of integrity cos I owned up to my mistake, apologized to him and I spoke my truth. Yes of course it hurts knowing that I probably lost him for good. But its also a really important and harsh lesson for us both. Next time I am DEFINITELY just gonna be up front about myself as hard as it is...the alternative (this experience) is WORSE. And I really dont want to go through this ever again.

Youre not a horrible person and youre not alone.

In fact, that is not true, it actually designates the strain of herpes Simplex virus. 
Normally there is a G (genital) or a O (oral) infront which designates location. For example: Ghsv1, Ohsv1 or Ghsv2
Understand ?",2022-04-06 01:31:45,1
twc2ed,"Exactly, if this was gshv-2 I'd absolutely no doubt know I need to say something because in the event that I did pass that to them, there would be a decent chance that they could then pass the virus to someone else genitally. I'm only considering sparing this person of this trauma because no one really cares about getting oral hsv and the transmission rate of ghsv-1 is signifiacntly lower than any other type. Even if they got it from me and passed it on to someone else it would likely be passed orally. I think I'm going to not mention it.  There's less than a 1% chance that I passed it to them, and if that 1% actually happened there's also a seriously low chance that they'd pass it to any future partners genitally.

tw0exv,"I’m so sorry you’re going through this, when did you first contract HSV? Is it type 1 or 2? If you have only recently contracted it then it can take a while for your immune system to fight it, and once you start to build immunity over time the outbreaks should become much less frequent. Are you under a lot of stress and what is your diet like? Do you take anything to build your immunity? And you should definitely start taking lysine too. 
Could you ask your doctor for a referral to see a gynaecologist (are you female?) or another type of specialist. Or take a higher dose of the meds? 
Also, there are currently human trials underway for a GHSV2 vaccine so there is some hope.

THEN you discuss the results. You are not a bad person at all. People who have oral herpes go around kissing and giving oral without a 2nd thought to disclosing.  If you lived in the time before valtrex launched their fear mongering ad campaign you wouldn't be thinking about this just like the millions who have it and are asymptomatic. And the millions more who carry it orally.,2022-04-04 15:11:58,2
tvxdz5,Well … don’t be surprised if he doesn’t get with you. Anyone in their right mind should run. You’re the asshole people worry about.,2022-04-04 18:41:47,2
tvxdz5,"Don’t listen to the negative comments. I haven’t hooked up with someone yet since I was diagnosed but I’ve thought about how I’m going to disclose or what I’m gonna do. Yes ideally you probably should’ve just said it upfront but I totally get being scared and not wanting him to not give you a chance because if it. Atleast you did tell him instead of continuing to lie, and you did literally everything you could to keep him safe from getting it (most people Definitely don’t take all the precautions that you did if they haven’t disclosed I bet) So don’t beat yourself up you’re not a bad person everyone deals with things differently and discloses differently. Your not an asshole and if he loves you and really knows the type of person you are I think he’ll overlook it ❤️",2022-04-04 19:07:36,2
tvxdz5,"I’m convinced in the real world very few people ever admit their herpes status.  You did the right thing-but his reaction shows why people don’t admit it.  People don’t want to lose out on love.  Think of all the marriages that could have been.  I believe that disclosure is the right thing to do-but I completely understand why people don’t do it, especially when 90 percent of the global population has either HSV-1 and HSV-2 and both cause genital herpes-no one expects them to disclose because it’s not tested for!!",2022-04-05 02:51:45,2
tvxdz5,"His reason for leaving was your lack of communication, and that was before he found our you were actively keeping status from him. For sure worth you working on you. Finding a way to learn better skills with communication. Counseling or something else. No matter this relationship or not. Not disclosing is a choice, but coupled with difficulty communication, likely to present more issues down the road.at least consider",2022-04-04 12:57:18,1
tvxdz5,I think some of us have been there before. You told him eventually when he wanted to restart something. Plus you had 6 months together already. Is there any update on this? Did he get tested?,2022-04-05 21:05:17,1
tvxdz5,Thanks for the feedback!,2022-04-04 19:12:47,1
tvxdz5,Do you feel rhe same about oral hsv?,2022-04-04 15:15:43,2
tvxdz5,That’s something I will have to live with is that I betrayed his trust to someone I very much love and care for. But this HSV virus has ruined me mentally and has caused me to not disclose. I’m hoping he will look past it but if not then I totally get it.,2022-04-04 19:12:08,0
tvxdz5,Wow! That’s so great to hear! Glad it all worked out for you,2022-04-04 20:50:06,1
tvxdz5,Not that I know of yet. I know it takes some time get back results and that blood tests aren’t accurate but i know it’s going to give him a piece of mind. And from this experience I definitely learned a hard lesson and I’m still feeling the consequences of it.,2022-04-04 19:07:32,1
tvxdz5,I agree 100% that I’m the asshole and I’ve already stated that in the post that I am the worst person ever. I already know the consequences of my actions and I am ready for the repercussions. In the end I am human. I am young. And I make mistakes.,2022-04-04 19:09:19,1
tvxdz5,"Thank you for the kind words. I like to think that I’m a nice asshole haha. But if I can offer some word of advice from a nice asshole, take as much time as you need before engaging in sex, and use condoms and get on daily anti virals. It’ll give your and your partner a piece of mind and some protection. And don’t do what I did and wait too long to disclose. I learned that the hard way.",2022-04-04 19:26:46,1
tvxdz5,"Couldn’t have said it better myself. I hope that whoever is on this Reddit page sees this and understand that shit happens and that’s just how it is sometimes.

I definitely hope that he loves me enough to move past it but it if not that’s cool too. Que sera, sera",2022-04-05 03:59:23,2
tvxdz5,The thing is that we initially broke up bc of his lack of communication and vulnerability. But in my end it’s also my fault for not being upfront about it.,2022-04-04 19:05:31,1
tvxdz5,No update so far. I did send him a message asking if he’s ok. If he gets back to me I’ll leave an update under your comment,2022-04-05 21:41:06,2
tvxdz5,Oral hsv can spread genitally so it should be a conversation prior to oral if the carrier is aware of their status and aware that it can be spread genitally. Withholding that information from anyone while aware of the risks yourself is unfair.,2022-04-04 15:24:16,2
tvxdz5,"There are people on here who vilify and attack those who don’t disclose, or disclose too late, or whatever and just dehumanize them.  In reality most adults have some form of herpes simplex on their body and are spreading it to partners, but people don’t have symptoms or misunderstand them.  But the people here never attack them, or the public health system that recommends not testing for herpes, or just the general ignorance of humanity surrounding herpes.  People like you are low hanging fruit-easy to crucify.  But it isn’t fair, nor logical.  I hope everything works out for you",2022-04-05 04:16:20,2
tvxdz5,Thanks for clarafication,2022-04-05 00:27:32,1
tvxdz5,I’m curious as to what he decides because I had a similar situation lol sending positive vibes your way.,2022-04-07 22:41:15,1
tvxdz5,"Shouldn’t it apply before every kiss too?  Because if you kiss a new partner and you carry oral HSV you could be giving them oral HSV as well, which could then turn into someone’s genital HSV.  

I’m not being serious here just making a logical point-the world is not going to stop and have the oral herpes disclosure talk before every first date kiss-even though, From a logical and scientific viewpoint spreading oral herpes leads to more genital herpes. But no one really cares and no one is going to do anything about it lol",2022-04-05 05:14:18,1
tvxdz5,"No updates so far. It’s been a week since this all happened and I kind of think he’s ghosting me. So I decided to just move on.

If there are other updates I’ll post it here",2022-04-08 01:26:42,1
tw5qr7,Valtrex use condoms and sex w no ob. Less then 1% chance of transmission,2022-04-05 05:11:43,2
tw5qr7,Omggg I also still have itchiness and just an ill feeling after a month. I’m getting so freaking annoyed and frustrated meanwhile the person who gave it to me is refusing to get tested and could care less that they did this. Most likely knew about their status and played dumb. I’m so uncomfortable and I wish this would end :(,2022-04-05 13:05:47,1

tvu1gx,"I was diagnosed last year in June with ghsv-1 and I cried so hard and was so worried that I would end up being like the last cat at the RSPCA who wasn’t adopted. 

But I found my boyfriend in July and I told him about it and he went away and did he research, and was all good with it, and now we are ethically non-monogamous and I’ve disclosed to all possible partners that I have it. All reactions have been totally okay and last night I just had my first ‘I like you but can’t have a sexual relationship with you right now’ blow-off and it’s taken a bit of an emotional toll on me, but I understand, I would be scared too. 
I think it’s just getting them to realise that they don’t ask every person who sucks their dick if they have ever had cold sores before, and that you have less chance of getting hsv-1 from me than kissing anyone random at a club.",2022-04-04 14:35:35,2

tvtk9n,Yes tho the hpv happened much earlier,2022-04-04 05:31:18,2
tvtk9n,Yes. I do. GW and GHSV2. Got genital warts in 2018 but I was very young so I can't find out what type as I am not 21 yet to do the test :/. I'm 20. Haven't had any reappear after being diagnosed until I've gotten herpes. Since then have been having genital warts reoccurring non stop. Only go a week or so without them. I've gotten herpes in sep 2021.,2022-04-04 11:16:20,1
tvtk9n,So did mine. I was diagnosed with hsv in December and with hpv in 2018. Have had normal paps. I’m scared hsv will make it worse again,2022-04-04 05:39:01,1
tvtk9n,I had a Leep done and have had normal paps ever since. It’s about time for me to get another pap and I am so nervous,2022-04-04 14:18:09,1
tvtk9n,Don't worry. I've been told that if it is gone it's gone. Getting herpes for me has just not been so well for my immune system in general (I've had other issues since but it is becoming better). If you still test positive it is not that bad. There's actually a group on here for hpv too if you're interested. Many people have it for years until it goes away finally. Some things could obs make it harder for your immune system to get rid of it but it will still go away after a while :). Remember to take care of yourself.,2022-04-04 14:27:11,1

Seriously, unless a food triggers you, don't avoid it. I've had herpes since 2004 and haven't ever altered my diet for it. Avocado is good for you. Don't avoid it unless it triggers you.",2022-04-04 15:46:11,3
tw39uk,"A lot of very healthy foods are sadly high in arginine. Most people will recommend to not adjust your diet unless you notice that certain foods trigger it for you. 

It might not be the food that is triggering it for you. 

You can also take lysine if you don't want to adjust your diet as it helps to break arginine so if you take more of lysine than arginine you should be good :).",2022-04-04 14:39:05,3
tw39uk,I eat a lot of avos so I don’t think they should affect you. Also unless your body is freaky sensitive you don’t have to go overboard making sure everything doesn’t have a lot of arginine.

I only got sores with my first OB - since then I just get the fluish symptoms as well as the no appetite. I take Valtrex daily for suppressive therapy, so I conclude having no blisters other than my initial OB is because I take the antiviral daily. I’m not sexually active, and I just went 10 days with not taking it and felt great. But my period is coming so I’m taking it just in case. I really wouldn’t restrict your diet - chocolate is a hit or miss for me. For me it’s really just sex, poor sleep, periods before or after, and hit or miss with chocolate. Since you’re on an antiviral I wouldn’t worry too much, the antiviral stops it before it develops into sores for many people including myself. Hope this helps!",2022-04-05 00:34:51,1

It’s funny , last week I kept hearing that most ppl that have HSV are usually very attractive … sooooo lol 
Haha not to brag but I also consider myself attractive and have always gotten lots of attention from guys n get hit on pretty often n yes I do also feel a dark cloud over me or think to myself … dude only if u knew u probably would change ur mind about me … I hate it !! 

It’s hard work but we gotta work everyday on our confidence n keep reminding ourselves that the right fkn person will see past it … n those r the ppl we need to be fuckin with anyways !! Gotta get this ur either gonna accept everything about me or get the fuck away from me attitude!!!

I used to get attention and always in spotlight before too and I know how it feels like when all is diff and not everyone understands but just try to distract yourself with the positive things. I know it’s hard, we feel so alone sometimes but after we past the process, you’ll feel stronger and find meaning again. Imagine me I’m (F/26) diagnosed a yr now. I still am single and find it hard to trust telling even my close friends but I just tend to survive for the ppl that cares (my family) love isn’t about what you satisfies our desires. Sometimes I feel grateful to have this pain in me coz it taught me a lot and made me realize life more. Sometimes idk if I can meet someone halfway in this life but I just try to distract myself with positivity. Even more hard for us women to find a guy that will understand. Guys will think the worst and it is normal. You’ll be surprised when you past the process and feel whole again.

Second, as someone much older than you, you’re so young and just starting out. There is SO much to life and you are absolutely NOT tainted. Education is empowering so go learn the stats about hsv2 and then get back out there. Practice disclosing and even if the first time is terrible, it gets easier each time. Everyone will ask questions so be prepared. They’ll want to know if you take meds, what’s allowed/off limits if anything and then you’ll be ready to go. The above experience is what a healthy, consensual relationship should sound like anyhow.

tw0wxf,Don't know if your male or female but you may have eczema. You can get vaginal eczema. Itchy and sore.,2022-04-05 11:16:17,1
tw0wxf,Thank you so much for the response I just wanna be responsible you know. Every time I go on Google and look up possible signs and symptoms it always shows the worst case scenario first. I have an appointment with the dermatologist on Wednesday hopefully they can give me a real diagnosis on what’s going on with me.,2022-04-04 13:08:53,1

tw0pxv,"I told all my friends and family (shit even my 95 year-old grandmother about it).

My dad admitted to me that he has it and my mom had it. One of my sports teammates has it. My cousin said she has HPV and it (herpes) is not a big deal and wouldn't be a dealbreaker to her.

All my friends told me after I told them that they really didn't know much about it, and would consider dating someone with it, including several that didn't realize cold sores on the mouth was herpes.",2022-04-04 16:14:40,2

tvuw9k,"I've commented before about my experience with lysine. Did nothing basically for me. Even with higher doses. Only antivirals helped me personally. 

However if you'd like to try more that could potentially help I've read that red marine algae helps (take that too and not noticed any difference before went on antivirals) but they're healthy so why not. Also read that monolaurin supplements help. 

People claim that vitamins B and zinc help 🤷‍♀️. I've personally been taking them before and after getting herpes with more vitamins and minerals and with what I've experienced I highly doubt they helped. 

That's just my personal experience tho. I'd say best to get bloods done and see if you have any deficiencies for vitamins and minerals though as then you'd know what can actually benefit you because for me my blood tests said everything is good soo maybe that's why they didn't help.",2022-04-04 11:07:42,1
tvuw9k,Just Red marine algae and prevents my outbreaks. Google and read the reviews. It has helped a lot of people.,2022-04-04 12:13:06,1

It sucks so bad having an oral outbreak because people see it, but if someone has a problem, then they can suck it because it doesn’t define who you are. 

You got this, girl. Don’t let it take over. Fuck herpes and fuck cold sores and fuck it all. Who cares. You are you and someone will love you for everything you’ve got, insecurities and all.",2022-04-03 22:23:32,7

tvlm4k,"Hey I understand the depression I was depressed for years until I finally decided enough was enough. I have been diagnosed for 10 years and have had  20+ partners since diagnosis. None of them to their knowledge have genital herpes, some had cold sores. I am currently with a guy who is completely HSV negative. He works at a blood lab and took a test just for shits and giggles.  He knows about my herpes I disclosed and he is completely fine with it and accepts the risks. There are plenty of people like this who do not care. Sitting around and waiting for a cure it’s silly you’re rejecting yourself before anyone even has a chance to think about it or reject you or accept you. You are putting limits on yourself before giving anyone else the opportunity to consider anything. People get rejected every day for a plethora of different reasons Sure there are people who ghosted me especially on tinder but as I talked to my friends I realized they got ghosted too and it wasn’t because of herpes it was because dating apps are cesspools in general. Dating nowadays sucks for so many reasons if you want to pin it on herpes go for it but that’s not the only reason. I was diagnosed with ghsv-1 at 19 and I thought my life was over. I didn't tell a soul, cut off friends and everything because I felt so disgusting and gross. But eventually I put myself out there and had a few positive disclosures and I began to realize that I was the one creating the stigma for myself.. The more people I told the less it weighed me down. Think of it logically friends should care because it doesn’t affect them. The only people your herpes affects are the people you are sleeping With. Friends are supposed to be your support system and if you tell them your story they should not judge you And they will learn from you And your experience. Hell you May even help a fellow herpes person out because if someone discloses to your friend after you teach them about herpes they will be more understanding and knowledgeable about it. But that’s up to you. I’ll attach some links that have seemed to help people and if you need anything please dm me.I’ve had it for almost a decade at this point and have a pretty good handle on it.

tvu0yr,really an outdated pill if anything you should b on valtrex for an anti viral,2022-04-04 05:31:18,3
tvu0yr,"Yeah, ask for valtrex. You should feel relief on valtrex in 3 days. And you can take .5-2g. I take 1g daily and 2 during OBs. Most people take .5 daily and 1g during OBs or only .5g during OBs. It just depends on you body. First OB can be hard. Give it 1-3 weeks, and after that, 3days for any other OBs.",2022-04-04 05:45:43,2
tvu0yr,"It's not outdated. Valtrex - valacyclovir - is a prodrug of acyclovir, and turns into acyclovir in your body. 

The dose should be 400 mg orally 3 times/day for 7–10 days.

The issue here is that you had symptoms for 5 days before taking any meds, so it might not do much. The sooner you start meds, the better. Continue to take them, for sure, but your primary would probably suck anyway. 

For pain, either ask your doctor for some lidocaine ointment or get some at any drugstore. Your doctor can give you some that's stronger, but at this point, use what you can get. 

If it hurts to pee, get a squirty water bottle, and squirt water over yourself as you pee. Make sure to drink plenty of water, because the acid in your urine hitting the sores is what hurts. Water will help dilute that. 

This is the worst it's ever going to be, I swear. The first outbreak is the worst. Hang in there. 💖",2022-04-04 06:10:06,1
tvu0yr,"Personally I've tried acyclovir before only when had OB especially during 1st and last but it didn't help. Only did when started taking it regularly. I'm not a medical professional so wouldn't know why but I haven't had an OB after being on them daily. 

For reference before I'd have them constantly every period of mine 🤷‍♀️. 

I've heard some people do a lot better wirh valtrex so yeah maybe ask for that. If they won't prescribe it there are ways of getting it legally online if in America and UK at least.",2022-04-04 11:12:59,1
tvu0yr,From what I’ve read the only benefit of valtrex is that you don’t have to take it as often? My doctor also recommended not starting off taking daily meds but at this point I want to do everything to present it Eve being this bad again,2022-04-04 05:54:27,1
tvu0yr,"Sorry to piggyback off this, but you take 1g of Valtrex daily as a preventative, correct? Just asking because I am still exploring options for preventatives, and was recently prescribed acyclovir as well!",2022-04-04 08:16:23,1
tvu0yr,The CDC updated their guidelines for treatment last summer to: suppress the OBs as much as possible in the first year or two. Ask if you doctor knows that. I ran into inept provider one after the other when I was seeking treatment. Now I’m under the care of an infectious disease doctor and she stays up on the journals. 🙌,2022-04-04 06:25:44,2

tvdjyh,Absolutely. Do know though herpes isn’t just a STI. You can get it from kissing. You can get HSV1 in both area’s. The only way to know is by getting tested. You can know the strain by having the outbreak tested. It’s important to know this.,2022-04-04 01:16:14,1

tvdjyh,On top of that it depends on the type of herpes as well. Cold sores are a type of HSV and can infect there partners as well. I’ve seen children have cold sores. This is uncommon and some people do not know this.,2022-04-04 01:18:19,2
tvdjyh,"Neither one of us has gotten swabbed for Herpes. His symptoms were only little red dots on the head of his penis and itching. I got cold sores in my mouth and extreme vaginal itching. He has had tests in the past but never a herpes one. And I had never had sexual intercourse before so I was not infected before sleeping with him, so I definitely got it from him. One day I noticed the little red dots on his penis head and totally panicked, knowing that it wasn’t normal. I freaked out, asked him what that was, he sent a picture to his uncle who is a doctor, and just visually he said he had herpes. Then our symptoms got worse (his began to itch and I developed the cold sores in mouth and extreme vaginal itching). So he insists he must have had it and never presented symptoms until that day, but I just really need to know if he recently became infected (cheating) and then gave it to me.",2022-04-03 17:34:32,1
tvdjyh,"this is just not true… there are countless people on this sub who got their first ever outbreak after getting vaccinated or some other stressor, when they in fact had the virus for many years.",2022-04-04 13:27:26,2
tvdjyh,"Yes that’s what I’m reasoning. That it can’t be possible for him to have gotten infected two years prior and just now showing symptoms. When I saw his symptoms, I got mine that same day too. So he gave them to me, I’m just not buying the “I probably had herpes since before you two years ago and I am just now showing symptoms.” Specifically because I got my symptoms immediately too.",2022-04-04 06:03:51,0
tvdjyh,"Thank you. Unfortunately, when it happened he convinced me that he must have had herpes before getting into a relationship with me and just then flaring up. This happened in October. The same day that I saw his symptoms, I got mine. At most, the next day. So I think I missed the 100% bloodwork certainty of whether or not he cheated. But it’s just that I got my second outbreak this past week and it was brought up to mind again. I just find it difficult to believe that I was infected that day by him and immediately got symptoms and he is claiming he must have gotten herpes before entering a relationship with me and that that day was his first ever flare up. When I got infected we had been together for one year and ten months approximately. It’s more believable that he cheated on me, got infected days or two weeks later and then infected me. But idk. This is so stressful.",2022-04-04 06:08:29,1
tvdjyh,"Yes, I got both oral and genital herpes.",2022-04-04 05:27:09,1
tvdjyh,Ive been with him for two years. Do you think that’s possible? That he got it two years ago? Also how did you trace it back to the person who gave it to you?,2022-04-04 05:22:40,1
tvdjyh,I think it’s possible but I feel like if your not getting any signs I Atleast 2 weeks you’ll be alright,2022-04-03 18:57:32,1
tvdjyh,"No, I'm sorry I don't have any data points on how common it is.",2022-04-04 12:48:40,1
tvdjyh,Yes it’s genital herpes. Extreme itchiness and redness.,2022-04-04 05:25:43,1
tvdjyh,If you both get blood tests the IGM and IGG are good ways to know if it’s a recent infection or one you’ve had for a while. IGG antibodies take months to develop so if negative/inconclusive with a positive IGM that usually indicates recent infection. High IGG numbers indicate an infection that’s been present for some time (6+ months),2022-04-03 23:12:09,3
tvdjyh,Agreed. He is gaslighting you.,2022-04-04 06:18:30,0
tvdjyh,"Agreed. If you already had it, he wouldn’t have triggered an OB in you. So he is gaslighting you. Go on meds to stop the OBs and then dump him. There are better partners out there.",2022-04-04 06:20:25,2
tvdjyh,"Absolutely! I know people personally who found out via bloodwork and it’s been YEARS and no outbreak. You can get hsv from sharing a drink, touching self after not washing hands, etc.. have you guys had any significant trust issues? Or arw things otherwise healthy?",2022-04-04 05:59:49,2
tvdjyh,I traced it back because we went on a one week break (bf & I). In that time I had surgery and had full blood work up - negative. He slept with his female friend I never trusted and she had it and didn’t disclose. My bf did not have it prior.,2022-04-04 06:01:44,1
tvdjyh,Both types can cause that… HSV 1 and HSV 2.,2022-04-04 05:27:03,2
tvdjyh,[deleted],2022-04-04 00:06:01,1
tvdjyh,"Oh, there’s no doubt in my mind I didn’t have it before. I never had a sexual partner before him. He was my first. So I am 100% he gave it to me. I just wanted to see if there was any way I could prove he cheated or if he really did have it before entering a relationship with me and only showed symptoms one year and 10 months later (this happened in October).",2022-04-04 06:23:13,2
tvdjyh,I thought HSV2 is specifically genital herpes. At least more commonly than HSV1.,2022-04-04 05:30:03,1
tvdjyh,"For any strain of HSV:

Positive IgG value: infection that was acquired more than 3+ months ago. Higher the IgG value = more antibodies you have built up over time. 

IgM is for current (or sometimes recent) infections so if someone tests Neg for IgM and IgG it doesn’t necessarily mean they don’t have HSV, it just means they are too far into the current infection to test positive on IgM but have not built up enough antibodies to test positive on IgG. This is why they say getting a sore swabbed is your best bet for the most accurate conclusion of being HSV+.",2022-04-04 00:12:07,3
tvdjyh,I think you have your answer unfortunately. Trust your gut and your symptoms. Time to go bb.,2022-04-04 06:26:57,1
tvdjyh,"HSV2 is not specifically genital herpes, & HSV1 genitally is becoming more and more common (that's what I have). Both types can occur in both places (oral and genital), though oral HSV2 is uncommon.",2022-04-04 12:50:19,2
tvdjyh,Thank you so much!!!!,2022-04-04 05:26:33,2
tvdjyh,"Yes thank you, I really appreciate it. I actually broke up with him last week. But it’s just one of those things you want concrete evidence for to be reassured that you didn’t make it up and that you were 100% correct you know? I just need that confirmation to feel sane and to just know. To just get true relief of the truth.",2022-04-04 06:29:50,3
tvdjyh,I my self also have genital hsv1. Which was very confusing since the doctors told me I had hsv2 because it was on my genitals. You jus need to research research research. I had to get 3 tests taken to finally get a good doctor who knows what they’re talking about. Granted I live in the middle of nowhere 👁👄👁,2022-04-04 14:02:45,2

tv1bfa,I'm a 30yo male and I was diagnosed about 4 months ago. I have only once been denied because of it and get laid very regularly (slight brag). I have honestly found that most people appreciate the honesty when you tell them. Especially if you have some info for them about it and are casual about it like it's no big deal.,2022-04-04 02:40:10,3

tv1bfa,"May I ask if you have type 1 or 2?  Out of curiosity. 
I'm asking bc of transmission rates. Everyone I talk to mentions they have raw sex all the time which is fab but then they say oh its type 1 which has less than a 1% transmission rate after 2 years 

Trying to get a feel of type 2ers having raw amazing sex without passing it on. I get so worried I can't enjoy myself.",2022-04-03 22:11:53,2

tv1bfa,🥰🥰,2022-04-03 10:19:31,1
tv1bfa,Yes unfortunately it did fall out.. but I think it was because I was on anti virals for TOO long. Suppressive therapy is only supposed to last 6months to a 1 year. I took the anti vitals for much longer than that. Which is why I think my hair started falling out.. also the stress of having herpes probably made my hair fall out too lol it’s down my back now which is the longest it’s Ever been,2022-04-03 23:01:23,1
tv1bfa,"No biggie, rejection happens. Just keep swimming! 🥳",2022-04-04 03:03:25,2
tv1bfa,"I stopped taking valtrex and acyclovir years ago, my hair fell out with both and I was still having outbreaks. The medicine didn’t do anything for me so I just stopped. I still take l-lysine tho and that seems to work fine for me",2022-04-03 21:29:29,4
tv1bfa,"Do you take anti virals? How often are your oral outbreaks? I use medicated blistex and carmex often for cold sores. Also Take l-lysine everyday. Drink a lot of water with it. I disclose to every partner, once I disclose and my partner is cool with everything, we’re pretty open to do whatever. But there are also precautionary measures you can take like using dental dam, doing oral makes sure the guy wears a condom",2022-04-04 02:58:18,2

tv1bfa,"I have type 1. I’ve had it for 4, almost 5 years. I think transmission rates vary. Even though it’s 1% transmission rate, it can still be passed.

tv1bfa,"My usual disclosing statement is

Hey just so you know I have hsv2. It's no biggie but for some people it's a deal breaker. If you have any questions I'm open to fielding them. Lots of people have it and don't disclose but out of honesty I just want you to know!

Something like that. I've found in person to be just as good as over message because you can sort of have a laugh about it and tell a story or two and throw in some info to them. 

I think the key is to be just confident about it. If they aren't keen then nothing you can do. The girls over been with have appreciated the honesty and understand how hard it is to be honest about something easily hidden like herpes. 

I do tend to frolick with quite sexually active and promiscuous people though so maybe they are usually more open and understanding to these sorts of things",2022-04-04 09:15:04,2
tv1bfa,"Just want to chime in and say it’s more prevalent among women due to anatomy, so some of the women you disclose to are likely to have it already anyway (as basically all the women in this sub do).

tv1bfa,What’s your experience?,2022-04-04 03:04:08,1
tv1bfa,"Ohh so you did transmit it to all of them,  even orally. 

That's my fear lol I don't want to give it to them even if they agree to take the risk. It just sucks. One day I'll wrap my head around it but for now sex just sucks lol  every time I have sex I think, I wonder if hes getting it right now. Will it be 3 days till he knows? Maybe 5.  Maybe 2 weeks. 
Its an endless inner thought pattern and obviously not enjoyable for me lol  terrible because I used to love sex so much.  

The diagnoses doesn't bother me for any other reason. Outbreaks are never bad  I never itch  nothing. It's just sex lol  that damn thing haha",2022-04-03 22:43:40,2

tv1bfa,Take the valtrex only when you feel an outbreak comining on. You maintain everyday with the lysine in your system,2022-04-04 14:24:40,1
tv1bfa,"Yea I transmitted it in both regions, from oral sex, kissing etc .. but I inform all my partners. They’re okay with the risk and when they get it, they can only be mad at themselves. If mad at all. 

Don’t beat yourself up about it, they’re consenting adults and they’re fully aware of what they are doing. Herpes is not a big deal, and there is so many content online that is truly fighting the stigma. Have you heard of the herpesgoddess ? Search her on tiktok, she’s great and makes funny TikTok’s about having herpes. She has hsv 2 ! Check her page out and she’s on YouTube as well",2022-04-03 22:59:10,1

Every story gives me confidence. I've just had so many people say this and then they are hsv1 which is so much less transmissable genitally 
So it doesn't help me lol

I'm only 5 months in so I know im more contagious right now but after a year I'd like to throw the condoms off and enjoy my life lol the paranoia just kills me and it really makes sex not enjoyable. 

Its not even the guilt of transmitting it. It's the confrontation. I don't like giving someone a cold lol I reeeeeally don't want to be like oh... well...sorry. here's some lemonbalm and lysine for your irreversible troubles.

While having fibro might make your potential partner more susceptible to contracting the virus, the increased risk of transmission is still not that dramatic, especially if you’re on meds that suppress outbreaks. 

And having HSV as someone with fibro also isn’t the end of the world.

I think, on the whole, a relationship between you and a potential partner with fibromyalgia should look the same as any relationship between someone who is HSV positive and someone who is negative: 

Be careful, be informed, pay attention to your outbreaks and your own health, and be aware of the risks.",2022-04-03 22:49:37,5

tvmkh9,I’m in the same boat waiting for confirmation. Have you had any oral symptoms yet? The best way to confirm is to get swabbed 24-48 hrs of symptoms appearing.,2022-04-03 23:59:47,2
tvmkh9,"I had oral symptoms when I contracted it (blisters in my throat, infected tongue). A few weeks later I got blisters around my anus. The oral symptoms didn't show up again. I sometimes feel a tingling in my lip but that's about it. OBs only in the genital area.",2022-04-04 04:25:17,1
tvmkh9,I have it in both spots! I originally only had genital and then I  had oral symptoms after around a year or so and now I only get oral symptoms. It seems to pick a spot over time and just appear there.,2022-04-04 11:48:01,1
tvmkh9,Yup got both the same instance. Which is why I’m assuming it’s hsv-1. Haven’t had a OB since initial (almost a year). The partner said they used to get coldsores as a kid so I just put two and two together..however both PCR swabs came back negative & wellness centre wouldn’t let me get blood work done without sores later on when I went.,2022-04-04 12:19:27,1
tvmkh9,"he had no visible oral or genital symptoms, and unknowingly passed it to me. my ghsv1 symptoms were pretty much within 2 weeks after my sexual contact with him (he gave me oral sex). i’ve had no oral sores since exposure, but on two isolated occasions on my chin what i thought was a bug bite or acne kind of started to appear, then disappeared within the hour. since then i suspected maybe i have it orally too. this is one of the most frustrating viruses. you have to wait for it to rear it’s ugly head to know where you have it.

i was curious why folks are getting it on their genitals but not reporting any cold sores on their mouth, assuming kissing was involved?",2022-04-04 00:18:15,1

tvmkh9,"i agree with your doubts too, i heard the same thing, but i err on the side of caution and just assume +orally even though its not confirmed. 

i’m taking this one day at a time. i can’t be bogged down with disclosure rehearsals and dating in this post-diagnosis era for me. too stressful since its only been 3 months…. focusing on your mental and physical health, healing, and being merciful toward yourself should be the priorities. i know sex and pleasure are important, but there is far more higher than that.

i’m a pharmacist- i’m staying positive about the research and development outlook that the pharma industry is working on. it won’t happen anytime soon, but thanks to covid, there is immense interest from these companies looking at antiviral technology, vaccines, treatments for other viruses. if they found it for chickenpox and shingles, they’ll find it for hsv too. there are currently a few companies that already are in preclinical studies with it now. 🙏🏼",2022-04-04 01:54:00,3

tvnooe,"Thank you for your responses.

I went ahead and had a full STD test done the week before last because I was having some funky symptoms and I started reading about STDs and STIs on the internet, freaking myself out. I was thoroughly convinced that I caught syphilis, but type 2 herpes didn't even cross my mind.

My gynecologist took a urine sample and found that I did have a UTI which explained the weird symptoms I was having. She even examined the bumps on my vaginal area and said that they are most likely pimples from using a dirty razor. Also, after explaining my sexual history to her (I have had oral sex with 3 people,) no alarms were set off. 

My doctor even told me ""I don't think we'll need to do a blood test."" 

But I was adamant about doing a full STD screening because I thought I had syphilis.

The results came back and I did not have syphilis, but my test result did say ""HSV-1 negative"" ""HSV-2 positive"" but there was no index value in sight.

If it also helps, my STD/STI screening is from Mayo Clinic. 

I talked to my current boyfriend and he has only had 1 sexual partner before me, and his previous sexual partner had never had a sexual partner before him as well.

So I would have had to have been infected before I even met him, which would have been about a year ago or even longer than that. That is, if I am infected at all.",2022-04-04 01:54:56,2

tvn9cl,"I had a similar experience but again could be two separate things. I was super swollen from itching and it everything just burned because I had cuts which could have been from itching but now with research could be a sore. I also put lotion but after sex when it was burning and I felt maybe I was just dry from friction.  And so I thought from that day on I fucked up by putting lotion on my vagina. And soap during showers.

I had itching near my Perineum which created dryness and then eventually I would get painful cuts. The bumps that I did have were skin colored and looked like razor bumps. Never scabbed. Then I started getting itchiness on the pubic area, labia majora. I couldn’t see bumps but it was just red and swollen and itchy like a rash. If I scratch too hard I’ll bleed and then I’ll get tiny scabs.

As for feeling sick, I had a sore throat and headaches. Everything seemed pretty normal considering it’s spring time and I normally feel a little I’ll during this time. But I also had leg numbness which kind of sold me on it being herpes. I had numbness in my calf and it was so weird. And then fast forward I’m having nerve pain like shooting pains in my leg. They have been getting better. I’ve been taking medication for a week so maybe it’s because my outbreak is healing now. 

All of my symptoms had a reasonable explanation. Allergies, smoking, shaving, putting lotion on vagina after sex, pain after sex while trying diff lube….i didn’t even consider something was actually happening until the 2 week mark with itchiness. I totally should have gone in sooner but I thought it was normal to have irritation after having sex with a shaved vulva and a hair-er man.

My discharge was normal. And I had burning only when pee touched sores not my actual urethra burning. 

With that being said though, everyone has a different experience. My symptoms didn’t really convince me to get checked because everything seemed normal for what I was doing. But some people have very clear signs with sores looking like clusters and scabbing. And the symptoms are similar to a yeast infection and other bacterial infections. So there is always that possibility. 

Waiting and overthinking is very hard. I cried while I got my blood tested because I already accepted it. I was told the person was tested and I also went to get tested to be responsible adults. I asked to get tested for hsv and doctor said unnecessary if I don’t have history of cold sores or sores in genitals. Fast forward a few weeks after having sex with this person… I start getting itchy and burning pain. It is my fault for not asking if they had cold sores or using protection. I saw they had a scab near their chin and I thought oh that’s normal for men that shave… and never thought it could be herpes especially after they were adamant on being negative for everything. I’m having a hard time believing they were being honest with me and it’s super hurtful to think this way. And it’s tearing me apart. And hopefully I can get over the mental part

I’m so sorry you are going through this regardless of the results. It sucks having to be uncomfortable and not knowing why and not having things to make it better.",2022-04-04 02:50:22,2
tvn9cl,"I personally have anxiety now about people not telling me the truth or that they don’t know they have something. Which I guess is something you should always be cautious of in general. But also if you are scared about having it or your partner possibly having it, I don’t think it’s a bad idea to have them test too. especially if that would ease your anxiety. And I guess it says something about the person if they aren’t willing to. At least in my situation. But that’s also my opinion and thoughts on that part. And do you know if your partner also tested for hsv? It’s not included in the regular testing panel. 

And sounds like you could have a UTI based on the burning when you pee. I don’t know if getting sores inside your urethra is possible. Im new to this so im not sure. I’ve read it’s possible to have it in vagina or cervix. My friend had a uti recently and felt ill. Frequent urination and pain. Again different for everyone. 

And I hope each day that you wait gets a little easier ❤️",2022-04-04 04:11:00,2
tvn9cl,"Thank you for your well typed response and for taking the time to reply to me. 

I have some similar symptoms to your experience. But when I get the burning during peeing I can feel it’s because of the sores but also I can feel it’s my actual urethra. Idk if that means I have sores inside or if it’s because of the UTI. 

I’ve been with my boyfriend since December and we’ve only had actual sex like 4? Times. He mostly likes to eat me out instead of PIV sex. He got tested before we got together though and he was clean. I havent noticed any sores anywhere on him either although he could just not be showing symptoms. He still refuses to get tested though like hes convinced that I just had a terrible reaction to the lotion. But I used CeraVe and apparently that lotion makes peoples faces burn…I can’t imagine how they’d feel if they put it on their vag like I did 🤦🏼‍♀️

I don’t have any sore throat, leg numbness, shooting pains, etc. the headache could be at like a 2 pain wise but it lasts for like 5 minutes. It’s just the burning and the antivirals are making me feel kinda sick now. 

I definitely cried a lot today because I never thought that I actually could have herpes and the waiting until the test comes back is the absolute worst. I’m just making myself crazy googling and inspecting myself and worrying. My boyfriend keeps telling me that I don’t have it and that I shouldn’t worry about it. I’m sorry you have to go through this too 💙 I’m glad your outbreak is clearing up though, that’s always a relief.",2022-04-04 03:28:50,1
tvn9cl,"Omg I’m so scared now. I thought I was healing and almost done but I started bleeding a bit earlier. I washed off the blood and now I see obvious little white blisters (like you’d get on your lip) all over the inside of my labia majora lips. The bumps have died down a lot but I have the tiny blisters now. And I had some nerve pain in my butt and legs today. There’s tons of them. They’re like white with a red outline on some. And I have bloody discharge a bit, it’s like I started my period. I don’t know what to do, I’m afraid this is going to get 10x more painful than it is now

I started Valacyclovir on Sunday, I thought I’d start to get better by now",2022-04-04 22:29:51,1
tvn9cl,"Me too. Some people just don’t know they have it but the people who do know and just choose not to disclose it give me lots of anxiety. Like I feel like I need to disclose this information to any future partners because I’d feel like a terrible person if I didn’t say anything. Especially if my being with them became a regular thing and I’d have to admit I lied to them in the future. I could have contracted it years ago and all this time I just never knew I had the virus. 

I did tell him right after the doctor that he needs to get tested but all he says is “you don’t have it. You’re fine.” He doesn’t get that he could have it (from me or from his prostitute roommate who woke him up by riding him) even if he doesn’t have symptoms. I guess ignorance is bliss but the fact that he was sleeping with me means he should have gotten tested for my sake at least. Not to say that I’m not to blame for not insisting on condoms. He told me he was tested for herpes and some other STDs and he came back clean in October (I don’t know if I trust him, he originally said he got a medical test done). 

I’m not sure, it is probably a UTI. Makes me wonder what I’ve had in the past because what I thought was a UTI didn’t feel painful at urination like it does now. 

But I’m hoping the OB is clearing up? I’m on day 2 of the antivirals and while I’m still dry and I’m pain, the sores feel hard like scabs. They seem to be mostly on the lips lowest and closer to the vaginal opening/anus rather than all over the lips. They look red and scabby too and I read that means they’re scabbing over. Maybe today and tomorrow will heal them more because I’ve started the antivirals? I just want to be able to walk around by Wednesday because I have to go back to work then. I’ve just been staying in bed with a wet towel between my legs occasionally which helps.",2022-04-04 18:51:25,2
tvn9cl,"Oh my goodness!! I’m so so sorry!! This sounds like a first outbreak. As most people say the first outbreak is the worst and lasts long. I’m approximately 25-30 days in but I believe by the two week mark everything was less uncomfortable for me. Which then I went in and was prescribed antivirals. So I was late on doing that meaning it probably would not have been lasting this long for me. Still itchy but no sores except for two cuts that appeared the other day. But healed fast. 

It is possible you might have a yeast infection,BV, or UTI along with hsv outbreak. I’ve read about people on here who have had it like this which made it confusing for them not knowing why the UTI or yeast infection medication wasn’t healing all the symptoms. 

Might be best to update your doctor. Not sure if you need to take something different or up the amount. I’m also not sure how quick they work for the first outbreak either.

Hopefully your job is understanding of your situation. Because there is no way someone can go in like that! At least for me the flu symptoms like chills and fatigue started when my itchiness was going down. And it is very tough to pay attention in class and get work done when I’m mentally and physically drained from all of this. 

But I feel you! I hear you! This whole month it’s like I’ve been on a rollercoaster. I’m scared to get another outbreak, im scared of what my friends really think of me… it’s just a really big change.",2022-04-05 03:57:02,2
tvn9cl,"You are completely correct. Ignorance is bliss. I swear the person I’m with isn’t getting tested because he knows the truth and would rather not have proof that he needs to disclose. Which is so so fucked up. But his actions speak loud and I’m glad I can see that they are being neglectful for other reasons.  and now I don’t have to waste my time anymore. Just sucks that I got it from someone who isn’t important to me. :/ but it was also my neglect so I can’t put so much hate towards a person and I just need to learn to forgive. 

And I can’t remember if I mentioned but I was prescribed acyclovir for a week. 3 times a day. My symptoms of itching were going down by the time I was taking it but still uncomfortably itchy. And I noticed I’ve been getting cuts on the 4th and 5th day. So I’m just hoping I’m not getting another outbreak 😭 but I also heard that some antiviral brands don’t work for some people. Maybe just my body getting used to them",2022-04-05 03:40:19,1
tvn9cl,"Ahhh yeah I think that is what it is. But I talked to a lovely doctor and he made me feel a bit better because the blisters are flat so he thinks they’ve already popped. All the blood is probably from blisters inside draining, hence the spontaneous period. I woke up and my pad was soaked though, not sure how normal that is. I don’t hurt as much though and I didn’t have to sit in the bathtub to pee today. 

Oh no! 25-30 days sounds so difficult to go through. I’m glad you healed fast and you’re out of the worst part though❤️ 

Ah that would be my luck to get another infection along with this. I don’t think I have but I can call my doctor to see what they say. There’s no way I’m telling my boss what it actually is if I can help it. I just told her I had a terrible reaction to some lotion and can’t move around. I’m supposed to go back tomorrow. But I only work until Thursday and I can move around now. It should be okay. I definitely feel you on the mentally draining bit. All this is so exhausting I don’t see the point of much now. 

This is a huge change and I’m sorry you have to go through it. HSV is so stigmatised and emotionally draining and it makes me not want to tell anyone out of shame. It’s so hard wondering when another breakout will happen. And I hate this, I don’t even want my boyfriend to touch me or for my parents to find out (I’m 24 but close to them).

Why are you ashamed? Several people disclosed to me before I got it and I never thought ""oof, they must be a mess of a person who goes around raw-dogging."" Anyone that would think that doesn't remember the two big things about herpes, that it can evade a condom and spread completely without showing symptoms. And heck, 99% of people have yolo'd and had unprotected sex. It doesn't make you a bad person. It's unfortunate that you may form a superficial attachment to someone and then find out that they're ignorant and/or unreasonably prejudiced, but at that point your status has served you well as a filter and you move on to the next one. My advice on dating, and it's certainly not the only strategy, is to throw your status out there relatively early on before you build up any big ideas about a person and waste time, since dating is going to be a bit more of a numbers game for us than it otherwise would have been.

Dating nowadays sucks for so many reasons if you want to pin it on herpes go for it but that’s not the only reason. I was diagnosed with ghsv-1 at 19 and I thought my life was over. I didn't tell a soul, cut off friends and everything because I felt so disgusting and gross. But eventually I put myself out there and had a few positive disclosures and I began to realize that I was the one creating the stigma for myself.. The more people I told the less it weighed me down. Think of it logically friends should care because it doesn’t affect them. The only people your herpes affects are the people you are sleeping With. Friends are supposed to be your support system and if you tell them your story they should not judge you And they will learn from you And your experience. Hell you May even help a fellow herpes person out because if someone discloses to your friend after you teach them about herpes they will be more understanding and knowledgeable about it. But that’s up to you. I’ll attach some links that have seemed to help people and if you need anything please dm me.I’ve had it for almost a decade at this point and have a pretty good handle on it.

This first link is info about a support group I’m in. All herpes people from all over the world we all share are experiences, vent , swap info and remedies, and just talk about life. It's an awesome place to be for sure. There is a whole chat for ladies to ask questions and a disclosing chat for advice on how to do that. 

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rc7tArwGwDQVIPkgBdA_oAW6z3Wm9Iucx-b3hu8Fsec/edit

This is a disclosure guide with “scripts” on how to tell potential partners about herpes and what had worked for us. Mine is under Lauren. Also at the bottom it has resources about herpes to Send to partners.

https://docs.google.com/file/d/1vExi_t8aY_LzaIe7PB3DihQLW3QqJiW6/edit?usp=docslist_api&filetype=msword

This is a list of common myths about herpes and why they are wrong with cited sources. Maybe this can not only ease your mind but if a partner has questions you will have answers backed by science.

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-6oZmnfywTFNYScKYC7Mh7MXZKrA0GUcztS8Bz5bW0k/edit

This is a list of social Medias about herpes. Sometimes it does people good to see people being public about it and the amount of support they receive from strangers. There are also alot of disclosure advice there as well. The accounts are funny and informative and all herpes positive. There is everything on there from podcasts, YouTube, TikToks, blogs, Facebook support groups, Instagram pages, dating pages, subreddits, and websites.

That way they can monitor her during her pregnancy and prescribe antivirals in the last term before birth. 

As for your marriage, don’t make an issue where there isn’t one. She has excepted the out come of your infidelity and made the choice to stay.

tv1mk9,"It’s two things:

Fetish.  And mental illness. 

First and foremost these guys are dangerous and screwed in the head.

Secondly, the fact that you have herpes, to them, means that you are very sexual and horny and have had so much sex that you ended up getting an STD. And sexual women are a turnon to men. That’s how their brain twists it.

Avoid any guy that comes anywhere close to saying something like this.",2022-04-03 06:35:01,21

tv1mk9,"Yes! I’ve run into hsv- guys that were turned on by me having it. I’m realizing I’m actually very into this on both sides of the coin. I have herpes & my outbreaks turn me on like crazy which in turn makes me want to find someone that wants me when I’m like that. It’s a part of the bug hunting fetish. 

I have a met a great guy here on Reddit that’s so into it. He does not have herpes or any other stds. He’s also really into everything else I like which is even better. Unfortunately he lives pretty far away & we’ve yet to meet in person but we talk daily & plan to meet. He’s become a pretty good friend of mine. 

I understand why someone liking your herpes might creep you out but people like what they like. As long as they are educated & both parties are aware of what could happen & are ok with it there’s no trouble. If you’re not ok with it that’s ok too.",2022-04-03 15:07:03,5

tv1mk9,"Having HSV also makes us more susceptible to HIV & HEP because if we are having an OB, that’s direct into the bloodstream. Even without an OB sex causes microscopic tears that could easily allow infection. If you continue to practice unsafe sex, I’d recommend getting an rx for Prep & regular tests for Hep C. There is no vax for Hep C.

tv1mk9,The first part is not entirely true. The few internet definitions define a bug hunter as someone that specifically seeks out acquiring HIV. This is incorrect. Bug hunters vary in their desires. Some are interested in specific stds or other shared circumstances. Doesn’t even have to be an std at all. They could want your cold or your flu if you have it. Also worth mentioning not all of them want what EVERYBODY has. Some of them set their sights on the one person they’re interested in & only want what that person has. Then if they came into contact with someone else that has the same stuff they may have no interest at all. It’s a weird fetish but these people are out there.,2022-04-04 04:17:07,2

tv1mk9,Agreed that’s why I’ve just become celibate since herpes essentially and if I meet a guy I have feelings for and somehow is ok with me having herpes we can take it from there but it’s not worth the risk. So many people are deceitful about their sex life for some reason,2022-04-04 05:01:43,2
tv1mk9,"Wow, I’m sorry to hear that. I pray your results come back negative 🙏🏾 yes, HIV is a huge risk. I do love raw sex, but the men I sleep with are men I’ve known for a while. But, you can never be too careful that’s for sure.",2022-04-04 13:40:25,2

In QAF, they had an epi where there was a bug chasing party. One of the few times Brian actually behaved ethically and morally. 

Bug chasing isn’t new (like you said, older gays). But before there was a chicken pox vaccine, when a kid got it, they’d have sleep overs to expose other kids. How many of them are now experiencing shingles? Same thing with COVID. Both diseases can have long term ramifications. I can’t imagine seeking out this disease.

tuzvds,"Your life is not ""ruined"".

Be careful with the language you use. You still have a car, right - you were driving home from class. You are still in school. You have money to pay for the ever-expensive gas. You were driving home, so you still have a home, and presumably food, and clothing, and you are still going out on dates. 

You use a lot of ""all or nothing"" language - your life is ""ruined"", dude is the ""only"" normal one on PS - how can you possibly know that? Have you met them all? You don't have ""any options"". Really? Tinder? Lots of people put herpes in their profiles and get dates, or tell later. You can meet someone organically - possibilities are endless. 😊

I've had ghsv2 for many, many years. My life did not end. I have friends with ghsv2 who've gone on to have kids (I don't, but couldn't and knew that before I got herpes). We've had relationships and marriages and divorces - it's all very ""normal"". 

Herpes is never, ever a reason to stay in a bad relationship. You think you are lonely now. The loneliest you will ever feel is in a bad relationship. Good for you for leaving the abusive relationship - that takes strength and courage. Don't discount that. 

Make sure to not confuse sadness over herpes with actual depression. If you need counseling, reach out for it. Maybe your school has a counseling center? 

You're going to be okay, I promise.",2022-04-03 06:06:40,5

Discordant couple here! I am a HSV2(-) male and my girlfriend is HSV2(+). 

There is hope! Knowledge is power. Read the literature and data on transmission of HSV-2. 

From a positive female to a negative male, it is around 4% annually for transmission having sex 2x’s a week. 

That is with no form of protection or antivirals. With antivirals, it drops to about 2% and with condoms, it is about 1% or lower.

tuzvds,"First, Sorry your last relationship didn't work out.

Secondly,

Don't let herpes defines you. Don't let your relationship status define you. Focus on you, your life, your hobbies, your passions, etc... 

I fell in love with my ex-wife ( who is GHSV2+ and disclosed it) because of who she was as a person. Because of the great moments we shared outside the bedroom. At 5hrs of sexy times a week, 97% of the time you spend with your SO is outside the bedroom ( unless you live in a single bedroom appt, lol).

True relationships don't break because of Herpes, Mean and uncommunicative people will use it as a poor but easy excuse.  Or it wasn't really a relationship to begin with. Just remember this. Herpes is not on your mind when True Love is in the air!

You are in school, This is awesome ! I hope you are enjoying learning new things.

Become YOU!  You know, the person that attracts minds alike. The person that others don't hesitate to be around you. 

I hate PS with passion. One, because it is just another scam of a OLD. But also because it puts us in a mindset that we are different than others ? We are not. We are all humans ! Dont ever forget that.",2022-04-03 12:19:12,2
tuzvds,"Know that this isn't your fault. You didn't ruin your life. You didn't even get to make a choice in this. That is on the person who decided to be irresponsible and take that choice away from you.

We are only responsible for ourselves and yes even though this is our faults, we are going to have to clean this shit up.

This is not a moral failing. This is just part of the human experience. 

There are days where I fall into an anxiety loop where my irrational fear of being treated less than human by others for something I can't change or have control over. But then, I have lots of friends who support through my mental health struggles.

I also like your outlook. I like that you’re real about it. And you’re right. At some point you’re going to get to a place where you just are happy in yourself. 

You’ll realize you’re not dying. You don’t have cancer. In and of yourself, you’re perfectly happy, and healthy. And you become thankful for that. This can change you in a lot of very deep and very good ways. If you let it.

I reconnected with my faith. Poured myself into my relationship with God. Still pursuing that. And I’m going to find fulfillment in all the other things in life. One of the other things that finally hits you, is that it’s just sex. Sex doesn’t define you. It’s a 20 minute session, on 1 day of your life.

I avoid my eyes like crazy. I had a coworker who came in one day with an extremely red eye. He’s a jokester so I asked if his wife punched him in the eye. He told me it was ocular herpes. I thought maybe pink eye. Thankfully I don’t have to worry about it at night because I wear a sleep mask. 

The first time it happened, I thought I’d been bitten by a spider. It happened to be the same day my niece had false labor. I tried to pop the bumps, nothing came out then I developed red streaks up my arm. I went to the doctor & he said it was Whitlow. 

I usually leave it open to air unless I’m out in public so I don’t worry about door knobs. Then I put a bandaid with acyclovir cream on it. Could be how I got it, someone else touched a surface. But the virus is fragile so it’s not supposed to live long on hard surfaces or when exposed to air.

The initial whitlow showed up 2 weeks later after my ghsv1. The pain and swelling from whitlow lasted for 5 months straight. Acyclovir helped very little but one day it just cleared up and it’s been gone ever since. I’ve been clear from it 8 months now. I was so scared once because I began to feel pain around my face once and couldn’t stop crying thinking I spread it to my face and eyes turns out to be just dry skin. I ordered cloth finger gloves from Amazon to put over it at night so it could “breathe” and dry out. And wore a bandage over it during the day at work.

tux7wy,">”Everyone else gets a free pass because they listened to their doctor.  But because I got tested and came on this Reddit my life is over.”

Believe me.  The feeling is mutual.  I was literally just outside walking my dog thinking how Reddit has colored my perception of everything on this topic, even to the point that it doesn’t agree with my doctors advice.  

>”disclose and have the information spread to my social circle”

Exactly.   Yet another factor nobody on here seems to think about or care.  

The SECOND you tell someone, it spreads like wildfire.  You would always have to date somebody who doesn’t have any mutual friends.  Or even access to your social media list, for fear they may get vindictive. 

Even picture a committed relationship where the girl has a family. Brothers. Sisters. Close friends. The second you tell her, you think it’s not going to get mentioned to her support network? 

It’s a huge issue. She’s going to need someone to talk to. Your privacy is fucked.  As is your reputation. 

This is why it is my solid opinion that if you listen to the science, use condoms, and take antivirals, you reduce the risk of transmission to one percent. One percent is basically not at all.  Let’s discuss the need for disclosure in the context of 1% ….

Edit:  Also, don’t kill yourself.  We’re all sitting here on our couches deciding how to proceed too.  You’re not alone in this.",2022-04-03 00:58:51,11

Herpes is not included for a reason. You do not need to talk about herpes.  You do not need to disclose it. Everyone . EVERYONE has been exposed to hsv 1 and or 2. 
 If you don't have outbreaks you should never have tested and you likely went against medical advice bc you listened to the insane herpes disclosure police on this site or somewhere else online. If you have outbreaks treat them as you would acne, eczema,  poison ivy...treat them and move on.

tux7wy,"I know passing ORAL hsv1 to someone's genitals isn't rare at all, in fact it's now the leading cause of new genital outbreaks . But I thought you said she passed it from her vagina....so that would be ghsv1 to ghsv1 which is rare",2022-04-03 16:36:39,1

tv5ynm,"Maybe you should read Terri Warrens Herpes Handbook .She’s the expert on hsv. And pretty sure sharing drinks etc is not what she says. Including the saliva being risk. As it’s a skin to skin transmission , saliva may have some viral load but you need a minimum to transmit and saliva wouldn’t normally have it. 

Never read that you can’t transmit ghsv1 to partners genitals , just that it is low risk due to ghsv1 shedding less .  

Not blk & white but best not to spread misinformation , don’t you think. ?",2022-04-03 17:37:53,0

tuhgdw,You seem really wonderful - but the one thing I would point out is your comment saying you told her to be careful/it was a dumbass thing to do… the thing with herpes is there’s no guaranteed safe way to not get it. Condoms protect you from dangerous STDs but herpes is a skin to skin contact condition. It can spread even when no sore is present. So it wasn’t her being dumb. Or even the person who gave it to her being dumb. Unless she knows he actively had a sore and had sex with him with an active sore. But otherwise she wasn’t being dumb or careless. It’s a very common and misunderstood condition.,2022-04-02 13:42:17,2
tuhgdw,He got laid ?? I love his confidence. And like there would’ve been soo many other people who would have herpes but not the confidence to say it. That’s actually insane,2022-04-02 13:14:27,2

tuhgdw,"thats fair. it was more of like me venting my frustrations. the guy kinda disclosed. he wasnt taking his meds everyday. annnnd someone warned her about him prior. my point with saying all that was that she shouldve never hooked up with him in the first place, and besides even that, if she wouldve told him to wear a condom, at least we know that she TRIED to protect herself. i understand that herpes transmission is a motherfucker to avoid due to the things you stated, but taking the measures to at least try and keep herself safe goes a long way. its like not wearing a condom during sex and getting someone pregnant versus wearing the condom and still getting someone pregnant. you did everything you could that was in your control to prevent it. bt i do understand your feedback and i appreciate it. and honestly, i asked her how she would react if i got herpes and was telling her and her response was ""i'd tell you youre a fucking idiot"" verbatim. and after hearing her say that, and me already kind of thinking that, i said it to her. it was something that i needed to do in order to not hold a resentment and get to what we need to do moving forward, you know? if i wouldve held that back, the resentment probably wouldve showed itself in a ruder/nastier way down the line. i hope you understand where im coming from.

but the person who gave it to her was definitely a dumbass. he wasnt taking his meds everyday. he would take them on and off, and usually only if he had break outs. bt he didnt tell her that until way after the fact.",2022-04-02 13:58:52,1
tuhgdw,"dude i know!!! and yes he got laid. it was his first time meeting that girl and yea. he did his thing. i was like yre nuts and he was like ""im in a room full of drug addicts, i know i wasnt the only one. i didnt even think about it i just stood up, bt i was embarrased once i saw that no one else stood up"" and i guess afterwards the lady leading the game walked up to him and said ""i appreciate you doing that. i know half this room has it and their too pussy to own.""",2022-04-02 13:20:50,3
tuhgdw,"Yeah I understand that. And I think from both sides, neither you were very informed about herpes at the time that conversation took place… I’m hoping she was tested for a standard STD panel too if she had sex with him without a condom? Having sex without a condom outside of a long term relationship with a trusted partner is definitely being a dumbass, but not because of herpes. Herpes is the least of her concerns.

Edit: meds are helpful in reducing transmission but in my experience MDs only recommend them daily if you have frequent outbreaks - like my MD gave me the option but said it’s not necessary. I didn’t use them at all while I was in a committed relationship. I’d still have sex with someone with hsv2 who didn’t take meds (I have ghsv1).",2022-04-02 14:04:57,1

tuhgdw,"she did get a full panel and she was clean for everything else. and we were broken up. granted she broke up with me and if i gave you context, you would understand why it needed to happen on her end, but im not tryna sit here and type all of that out. bt yea youre preaching to the choir buddy. especially if someone halfassedly discloses that they have herpes. ahhh its frustrating, but whatever. its not like i wasnt out there fucking random ppl. she just got unlucky. the universe punishing her for leaving me in the first place lol.",2022-04-02 14:18:23,2
tuhgdw,"no she did not have it. the key to getting women is confidence dude. and that means owning every part of who you are and not giving a fuck (even if you secretly do, youve got to wear that confidence mask) that same thing applies to stds. if youre a confident person, attractive or unattractive is irrelevant like 70 percent of the time. and if youre actually on point with managing your hsv and you use that same confidence when letting sexual partners know, chances are youll do a lot better with securing sexual partners. obviously there are people who std/sti's are a dealbreaker for no matter what. but if youre not confident about your diagnosis and can back it up with managing your hsv properly, how the hell can you expect a new sex partner to feel assured that theyre safe and wont contract it by sleeping with you. you know?",2022-04-02 13:29:47,2
tuhgdw,"THIS.

If you don't come across as comfortable with your diagnosis, how will anyone else feel comfortable with it?

tv2o6i,"Has your daughter seen a doctor? That's not herpes. Might be hives - tough to tell from a pic. Have they lasted a month, or has it appeared twice? She should see a doc, though. 

Unless you are having inappropriate sexual contact with your child, you won't transmit it to them. Herpes requires direct, unclothed, skin to skin contact to transmit - think oral, vaginal or anal sex. 

The skin on her back is too thick for the virus to penetrate, so even if you went to the bathroom and forgot to wash your hands or something, and then touched her, it wouldn't spread.

It doesn't spread by sharing bathrooms, bathtubs, beds, etc. If it did, imagine how many little kids would get it. It just doesn't happen. If you touch a sore, wash your hands, but try not to touch a sore. You can introduce bacteria from your hands into the sore, or you can then touch your eyes and transmit it to your eyes. Once you have antibodies, that is far less likely to happen, but get in the habit of not touching sores.",2022-04-03 07:15:00,1

Every single source you find will tell you herpes is only spread via direct skin to skin contact with the affected area. Basically you have to touch his genitals or asshole with your genitals or asshole",2022-04-03 09:28:28,5
tv1umy,"I'm not sure where you're researching, because there is loads of stuff that says genital herpes is only contagious by having actual sexual activity with the person who has it. 

Herpes is only infectious from the location of the infection. If he has genital herpes, he is only contagious from his genitals. He is not contagious from his mouth. 

You will not get it from sharing drinks, eating utensils, sharing food, toilet seats, etc. (Please don't share drinks or eating utensils - that's at great way to get covid, colds, norovirus, strep, etc.) 

Educate yourselves.

>3- I read almost all questions on the forum and I was optimistic about your opinion of how it is not as easy as we think the virus is transmittable, you insisted that it does not transmit through objects like straws, tweezers, cups or spoons in the lack of active sores. Does that make me with this event far from contracting it?  
Correct  
5- When people smoke and exhale around other people’s faces, does that transmit herpes?  
No  
>  
>6- when people talk and spit while speaking my and you can see it coming toward the face. Is that a risk? Some people do have a lot of droplets  
No, it takes way more contacts than that

Unless you are sexually intimate with your friend, he's not a risk to you. Just be supportive. Don't tell anyone else - that's his business. 

Also, there's a good chance some of you have oral hsv1 and don't even know it. 67% of people under 50 globally have it and most never get symptoms. A lot of your parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles probably do. It's very common.",2022-04-03 06:51:03,2

I’m not the most knowledgeable about blood tests, so maybe someone else can chime in.. But I don’t know how reliable they are in determining how long you’ve had the virus, if it is positive?

tuw4du,"Yes, correct! I was talking about whether it’s able to tell you how long ago your body was exposed to the virus (I’ve seen people on here talk about it before). Most of the population has oral HSV1 & most people are asymptomatic (they aren’t aware they have it at all). So I was just spitballing basically that if it comes back positive for HSV1, but the numbers show that you’ve most likely had the virus for longer than the time you were with this partner, it wouldn’t be unlikely that you already have it orally (the majority of people with HSV1 have it orally) & are one of the many people who never show symptoms. You wouldn’t know whether it’s oral or genital per say, it would just be more likely that you were infected orally at an earlier point in life (which would then mean you wouldn’t ever develop a genital outbreak).",2022-04-03 05:19:34,1

tv0lua,"In my opinion, it really doesn’t seem to be a herpes sore, but you’ll know soon enough. You may want to question the nurse about the type though. If you already have oral hsv1, then it’s almost impossible for you to also get genital hsv1 too (you can still get genital hsv2 though) — herpes is a virus, so as soon as it enters your body, your body starts making antibodies against it. So, although it ~can~ happen, it’s very rare to have the same type in two different areas of the body because your body has antibodies preventing from reinfection, if that makes sense. 

Also, although I completely agree that herpes in general shouldn’t be anything to worry about, it is still something that deserves your attention if you have it, just because you need to care for your body. If it does end up being herpes, then you can cross that bridge when you come to it.",2022-04-03 04:45:59,1

But I’ve heard of people continuing to experience symptoms despite negative blood test igg and I also read somewhere of someone who continued to test negative until like 10 months so just wondering … has anyone ended up actually being positive on WB after negative IGG.

When I had my initial symptoms though it was all in the vaginal area I had the burning itching tingling redness nerve pain the whole shebang but didn’t notice any like blisters or anything like that. But it’s been 6 months now and I still have on going nerve pain and tingling that only started around that time. So now I’m looking into it I should get the WB to make sure but I haven’t read anywhere about anyones experience testing negative on an Igg but then actually being positive when they took the western blot so I’m curious if it’s happened to anyone. Or if anyone tested negative from 3-6 months but ended up testing positive later on,2022-04-03 05:11:13,1

tufm8f,"Glad to help. 

The more I read it, the worse it gets lol. Presumably, you're both legal to drink, so you're both over 21, if you're in the US, 18 (I think) in Canada, etc. - so you're adults. 

She wanted to have unprotected sex with you, continued to persist in that despite you saying no a number of times - which if the genders were reversed, we'd be all screaming like mad about. She came out of the bathroom in her underwear, jumped on you, and when you tell her you have herpes, she said, ""ewwww"" like she is a 4 year old who has to eat the broccoli. 

THEN, after you left, she called you nasty names after because of how you acted? And she rewrites history? 

Dude, count your blessings. This could have been 6 months or a year later and be over her cheating or a fight about money or whatever. At the very least, she doesn't handle alcohol well. At the worst - and probably more realistic - she doesn't handle relationships well.

tuw78q,"I haven’t experienced anything too too bad with shaving but if you haven’t shaved in nearly 5 months then you likely are just not used to it anymore and your skin must be more sensitive now.

You could also try waxing, some women have luck with that method over shaving",2022-04-03 04:00:42,3

tu0px4,"Well he clearly isn't very bright - doubling up on condoms is about as stupid as not wearing a condom at all, it causes them to split. 

I will say however, that in my experience its really best to disclose these things before things get heated. Before you are in the room about to have sex. For exactly the reason you stated. People freak out but are still obviously... excited... make decisions that perhaps they wouldn't have, had they been given a bit of decompression time. Then freak out post sex.

I think he's clearly uneducated about cold sores (I've been in this situation with an ex gf who didn't know cold sores are herpes). Likely he doesn't want to have to deal with this new info, and when you think about it, it IS a lot to take in the time frame you've given here - hes finding out you have herpes, processing that then being told he has herpes ans processing that too. This is not a failure on your part by the way, I'm just trying to keep things in perspective.",2022-04-01 22:03:04,1
tu0px4,I would talk to him about it more?? He still has sex with you. He sounds really naive and maybe inexperienced if he put 2 condoms on since that makes it more dangerous since they could break that way.,2022-04-02 01:01:28,1

Bc in the 80s the creaters of valtrex couldnt sell their medicine bc AIDs and syphillis and hepatitis were around and people werent concerned about a skin blister . So they launched a huge fear mongering ad campaign that morphed into the insanity and fear surrounding herpes today.  Go into a room. 8 out of 10 people you see in that room have hsv1. 3 out of 10 have hsv2. Most don't know. There is cancer, aids, diabetes, parkinsins, mulitple sclerosis, leprosy,  ALS, alzheimers, polio, malaria, smallpox, huntington's disease, muscular dystrophy, tuberculosis...the list goes on. Herpes in its worst day doesn't hold a candle. My advice. Get off this forum.  Go outside. Smell the fresh air, look at the blooming trees. Realize you can hear, see, smell, walk. There's no bombs going off, you are safe. You have shelter. Clothes ,food , clean water. You are going to be ok
 And please see a Therapist . I have depression too and getting a hsv2 diagnosis was hard. But at the e d of the day I am very, very lucky that's all I have. DM me if you need to talk",2022-04-02 15:20:50,1

I think it would break so many things. The trust, the way I see him. The way he sees me. I would also think about “did he give it to me on purpose so I don’t leave him? So it’s easier for him to be with me?”. 
That’s what I’m thinking about when I don’t want to disclose. I don’t want to end up in a situation where people can tell me I’m reckless, that I don’t care or break someone’s trust in me. I would have a hard time having sex with someone in a relationship if I knew they didn’t accept me for all me. I would have it in the back of my mind when they touch me.

For causal sex, a lot of doctors say you don’t have to disclose and I’m a little more loose with that. If people don’t ask you for your sexual health history and don’t want to use condoms, well, they could might as well get it from the next person (these are the people you SHOULD use condoms with tho). Then they’ve kinda already accepted whatever is about to come. 
But what if it turns into something more? What if I give it to someone and he gives my name a bad rep? What if THAT ruins a potential good relationship. Not the herpes, but me lying? 

I don’t want to disclose all the time. I want to have unbothered casual sex, like I did before. Life seemed so easy and careless back then. But then I think about all of that, and I’m not ending the stigma if I just keep my mouth shut. It’s not even about their sexual health, it’s about me having a clean conscience and accepting myself. If I can’t accept me for me, how can other people?

If you are suffering from depression and herpes is impacting your mental health you should be prioritising your well being by going and seeking professional help from a therapist or counsellor so you can work through your feelings and come to terms with herpes. Disclosing can actually be pretty empowering once you tackle it head on and come to accept it.

I didn’t know a lot about herpes before. If someone told me they had it I would need some time, but I think I would also discover what I now know (even though there’s a bigger risk from male to female, so I would count that in if I rejected someone). 

I plan on disclosing to everyone, but I don’t know if there will be a time where it slips my mind because herpes is not present in my everyday life. The thing is, we are not obligated to disclose to you. It’s the moral thing to do, but we are not obligated. So be grateful that you’ve been with someone that took responsibility for their health, got tested and disclosed their status to you, even though it was a bit late. 

It does suck that I got it, but hey, it’s the risk you’re taking when you’re having sex. I had a good time with whoever gave it to me. I don’t think they gave it to me on purpose or they even knew they had it (my experience is that a lot of men don’t get tested or go to the doctor).

tuen5o,Fair enough here in Canada the blood test isn’t offered in a standard STd panel either you have to ask for it and even when you do they are reluctant to do it because they know a bunch of people are asymptomatic and feel like the psychological impact is far worse so they say best to only get tested if you actually see a sore.

I don’t know if you went on my profile but I asked about some bumps that I got in 2018 when I was with my ex but at the time dr told me they didn’t think it was hsv and didn’t swab me but I ended up doing blood work for piece of mind and then I kept testing negative after that up until this year so I assumed I didn’t get anything from my e.x. Bcs I figured ir it was by now it would show in my antibodies But then in sept I had a new partner and like 8 days later I started having symptoms .. didn’t see any sores but every other symptom I had so I’m like ok I’ve always been negative prior to this guy so if my blood work ends up being positive I assume maybe it’s from him. But I know igg can miss like 30% of HSV1 cases so now im like shoot what if I end up having it and I actually caught it from my ex and that was my initial OB but I had no idea.. then I would feel even worse that I potentially gave it to this guy.

This sentence is incoherent and I have no idea what you actually meant.

No, that is NOT okay. Having sex with someone knowing you have an STD, and not informing them is a terrible and irresponsible thing to do.

You are wasting your breathe by responding to me, so don't be hypocritical.

Completely irrelevant. I don't have to experience something to be able to make moral judgements of actions. Giving someone herpes cause you are afraid you won't get a relationship is immoral, evil, and disgusting. Saying that it is somehow moral and okay because ""your life is hard"" is horrible and disgusting. Also, funny how everyone keeps saying ""it's just herpes haha, why are people so afraid of it?"" and then go ""we suffer greatly from it"". Yeah sure, you suffer from it so much that you are okay to spread this disease to get laid, or to a person you supposedly want to be in love with. How caring of you to give them herpes!

>To choose between humiliation and possible social exposure, and rejection or weighing out the chances of someone else contracting this disease, its a hard time for us to decide and choose this is the reality of a hsv positive person, and you cannot relate so why are you here talking to hsv positive people??

There is one morally correct choice - be an adult and disclose. Tell the person you want to have sex with that you have it, otherwise, again, you are choosing to infect someone with a permanent STD, just to make sure they won't deny you sex.

That is in an absolute, immoral, and there is no right to defend people who do this.

The itching comes and goes and I live in constant fear of another outbreak since that's the *sign* have gone to the Drs and been swabbed out of paranoia and been negative.

I might just swap back to the Vaclovir since I have scripts for both!
The meds do help. But I'm always tired and I like chocolate which can also be triggers to an outbreak. So the paranoia never goes.
And agree how do you know when is a safe time to have sex if the itching is almost always present?!
I've only had intercourse twice (same fella) since my diagnosis and actually paid to get swabbed and make aure I was clear before I saw him I was so anxious.
I just wanna get back on the horse without stress...

So I empathise with you completely. Not only is the itching physically annoying, it's also mentally and emotionally draining too bc of it all. Are you on antivirals to help?

I have them on a repeat prescription for whenever I need them, but since this is constant (although I fear I may also be having a second OB right now), it sounds like it's worth trying them all the time. I'm on Aciclovir (3x400mg) atm so going to see how that goes with this potential OB and either switch or stick, good to know another name of antivirals that work! 

I'm in the same boat as you, diagnosed BPD in 2020, and it sucks trying to regulate symptoms to battle HSV. I love chocolate too, and wasn't a big drinker of late but did enjoy going out with friends once a week. Hardest to kick has definitely been the chocolate (still haven't entirely). Same with always tired too bc of the insomnia. And yeah, sex is super high on the list of things important to us, so it really sucks not having it be how it always has been. BPD and HSV are really far from the best combination in the world with everything we have to and have gone through! That said, I did also see it as a chance to fully work on my mental health, so I've renewed my fight to get therapy (we both know how rough that is), so there's definitely a silver lining to it. It also made me realise how much I need to work on loving myself. The cure research is also massively keeping me going. 

As a BPD side note, have you ever tried quitiapine? It's an anti-psychotic that they put me on bc, idk if you're from the UK, GPs can't prescribe mood stabilisers, has to be done by a psych, so I got put on those. Does nothing in terms of mood stabilisation for me, personally, but does knock me out. Feeling the difference while I'm waiting for my prescription to be filled for sure!",2022-04-03 13:18:24,2

I don't have any other symptoms that I've had before with thrush other than the itching, and unfortunately I think the ramping up of the itching I had when I made this post was because of a new OB possibly, although not 100% on that as it could also be general skin irritation, but looking likely.

Meanwhile I now take my antivirals religiously and don't care if I have to till the day I die!
Agree it's totally changed my perspective on sex.
I used to have a lot of FWBs and had decided to try to settle down to something more serious.
The BPD diagnosis rocked me but was also kind of a relief. Finally answers as to why I had always destroyed everything that crossed my path. I realised I was passionately loving but also poison at the same time...
 I've fixated on someone recently and its just bringing my worst side out. The irrational thinking and fears and paranoias.
He had seemed keen on me but I had another FWB come to visit after 2.5yrs apart (Thanks Covid) so now he's cooled right off. I'm devastated. Was honest about my HSV diagnosis last time I saw him too and was afraid he would reject me completely after that. Thankfully he didn't and we still have a friendship at least!
Isn't it awful when u want someone so badly it consumes you and then we have this to deal with on top of it.  I just feel cursed at times!!

Fr! I've never been more thankful for the online world, here especially, it's made things so much less daunting and lonely.

Most cases of HSV 1 are transmitted during asymptomatic shedding periods. 
Just because GHSV 1 is statistically less aggressive doesn't mean that it stays dormant forever in everyone. If you haven't experienced any outbreaks regularly, you are very lucky, congratulations.  Unfortunately, many people do experienced frequent outbreaks; just take a look at the many groups dedicated to herpes here on Reddit.

I never want to be the person who ruins someone else's life. I wish I had been given the truth every day of my life. I'll take on the burden of disclosing and being uncomfortable if that means giving someone a choice.

When ppl say, “I wish I was given a choice” or something similar it usually means they would have said “no thanks” because the reality is the risk is always there when being involved with someone who is positive despite precautions. So you avoid herpes this time but how do you go about managing future prospects? No one promotes what it would truly take to avoid herpes which consists of full panel testing prior to touching/kissing or intimate activity and then a followup test 12-16 weeks later to verify the “all clear”. Or promote finding “the one” early in life, do your verification testing and stay with that person for  life.

Your Dr. may not know as much about STD's as they should. You will learn that herpes is incredibly common. AT LEAST 1 in 6 ppl 14 - 49 yo has it. And it's probably more b/c many ppl are asymptomatic or nearly so. You'll also learn that outbreaks lessen in frequency and severity over time for most, and that certain aggravating factors can be controlled. Chief among these is attitude. If you obsess about it, herpes will control you. If you accept it, you'll have more control over it.

If you indeed have herpes, I agree that you should disclose it. Your new partner may indeed take off, but they'll probably do that if you don't disclose and then pass it to them. So, get it out of the way. You'll be armed with information, so if the other person is a reasonable sort, you might be able to educate them and keep them from freaking out. Also, you can ask if they've ever been tested and, if not, suggest it. If they happen to carry it but are asymptomatic, then what's the harm in sleeping with you? If they shut down on you, then I agree they may not be the best relationship material anyway. I hope this helps.",2022-04-02 16:54:49,1

ttw3me,"I agree. But keep in mind, the group is heavily biased towards negative feelings. Most people who are ok with the risk of getting it from a partner while they themselves are negative are not searching reddit groups to post on. They just move on with their life.

So they enjoy the casual, free-spirited aspects of modern dating culture thinking “hey, I used a condom so I’m good to go.” What’s interesting is once disclosure occurs how much the narrative changes. Condom but no STD talk = sex occurs. Condom but disclosure = no sex or regretful/fearful sex occurs. Outcome is the same if sex occurred since risk is present but disclosure causes mental turmoil.  Given how ppl tend to manage dating,  I’m inclined to think  ppl would rather “bury their head in the sand.”",2022-04-02 07:43:19,3

If more people were open-minded about herpes, then it truly would not be a big deal. But the way it is transmitted and the fact that so many people either don't have it (genital herpes) or don't admit to having it is what causes issues.

I've disclosed and had guys beg not to use a condom 🥴 You never know how someone's going to react and what risks they're comfortable with. But, before I got it, it definitely would've been a deal breaker for me for casual/ONS. If I saw long term potential, I might've educated myself a bit more. Also funny to me that out of all the men I've been with, not one has disclosed.",2022-04-02 03:57:15,2
ttw3me,"It's not, since there have been quite a few people on here who have spoken about contracting hsv despite their partner being on meds and using condoms - docotrs and sexual health nurses make it quite clear that there is no guaranteed way to stop transmission, if there was there would be little reason to disclose. The stats around transmission depend on the type of hsv and where hsv is located. Shedding for hsv2 genitally for example occurs something like 20% in a year, versus 4% for hsv1 genitally. So if you then use antivirals you're at 10% shedding and 2% shedding for hsv1 genitally. Condoms I believe reduce transmission for men to women by around 95%. So for hsv2 genitally you're looking at 2% and hsv1 it's near zero, in a year. The herpes handbook from westover heights has stats on transmission rates. We know the vast majority of people with herpes are completely asymptomatic. In fact statistically speaking the ones suffering outbreaks are in the minority. 80% don't have symptoms. In one study that followed couples, only a third of participants that acquired hsv from their partner experienced outbreaks.",2022-04-02 13:10:32,1

tugnnx,No,2022-04-02 16:04:17,1
tugnnx,"If you only have ghsv2 then you can not transmit it from your mouth to someone else’s genitals. That would be only genital to genital area contact ( either when there is an OB or period of viral shedding. ). 

I’m not sure about your second question ? Do you mean he is ghsv2 positive and you negative ?  If so then you can get hsv but it won’t be ohsv1 if he is ghsv2 positive , it will be ohsv2 ( which is more uncommon ). 

Hsv strain doesn’t change depending on location , you can only transmit or get infected with the strain the other person has. ( just change the location ohsv to ghsv and add the strain after 1 or 2)",2022-04-02 12:16:21,0

tugnnx,"okay so im a guy. my partner is a woman. we split for a while and got back together. someone she hooked up with for a bit gave her HSV2. so ill rephrase now that you have context. 
1. if she (she has HSV2) gives me (a man without hsv) oral sex while shes having an outbreak in her genital area NOT in her mouth, can the virus be transmitted? 
2. i am pretty positive she gave oral sex to the guy she was with previously that ended up giving her HSV2. would her giving him oral sex cause her to get any kind of HSV strain in her mouth?",2022-04-02 12:22:50,2

tugnnx,"Ok. So first off , she has had an outbreak before , diagnosed with a swab ?  Reason I ask is a a fair amount of people haven’t had an OB , get tested with an igg antibody test , end up with a low positive which end up being a false positive. So testing. method and actual numerical result do matter especially with hsv2 as some genital hsv is hsv1 ( shed less & possibly lower OB frequency so not as transmissible )

So if the person she was with was a confirmed ghsv2  then it is possible she has both ghsv2 & ohsv2 ( but hsv2 is not common to the oral area , so even if she did have oral sex it doesn’t mean she has ohsv2 also. ). 

Regarding hsv1 though , a lot , up to 7O % of us have that and a lot of us are asymptomatic or have never been tested , so therefore we assume we are negative. Igg testing  doesn’t help squelch that misconception either as it’s a far from perfect test with 30% false negative rate.   Ohsv1 positive person can transmit their virus to a partners genitals also during an Ob or viral shedding thru oral sex. 

If she is hsv +, daily  antivirals & condoms reduce the transmission a lot.    I can’t remember the percentages but I’m sure they are on this subs page and more info can be found in Herpes handbook by Expert Terri warren",2022-04-02 13:05:14,1
tugnnx,"Yes outbreak usually means blisters , cold sores , lesions of some sort.  Viral shedding you may have some symptoms but a lot of us don’t , and we are still contagious during at that time.

tugnnx,"she had her first outbreak a few days ago. she had one single sore in her genital area. thought it was a a razor burn or ingrown hair. she fucked with it a little and it started to look like what you see when you google herpes sores. two doctors saw it and said they didnt think it was herpes. first doc lost the swab results so we went to an urgent care and she got swabbed and it was a positive test. she hasnt done the igg antibody test. when we went to urgent care they swabbed her and had her give a urine sample. her vaginal area was hurting like a mfer/tingling/pins and needles feeling in her lowerback and she startred taking valtrex about 36hrs ago and she said shes feeling better so i doubt theres any chance she doesnt have it. 

how can we find out if she has ohsv2? she wanted to give me oral sex earlier and my ignorance on this stopped her from doing it, and i know it made her feel bad :( 

is there anyway you can give me any advice on how to stay safe if/when we start having sex? like how long after an outbreak is it safe to have unprotected sex if shes on antivirals? and how long should she be on antivirals before its safe to have unprotected sex? obviously i know not to engage during an outbreak. 


so basically, as long as she doesnt have sores in her mouth, she can give me oral sex even if she has in outbreak in her genital area?",2022-04-02 13:18:21,1
tugnnx,"Ok. So she has a positive swab.  And the swab confirmed hsv2 ?  They actually told her it’s hsv2 ?  

She wouldn’t need an igg test to confirm the positive swab , info that the igg at the time of a first Ob can point to is if it’s a new infection or not , because it can take several weeks to months for the antibody levels to be detected and return a positive test. 
With hsv until you actually have an OB there isn’t a way to know what location has it. Generally hsv1 prefers the oral area and hsv 2 the genital area. You can get both in both locations but it’s rare to have ohsv2 and if you do I’m sure I read transmission rate is low due to infrequent shedding / OB.

i have not. i tried a few weeks ago just cause and the doctor told me its unnecessary if i dont have any symptoms. but im going to get one forsure now. her and i have not engaged in any sexual activity yet, but i feel like knowing if i have asymptomatic hsv would probably help this situation a lot. if i were to have asymptomatic hsv1 or hsv2, would it even matter to take safety precautions sexually with her? like if i have either of those asymptomatically, would having unproected sex with her cause me to start having symptoms?",2022-04-02 14:26:56,1
tugnnx,thank you so much for taking the time to talk to me/give me info. i really appreciate you,2022-04-02 14:27:38,1
tugnnx,"She should find out which she tested positive for as it does make a difference with transmission rates. Usually when people ( esp. women talk about 1st OB they say hsv2 ones tend to have more than 1 blister .  

If I were you 2 , I would both go and get the hsv igg test. ( Just a note though , it isn’t 100 accurate , especially with hsv 1 there can be a fair number of false negs , so a negative test doesn’t always mean you are actually negative . 30% false neg. & hsv2 8%). Low values of hsv2 tests may need repeat or confirmatory western blot - due to false positives at low values of under 3.5).  

If your igg came out positive for hsv1 and she has same strain then it would be highly unlikely to get it again in another location. Not impossible but not probable.  

And keep in mind she knows she has hsv and you 2 will likely be a lot more careful than others who just assume due never having. an OB that they are negative.

And her having. it and if you were asymptomatic then no its the same as if you were having sex with someone neg. One persons status doesn’t won’t make you symptomatic .

If the dr is saying they don’t know which hsv then I think they may have ordered an igm which is pretty useless and not appropriate for hsv. 

Igg can’t tell you location. If you had cold sores as a kid then expect the hsv1 to be positive. If your hsv 2 is also then it’s possible you have that too , but if a low positive , under 3.5 then it is possible that it’s a false positive.",2022-04-02 13:24:19,1

I've used 1/4 which hazel, 1/4 70% isopropyl alcohol, 1/4 water, 1/4+ tea tree oil for a solution. You could apply the mixture on some cotton or toilet paper around the vulva and just out side the vagina (not all the way inside).

tu1hum,"GHSV1 is actually the least contagious out of all of them because it does not shed often. “genital HSV‐1 causes fewer recurrences (few or none after the first year of infection) and is shed asymptomatically infrequently.” Source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2564733/#:~:text=Genital%20HSV%E2%80%901%2C%20which%20almost,and%20is%20shed%20asymptomatically%20infrequently. — obviously if she’s having an active outbreak she is shedding and you need to avoid having sex.

It is also more difficult for a woman to give HSV to a man: “Men may be up to four times less susceptible to acquiring genital herpes than women (P = 0.006)” Source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC544977/

This is about antivirals: “One study addressing this question found that women on suppressive acyclovir (400 mg, twice daily) had a 94% reduction in subclinical shedding while taking daily therapy. This type of study has also been done with famciclovir and valacyclovir, with similar reductions seen in both men and women.” Source: https://www.ashasexualhealth.org/herpes-treatment/#:~:text=One%20study%20addressing%20this%20question,in%20both%20men%20and%20women.	⁠⁠

Here’s a statistic that might ease your mind. For GHSV2 (which sheds more often than GHSV1 and is therefore more likely to be spread) if you have sex twice a week, every week, for 1 year, your risk of transmission is 4%. If you use a condom, this drops to 2%. If you use a condom and take a daily antiviral, it drops to 1%. Keep in mind, if you have sex less than this then the risk is lower. 

Terri Warren, a leading herpes expert, has said that in her 30 years of working, she has rarely seen someone who acquired GHSV1 from genital to genital sex. It is almost exclusively acquired from oral sex. I unfortunately cannot find the source, i originally found it on reddit, it’s somewhere on her website. — I know this is true for male to female transmission, i’m not positive about female to male though.",2022-04-01 22:37:25,7

ttw1qz,"r/HerpesCureResearch is a good place for info. from what i gather, a cure would strengthen our natural defenses, which works by wrapping up the virus in a sort of shield to keep it within the nerve cells. the shedding and OBs occur when the virus isnt tightly bound by this shield.",2022-04-01 18:18:02,4

I have hpv and hsv for reference. Also if you Google pics of both to tell they never look like most pics online. Hpv never looks like a sore or red. It is more like a skin tag or a mole but skin coloured :).

tu3199,"Yeah you get bumps but you get warts. They look very different. You could still have hpv although this definitely isn't it. Most hpv doesn't even cause genital warts. If you have the type that does it is said to be the safe type of hpv anyways. 

For me personally I'm 20. You can only get it properly tested when you're 21. I got it when I was 17 and I did get genital warts. Had them treated and they've gone away. Thought my body cleared of it (can't check until I'm 21) but since getting herpes I've been getting them again. 3 years after :/ which is unusual but my immune system in general didn't take herpes well sadly. I've been having one wart coming back constantly but for the past week haven't seen anything so hopefully won't come back. 

You can clear of genital hpv so don't worry about it. I'm currently doing the hpv vaccine (only had 1/3 done, waiting for more) which will help from other hpv strains and as I've read not sure if true but could potentially help body fight off the one you already have.

>So you’re allowed to say it’s good, but I’m not allowed to say it’s bad. I don’t think that’s how it works.

OP didn't say it was good. She didn't provide any general, moral assessment of casual sex at all. She was clearly talking about how she feels about it herself: that she views it as a positive thing that she enjoys.

>Everyone’s allowed to say whatever they want.

Not quite, no. OP was saying that she enjoys a particular activity, while you're making a sweeping and highly subjective negative moral judgement about that activity. 

>You’re like a smoker with lung cancer that’s complaining that he can’t continue smoking. I don’t think anyone has pity for someone who thinks like that. I sure don’t.

And that's a false analogy with yet more highly inappropriate judgement.

Casual sex is a hugely common activity that a huge number of consenting people enjoy. You're free to state that you *personally* don't like casual sex, or that you consider it problematic, and you're free to explain why. But you're not free to make sweeping moral judgements about such activities, or about the people who engage in them, and present them as something beyond personal opinion -- and especially when such opinions are very highly subjective and the extent that morality even plays a role in such behaviors is highly questionable -- when replying to users in this sub who engage in them.

ttr3gy,"Yes, I have. I have GHSV2, and even with that, doctors and official sites for sexual health in my country says it’s not necessary to disclose for hook up’s. I’m still going to do it because I don’t want to end up in a situation where people can accuse me of passing it on purpose or being reckless. I also think it really would affect a relationship if I had to disclose further down the road. 

I think you should tell her that you have hsv1, the type that causes cold sores. She can get ghsv1 anyway just from oral with another person so I don’t think it’s deceiving at all.
If you tell her it’s genital, then add that you’ve spoken to all these medical professionals and that you’re actually not obligated to tell her, but you do it because you like her and want to be honest with her. And because you’re not obligated, the next person might decide not to tell her because of that (and the stigma).",2022-04-01 14:03:52,3
ttr3gy,"What about telling her your ex used to get cold sores sometimes and you got tested for it and it came up + in your blood test but you've never had symptoms? I feel like that's a really casual way to frame it. It makes it seem like no biggie (everyone has or knows someone who gets cold sores) and it doesn't affect your life, but you've also done the due diligence of telling her. 

I think you should tell her because, regardless of how small the risk is, OBs are SERIOUSLY worse on women just because of our anatomy. Would suck for her to deal with that eventually and for you to have that on your conscience.",2022-04-01 21:28:25,1
ttr3gy,I was thinking of starting the disclosure talk with something like 'do you get regular sexual health checks? have you ever had cold sores? I get regular STI checks while dating and a few years ago...',2022-04-02 08:37:42,1
ttr3gy,"I'd be lying if I told her that, because the truth is I got a breakout and the way I tested positive was that I had the sores swabbed. To your second point, I agree I do need to disclose regardless.",2022-04-02 08:35:46,1

ttmns3,Honestly I use conditioner hahaha. A best friend of mine who hides my secret with me always comes up with investigations to make my world better and she told me about conditioner. Has worked amazing so far ! ❤️‍🔥,2022-04-01 16:11:49,10
ttmns3,Use a trimmer. Iv been using a trimmer for years and it doesn’t cause ingrown hair so no break outs for me.  Or I wax. Waxing will cause a breakout for me usually but they are mild and don’t last long but the wax lasts several weeks,2022-04-01 09:40:35,5
ttmns3,I shaved the other day and im worried about this too. I'm going to eventually need to get laser hair removal down there because I dont wana be freaking out all the time,2022-04-01 22:13:14,5
ttmns3,are you sure it’s an outbreak ? might just be razor bumps/ irritation,2022-04-01 20:02:53,5
ttmns3,Embrace the bush 🤣 that's where I'm at anyways lol,2022-04-01 21:17:41,3
ttmns3,BABY OIL GEL!!! several types or any oil as well as conditioner has as well saved me from breakouts now. also only shaving periodically and genitally sparingly. i like to keep a landing strip and only shave that once every few months and that reduces all razor burn irritation and breakouts,2022-04-01 22:30:03,3
ttmns3,Laser hair removal is the answer,2022-04-01 22:43:00,3

ttmns3,+1 for a trimmer! I remove the guard and am able to take it pretty far down (but not so far as to irritate!) [bikini trimmer on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00005JS5C/ref=cm_sw_r_sms_api_i_8RGDGX9EX1TNJZMBPGT9?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1),2022-04-01 12:13:55,2
ttmns3,Having this issue at the moment myself 😭,2022-04-01 14:28:53,2
ttmns3,I suggest just trimming or waxing since it only needs to be done about once a month.,2022-04-01 16:02:20,2
ttmns3,Hair remover cream?,2022-04-01 16:58:00,2
ttmns3,Honestly waxing slowed the irritation for me,2022-04-01 17:22:09,2
ttmns3,"First I trim down with a buzzer trimmer thing then I shave basically the bikini line area and it's never triggered any OB. Always shave with clean blades and cover that hooha in conditioner or shaving cream for extra protection against irritation! Otherwise, consider laser or hair removal cream maybe?",2022-04-01 17:39:35,2
ttmns3,That’s not due to the hsv. It’s razor rash. Try using Nair.,2022-04-01 20:26:50,2
ttmns3,Get Lasik best decision I ever made. I don't get outbreaks often at all!,2022-04-01 20:37:36,2
ttmns3,I use a trimmer so it doesn't touch or irritate the skin. Then exfoliate every time I am in the shower and lotion up twice a day [morning and evening].,2022-04-01 21:45:33,2
ttmns3,I just get a waxing. I use to have the same problem.,2022-04-01 21:56:17,2
ttmns3,"Do sugar, I do mine every 3-4 weeks and never get an outbreak. Sugar waxing is natural and is not harsh on your skin. You can get on Amazon, my sister uses that one and I’ve used it myself to do my Brazilian also my wax lady used to do it but I’ve learned how to do it myself and I do it now. I used the brand sugar.doh on IG it’s amazing for beginners and the brand on Amazon is Luxury pro.",2022-04-01 22:32:10,2
ttmns3,I use soap lather and shave but idk tho everyone’s different i heard waxing helps,2022-04-01 22:39:33,2
ttmns3,Go the natural way. I live in nyc uni wax is great! I had the same problem... Waxing is the best route for me.,2022-04-01 23:53:30,2
ttmns3,Don't be. It hurts for a split second or two but it worth it. I rather be in pain for a little bit than dealing with an outbreak  lol. Whomever handle your waxing will tell u which area hurts the most. I feel like my butt hole area is painful.,2022-04-02 00:20:11,2
ttmns3,"Shaving isn't a normal thing for the body, especially in the vaginal and armpit areas.  Why shave?  Bring the bush back.  Men love hairy armpits.  Just my observation.",2022-04-02 11:54:10,2
ttmns3,Does being hairless cause more friction and trigger outbreaks? As a female,2022-04-01 20:22:01,1
ttmns3,Get a trimmer it’s wayyy better and doesn’t cause enough friction to break the skin for potential infections,2022-04-01 21:07:36,1
ttmns3,Thank you,2022-04-01 23:40:58,1
ttmns3,A trimmer. Like mens hair clippers??,2022-04-01 14:36:09,2
ttmns3,I use the Phelps one blade and it helps a lot,2022-04-02 05:21:53,1
ttmns3,Yesss!!! Me too!! Its the scariest feeling. Im definitely going to look into the prices and see what can be done for me.,2022-04-02 00:15:33,3
ttmns3,Sometimes its razor bumps and sometimes its the actual hsv. I know the difference now. i always feel like im triggering something after a shave.,2022-04-01 23:42:18,1
ttmns3,Lmfaoooo same but I’m getting tired of it and i wanna get a trimmer,2022-04-02 14:52:59,2

ttmns3,Yes when i get some money im def going to invest in some treatments.,2022-04-01 23:40:29,1
ttmns3,Yeah. Crazy,2022-04-02 12:19:07,2
ttmns3,Do you use just normal sugar wax?,2022-04-01 16:55:21,1
ttmns3,Thanks so much!!! Im definitely going to try this. Do use any kind of lotion to trimm or just dry?,2022-04-01 14:57:07,1
ttmns3,Thanks,2022-04-02 00:14:09,1
ttmns3,Its not a razor rash. Its the hsv.,2022-04-01 22:37:32,5
ttmns3,Is that a laser treatment?,2022-04-01 23:45:58,1

ttmns3,Thank you!!!,2022-04-01 23:48:10,1
ttmns3,Im so scared but I want and need the same success. Do you wax yourself or do you go somewhere. Does it hurt real bad?,2022-04-02 00:11:44,1
ttmns3,It's the action of removing hair that could mainly. However I'd say when ylur hair starts to grow out it could potentially be more irritable and causing more friction but that's dependent on lingerie and sex.,2022-04-01 23:44:17,3
ttmns3,i use the gillette venus bikini trimmer. 100000% recommend it,2022-04-02 00:24:58,5

ttmns3,No I use hard wax beads.. melt it down and apply strips,2022-04-01 17:05:36,2
ttmns3,I purchased a wet/dry trimmer,2022-04-02 01:36:19,1

ttuoto,"Hey, I put off dating for a long time because I was intimidated by disclosure and was certain I'd be rejected anyway. Eventually I got very lonely, missed my relationships and decided to go for it. Since then I have been much happier, I am way more knowledgeable about herpes (which has made me a more responsible person when it comes to sex and relationships in general) and I believe has also made me more compassionate towards people who have any sort of lifestyle affecting condition. I have yet to be rejected for hsv.

I think you are onto a winner with your current outlook - don't be scared but be realistic when it comes to disclosure, don't just go around disclosing willy nilly, don't just stick it on your dating profile. My advice is to wait for your 3rd date, if you start to feel like you want to pursue a relationship, that's when I like to get it out the way. That way I am not so attached that I'd be depressed if I'm rejected, but at the same time I know I am genuinely interested. I also make sure I disclose to people who I think can handle it - are they mature, are they caring/kind, are the non-judgemental, do they like to gossip about the private life of friends, are they melodramatic? If I don't get the right answers to those questions, I make a choice not to continue seeing them. In many ways, it's actually a pretty good filter. 

I do it over text, something confident and direct but allowing them enough space to go away and research, the option for them to bail without criticism or judgement from me and the offer of answering as many questions as they would like. I keep it upbeat, real and stick to the facts around transmission risk. I try not to make it a massive essay nor do I make it sound like I have the plague or am a leper. Every girl I've disclosed to has thanked me for doing it over text rather than in person; they've said doing it in person would have put too much pressure on them. Each has had about 24 hours of wobbling/stressing before coming back and saying they're cool with it. We inevitably end up discussing it in detail in person. 

The caveat to the above is this is my approach to longer term relationships - I don't really do ONS or casual sex, so I've no advice as to how to handle that (although I'd probably go about it the same to be honest). Also I am a man who dates women, I know there's some debate around it being harder for men to be accepted but so far so good for me.",2022-04-01 17:36:22,2

tu11md,"Ok. thought maybe you were a low positive , usually less than 3.5.   Have read a few in here ended to testing neg on Western Blot with results of 7 ( they had never had OB )

If you have antibodies but no OB , it still means you have the virus & can transmit it even if you are asymptomatic .  Contagious during days of viral shedding.

ttyhmp,"Wait if you tested by blood test, how is it that they diagnosed it as oral genital? You say you had no symptoms orally? Did you have Genital symptoms?

ttqs5k,"Hi! I’m also a lesbian with ghsv1. And yes the risk is EXTREMELY LOW as long as you’re not having that direct genital to genital contact. And even then the risk is low since “Tribbing and scissoring” is much more gentle than PIV sex is so there won’t be like tearing and friction on the tears which makes transmission easier. You’d be much more likely to get ghsv1 from the other 60% of the population that has oral herpes and doesn’t know about it (asymptomatic). 

But yes the risk is ohsv1, but like ohsv1 is SOOO common. Have you been tested for hsv? There’s a chance you already have hsv1! And with ghsv1 having one of the least amounts of shedding (less than ghsv2 and ohsv1) the risk of you contracting ohsv1 from going down on her is EXTREMELY low even.

Also if you don’t mind me asking, how old are you? And how old is your partner?",2022-04-01 14:58:08,2
ttqs5k,"As a kind of shorter answer, it is possible to contract  Genital HSV1 orally. The two common herpes viruses are type 1 and 2. Usually 1 is oral (think cold sores), and 2 is associated with genital Herpes, however, many people who have genital Herpes have type 1. 

It is possible to contract hsv digitally (fingers), orally, or genitally from any active lesion, or vaginal fluids during asymptomatic viral shedding. 

If you wanted to be extra careful you could introduce dental dams, gloves, and daily antiviral pills (to reduce viral shedding in the HSV positive person).",2022-04-02 06:45:07,1
ttqs5k,"Hi! Thanks so much for responding this is such great information!!

So, I very very very likely already have OHSV1 because my father has had it since before I was born (my mother has never had a cold sore, however) and my partner of 5 years had active cold sores at least twice a year, we kissed pretty much every day -- not with active cold sores but still.  HE (ok this was another life lol) actually told me about how he once gave GHSV1 to a woman by going down on her, so we were EXTREMELY careful with that...I actually never let him. Lol...that's also probably on being a repressed lesbian.  


To answer your question, I am 34 years old and she is 27 years old. We both came out later in life and she contracted hers from a male partner, just as it happens to go.",2022-04-01 15:06:29,2

ttu43q,"So I kind of did the same thing. I found out when I was 25 and I know where mine came from, no hard feelings on the guy he didn't do it purposely.

But I kind of shut down, I stopped dating and became celibate for about 3 years. (2013-2016) 

In 2016 I finally decided to sort of try and date again. Definitely made it clear to every guy I talked to that I would NOT have sexual encounter on first or even second date. And if the guy got handsy or pushy I'd be like yeah I have genital herpes. What now, bitch

I agree with the author of this post in that I don’t disclose to anyone I am not serious with. My outbreaks are also very mild, and I only get 1 or 2 a year. I get them in weird spots like my lower back and stuff. I’m so not worried about herpes. If anything it makes me stronger. And that’s the most optimistic way that I can look at it. When I do get an outbreak, I leave it alone and pop a Valtrex and go about my life. It disappears and says goodbye for a while. 

I hope that people who are just finding out, or who are having a lot of trouble coping with their diagnosis, soon realize their life is not over. Once you accept the things you cannot change, that is a great day. Please feel free to ask questions as I love helping people.

tt2i45,"When you say that you don’t disclose to anyone you’re not serious with, do you mean that you don’t disclose to people you are having sex with if the relationship isn’t serious (ie. more casual partners), or that you don’t have sex with anyone until it’s serious, and then you disclose ahead of time? What if they ask first? Do you lie? 

I’m not judging you, I have this virus too, I know how it is. The reason I am asking is because of what happened to me. I had been dating the love of my life for nearly 3 years. We went on several dates and spoke for many hours before we ever had sex, so it was never casual. We were monogamous. He told me at the beginning of the relationship that he had just been tested and was free of any STIs. No disclosure. Then, a year in when we had the discussion about stopping the use of condoms because he got a vasectomy. No disclosure. Three years of open conversations where I told him literally every gross, weird, awkward, embarrassing sex story of my entire life, and even after I literally spent years working for the public health system and voiced that these STDs just aren’t that big of a deal, no disclosure. Even when I was having horrible symptoms down there that hot misdiagnosed for a UTI TWICE and he saw how much pain I was in, no disclosure. Almost three years in, one night we were having a conversation about a friend who has HIV. I made a comment that I would date and have sex with someone who has HIV if I really loved them since the virus and transmission can be so well prevented with condoms, antiretrovirals, and pre exposure prophylaxis (prep). Because of that, 5 days later, he finally disclosed. Let me tell you that the way he handled this made his disclosure so, so much worse on him than it would have been. I was livid, we had really tough conversations every day for weeks. I force him to listen to me educate him about this and discuss it, for hours, since his excuses were very uneducated about HSV. 

So my questions to you are, what if something that’s not serious becomes serious? When would you disclose then? Do you fear that their reaction will be much worse then, and a breakup will be worse? Why do you not disclose to casual partners? Is it because you’re on the medication and your transmission rate would be very low? Do you view the decision to have casual sex as accepting the risk that they might have something and not tell you? Kind of like you accept the risk of catching a cold if you hang out in enclosed, public spaces during flu season? Or does it just come down to not having enough of an interest in them to really care whether they go through this or not? I’m really interested in hearing your perspective here, because as someone who was not disclosed to, lied to, and caught it after doing everything right but asking for a physical copy of his STI results, I feel torn.  On one hand I have a deep compassion, and always have, for how difficult disclosure can be. On the other hand, I feel like it’s the right thing to do and easier in the long run. Or do you just always know right away on every occasion if something is ever going to be serious? Because I’ve had sex with plenty of people not knowing that. 

Anyway, sorry for the long post, and I look forward to hearing your perspective. Perhaps it will help me understand why my boyfriend did what he did.",2022-04-01 06:39:07,3

I know most people don’t like giving stats, but I do encourage my partner to research it. I let them know I’m on antivirals , I have never passed it on, and that I completely respect their decision either way.

tt2i45,"Nope! I just let my partner know and sometimes used condoms, most of the time not. I have a pretty mild version of it, if that’s a thing. I’ve also had it for 8 years so it’s possible my transmission rate is lower. I don’t know if that’s true or not though.",2022-04-01 00:28:13,2
tt2i45,"Everyone has different nuances in the experience with herpes. Some have it chronically(less common) and some have it completely asymptomatic. Well I’m a gay man. And I found the herpes on my butt the first outbreak. Then my lower back the second outbreak, and that was it. So I do wear condoms and I don’t. I’m also on PrEP for pre exposure to HIV to make sure I stay negative. Just do what your hearts says. If you want to disclose, disclose. If not, then don’t. But I recommended disclosing if a serious relationship comes along. 

I haven’t transmitted I believe because the herpes is mostly dormant, for me. Also, I apparently had HSV1 for years and years never one symptom. I’m guessing my symptoms I ever had were HSV2 since it was below the waist. Could be either or tho. Moral is do what you feel is right, and don’t willingly have sex during an outbreak. Hope this helped

P.S. — STOP staring at your phone waiting for a call. There’s not much you can do about it and just accept the things you can’t change. Don’t make yourself crazy over this.",2022-03-31 21:46:44,1
tt2i45,"Well, I’m not looking for anything serious at all.

I don’t hold this virus over anyones head either. I caught it, and I can’t point fingers. I don’t know if the person knew, or didn’t know. And I’ll never know. No one I’ve had sex with ever got it. If I am asked i will not lie. 

Here’s the thing, HSV is NOT on a standard 10-STD panel. The CDC tells physicians not to test for it unless the patient has symptoms. Therefore, people who think they got tested for “everything” herpes is not on that menu, unfortunately. So most people in the world have no clue they have it. You could of had it this whole time and not even knew, before you even got with your boyfriend. 

I would not do what your boyfriend did. As soon as I saw something going further than just one time sex, or a casual sex WITHOUT protection, I would disclose. But 80% of the population has it and disclosing it doesn’t have to be so dramatic since there’s a good chance the person you’re talking to has it already. I’m sorry that you’re frustrated with your boyfriend, but sometimes people just have a mental block when it comes to telling others. Also, he could of found out mid-relationship. Some people are married for years only to find out they suddenly have an outbreak. They think the other one is cheating but in reality the virus was just dormant for years and just decided to pop up. Before assuming someone lied, make sure they actually knew.

Also to mention, I usually use condoms when having sex. On the off chance that I don’t, I am the top.( I penetrate another man) My herpes is in a weird spot where it’s hard to transmit. It’s not on my penis at all, it’s on my lower back. If I am getting penetrated, being the bottom, I use condoms most of the time. I don’t disclose if we use a condom, and to the people I had unprotected sex with, I told them and they were ok with it.",2022-04-01 08:30:54,2
tt2i45,"Thanks.  I did read your other comments but it didn’t paint the clearest picture.  You said that with casual partners you didn’t disclose and you had a few that didn’t care when you did disclose.

No outbreak since Dec 30 so im hoping to be able to say it's dormant soon lol  I'm hoping that means I probably shed less.

I will never have sex during an outbreak.  So let's just pray I can keep this to myself. I'm so scared of transmission lol

Thank you again for replying",2022-03-31 22:02:59,2
tt2i45,"I know most people aren’t lucky enough to be screened specifically for HSV 1 and 2, but I was. I had a high risk pregnancy in the relationship that I had before him and was tested twice, six months apart. Then, when I had an STI screen a year later, my doctor ordered everything. She included IgG tests for herpes because I requested them - as I mentioned I worked in public health and dealt with STIs all the time, so fortunately I knew to ask and she agreed. I suppose there could be a chance that I got three false negative IgG tests over the course of over a year, but it seems unlikely. That’s neither here nor there to me at this point. 

He didn’t find out mid relationship. You make a good point, and I’ve heard sad stories about people who get accused of cheating when they did not cheat and their relationships are destroyed. But I wouldn’t accuse him of lying if I wasn’t sure. Plus, we once broke up for three months, so he could have easily claimed that’s when it happened if he wanted to. But he didn’t. He was honest. He found out ten years ago. He was with a girl who he knew had it, and then one night they got drunk and irresponsible and had sex when she had an outbreak. After he finally told me he did tell me the whole story of how it happened and when, which I’m glad he did. He actually knew the whole time, he told me he knew the whole time with me and with all of his relationships before me for the last 10 years. He was actually married once before and had a child and didn’t tell his ex wife. She still doesn’t know. He disclosed to me that he’s had upwards of 70 sexual partners that he didn’t tell. He’s literally never told a soul, not a friend, not a single person. Yeah once the floodgates opened he told me the whole truth, which I appreciate. I was supportive of how hard that must have been for him, it’s just the blatant lying that upset me. Nevertheless, I got over it.  It’s harder to find someone great to have a loving relationship with than someone who has herpes. 

I get what you’re saying though, and the way you handle it seems pretty reasonable to me. It seems you’d be very unlikely to transmit it during one encounter with the precautions you take anyway.",2022-04-01 09:22:46,2
tt2i45,"Let's break this down another way.

You are in an abusive relationship. You have a child. You are willing to stay in that relationship, exposing your child to this, because you don't want to leave because it may be difficult to find another who will accept you with herpes. 

No matter if you are alone for the rest of your days - which would only happen if you choose to let that happen - you are a parent first and foremost, and your child's health, safety and well-being come first. 

I accepted a man who was honest with me about having herpes. He was also divorced and had 2 kids. I accepted it all, happily. I ended up getting it, and though the relationship didn't last, we were together for several years. 

Herpes is never a good enough reason to leave a good relationship, or more importantly, to stay in a bad one. 

Please, take your child and leave.",2022-03-31 20:28:38,12
tt2i45,yes.. take your child and leave.. having herpes is one thing.. but  an  abusive relationship is an even scarier situation to have your kids around..please leave..I promise..herpes and whatever comes with it ain't nowhere as close to being as bad as your current relationship,2022-03-31 23:54:21,2

I've dated and slept with several people through the years who never knew I had it, and never got it from me to my knowledge. It sounds piggish, but that's how I have approached it. Even my doctor said without a current breakout, the chances of passing it are small, even though it's possible. (Full disclosure) I used condoms.

tt2i45,Once you have it in one place you can’t get it in the other. Your body builds antibodies which makes it impossible to transfer to a different body part. Unless you’re newly diagnosed cuz I believe it takes a month or 2 to get this “immunity.”,2022-04-01 08:53:23,1

Also don’t forget, mono is a herpes virus, chicken pox is a herpes virus, shingles is a herpes virus, and there’s a few more. It’s just that it’s considered an STD so there’s a huge stigma on it.

ttmfmc,I've used it during an OB without any issues!,2022-04-02 01:05:31,1
ttlemt,"Often a first OB happens within 2 -12 days of being exposed.  But it isn’t 100% that it will happen that way ,some people are exposed for ages and never become infected , others are infected 1 st time but never show symptoms , remain asymptomatic forever or until the virus no longer remains dormant and surfaces with an OB. 

Have you ever been tested before for hsv ?  Most people haven’t so even if someone infected you they may have been an asymptomatic and had no clue they were positive & even if they have been tested ( sti tests rarely incl hsv). On top of that the tests have a number of false negatives especially with hsv1 - 30%. And hsv2 8%. 

Was your OB confirmed with a swab test ?  Did they also give you a blood antibody igg test ? Which strain were you diagnosed with ?",2022-04-01 08:11:23,2

My statement is definitely selfish. But I’m also trying to understand genuinely what would be best for my mental health.  

The cdc came to this decision for a reason as I’m trying to understand why the authority on this stuff would handle things in such a way.  

Like say we found that 1/3 of all suicides are being caused by this. And 1/3 of all divorce. How should we handle that. 

Personally I think the answer would be to have everyone get tested to remove the stigma of it. But that seems to be difficult since most men especially never get tested for stds at all",2022-04-02 15:34:55,1

ttkcvz,"I didn’t have any reaction from covid (right at the start, march 2020!), and 2 vaxx doses. But I did have a pretty stellar OB when I got the booster and flu shot in the fall. But it was just the once, just regular healing time, and so much better than long covid!! You will be ok - mentally I agree is the toughest part but *IF* (and it’s a big if) you do break out there’s something comforting to know the trigger.

They don’t need to know, but it’s nice to have some support and ppl to talk to if ur having a rough time wth hsv

They probably made that comment because they don’t fully understand hsv, it’s just spread by skin to skin contact from affected regions (an active outbreak doesn’t always need to be present for this to happen). So unless ur doing that, anyone ur hanging out or talking wth will be fine lol. Educate them on it :)

Also unless y’all have bad friends for some reason , it’s honestly not and shouldn’t be a big deal or change anything. Friends should be supportive and understanding, and mine were luckily. I trust them and feel close to them",2022-04-01 13:49:57,1

I thought it was a bacterial infection, but I soon realized it could be herpes. I had two very small cuts/sores, so it was a mild first outbreak. I went to the doctor, she examined me and I started crying even though I already had accepted it in my mind. A couple of days later I got a positive result and my main partner accepted it, and wanted to continue our relationship. I also told the two others.

ttfc95,Can they swab a rash with no sores?,2022-04-01 07:16:08,1
ttfc95,"Hi,

First, as u/buttholeaddictxx already touched on, you *could* have your rashes PCR swab tested. Note that there are two different kinds of swab tests for herpes: viral culture and PCR. PCR is newer and is far more sensitive. If your rashes are being caused by herpes then PCR should detect it.

That being said, this sounds *very* unlikely to be herpes.

First, your partner's doctor thought her symptoms were impetigo *and* her symptoms responded to impetigo medication. 

You also said:

>While hanging out I noticed I felt very tired and kind of sick. But judging from what I read it was probably too early for my flu like symptoms to be herpes related since it had only been one day.

You didn't say what you meant by ""feeling sick"". Nausea? Or something else? Herpes would not cause nausea.

When it is said that herpes can cause flu-like symptoms, this is referring to symptoms similar to those of *influenza* (ie the *flu*) ie headache, fever, general body aches all over (not highly focused in and limited to a very specific area), light sensitivity, and swollen lymph nodes near the region of infection but not elsewhere (eg in the groin for genital infections, or in the head/neck for oral infections). Herpes would *not* cause symptoms of a cold, ie stuffy nose, runny nose, sore throat, cough, congestion, sinus issues, etc. (Oral herpes *could* cause a sore throat if it were to cause actual lesions in the throat itself, but that is very rare.)

Furthermore, the only circumstance in which herpes has the potential cause flu-like symptoms is from from a brand new infection that occurred within 2-10 days prior, and such symptoms would only occur if the person was experiencing at least moderate-to-extensive visible blisters/lesions as well, that would appear within a day or two of the flu-like symptoms, if not sooner.

You didn't experience any visible symptoms at all around the time of your tiredness and ""feeling sick"", so your tiredness and feeling sick were not caused by herpes.

> Fast forward about a month I developed a rash on my testicles and pretty extreme itching feelings all over my penis and testicles. My testicles then developed a rash almost all over them. My penis also has some small rashes on it under the head. I continued feeling slightly off for weeks going from doctor to doctor trying to find out what was going on with my penis. About 4-6 weeks after I got with her I found out I had mono. The rash never went away to my knowledge in those weeks but I can’t say for sure

Mono can cause a rash, as well as fatigue. Also, herpes is unlikely to cause a widespread rash in the absence of more pronounced symptoms. It is also very highly unlikely to cause intense itching in areas where there are no visible symptoms. Furthermore still, it is also highly unlikely to cause ongoing symptoms for the length of time that you've described.

>I have had probably almost 10 doctors tell me they do not thing it is herpes.

I agree that this sounds very highly unlikely to be herpes.

You're welcome.

>is herpes known to cause aching in the testicles? 

No, herpes would not cause aching in the testicles themselves, inside the scrotum. Herpes could cause discomfort on the scrotal skin if it were to cause visible symptoms on the scrotum, but it would not cause pain/discomfort/aching *inside* the scrotum on/in the testicles themselves.

I would also remind you that you say you've had about *ten* doctors now, all tell you that this isn't herpes either. So if you continue to be preoccupied with thoughts that this is herpes then it might be more appropriate to seek psychological assistance. In addition to diagnosis and treatment regarding whatever it is that is actually causing your symptoms. It seems that mono is a likely possibility, but perhaps you would gain additional peace of mind with further confirmation.",2022-04-05 02:03:50,1
tt2gdk,"Yeah, the issue isn’t really us or hsv. It’s stigma and cluelessness surrounding hsv in the general public and in the medical communities. 

The issue is that some of us are being tested and testing ourselves and the majority of people are not and they are too clueless/afraid to know their own statuses. Many, MANY of them would find out they are also hsv positive. But they think they are good bc of no symptoms. My sister had a Cold sore 20 years ago and she thought hsv just went away- she didn’t know it was forever. I am asymptomatic with a positive hsv2 test (it’s been 3 years and zero symptoms or outbreaks). Some of us test responsibility before and after each past/new partner and MANY don’t. 

I’m waiting on my western blot results. 

What I’ve concluded is this- I am more sexually responsible and not living in denial or delusions regarding sex or sexual choice anymore. 

Yes- relationships and sexual prows used to be more fun but it was ego and physical satiation- it wasn’t soul or reality. Yes, rejection sucks but that’s life. 

Grieving all of those realities are painful. Our society is built around Sex and a general cluelessness around it. Facing the reality of sex and stds and responsibility/irresponsibility changes things. It makes things serious and heavier. I’m okay with it though.

If my hsv2 is negative, Im not sure how I will feel moving forward. I would still choose someone I loved who was hsv2 positive because I feel like real and true connections beyond sex are rare- and I am here for them. If someone turns me down due to hsv, it means that me or the relationship wasn’t worth it to them. That’s okay and it’s also a filter for me.

Also, I’m fine with oral for me and/or my future partner even if I’m hsv2 negative. Life is full of risks and it’s really what’s worth it to someone else based on the education/insight/values/priorities they have. Everyone is truly different",2022-03-31 15:48:36,5
tt2gdk,"That’s how I feel—empowered. You care enough to know your status and disclose to others. That puts you ahead of the rest of the 65%+ with HSV.

> Oral is completely out of the question

Up to you, but that takes HSV from “I have a minor skin condition. I’m taking meds to protect you, but odds are if we fuck weekly for 26yrs you’ll get it.” to “You can never have oral or bare sex with me.” From personal experience the forner is rarely a dealbreaker. The latter I would never accept, lol.

Consider letting your partner drive what protections they want—informed consent. Most begin with condoms and work up to bare. My current partner went bare from the start. I take my pills",2022-03-31 15:47:11,5
tt2gdk,"> Shouldn't our partners feel relieved in the fact that we do know our status

Not at all, no. I rejected every single person that disclosed to me before getting it and fully expect rejection now. Having safer sex and just not talking about diseases like we all used to is infinitely more palatable than ""there is a chance you could largely lose access to casual sex forever, but here are some disease statistics.""",2022-03-31 21:04:03,1
tt2gdk,Thanks for sharing! I understand the perspective of being choosier in the search for love/deeper connections though.

We lose access to casual sex because of stigma (the one you have internalized), not the STI itself.

I don’t think I’ve internalized any stigma, it’s more like I just feel genuinely powerless to buck the status quo.

tt9h0w,My bad💀 I ask a lot of questions,2022-03-31 20:53:49,1
tt9h0w,"My understanding is, and FYI I'm a newbie, just diagnosed a couple weeks ago with HSV2, is that it is possible to get it in both locations if it's a new infection.  Till your body has built up enough antibodies is when you can be reassured that you're not going to infect the ""noninfected"" area.  Does that make sense?",2022-03-31 21:30:12,1
tt9h0w,"If you have only just been infected then it is definitely possible to autoinnoculate yourself orally, with the virus from your genitals. It is quite rare to have the same strain of virus in both locations, usually people will get it in one place and then build up enough antibodies over the first few months, to ensure they can not catch the same strain elsewhere. But it is possible during early infection.

So hygiene is important for you at the moment- make sure you wash your hands if you touch your genitals, try not to touch your face. Once you have antibodies then you don't really have to worry about it.

One last thing, hsv1 genitally is quite hard to transmit as far as herpes is concerned. It sheds one of the least frequently (you would be higher risk of spreading it if you had hsv1 orally for instance). Terri Warren an expert in herpes has said she's never seen someone pass genital hsv1 to the genitals of their partner, in 35+ years of her career. From a logistical/practical perspective, you have the most common strain of hsv, in a location with some of the lowest transmission risk for that particular strain. Your outbreaks will likely be less severe and less frequent than if you had oral hsv1 or genital hsv2, especially once you're past the 2 year mark.

tt44ww,"I'm currently going through a similar situation. Potential exposure was at the end of Sept.. and then shortly after I started experiencing severe burning, itching, tingling, my vagina got extremely red and swollen and just super irritated and at the same time, I started experiencing backaches. I freaked out and thought it was HSV bcs Ihad alllll the symptoms the only thing i did not have is any visible sores. everything lasted around 4-5 weeks and then finally started to quiet down but mild stinging remained and on going tingling sensations in my back and vagina. IT's the weirdest thing and I also can't move past it because I have no idea what else it could be. I'm convinced it's HSV as well bcs i have never had these tingling sensations down there in my life and it's also in my back and hasn't gone away. I still feel it everyday. 

I tested at 1 month, 3 months, and 5 1/2 months and all my Iggs have been negative so far but i don't know what else to do it's so uncomfortable and I'm worried about passing this on to someone else. I wish I could just ask the person I was with to get tested but we're not talking right now and when i did raise the concern with him in the past he mentioned never having any visible symptoms and being convinced that he's fine. He also mentioned getting tested and evrything came back negative but I know HSV isn't a part of standard STD testing so I don;t think he's been tested for it. I just feel like if he was also negative then atleast it would give me peace of mind. 

I think if i didn't have lingering symptoms, I would have dropped it by now but I just don't feel right. it feels off especially the tingling / prickling sensation in my back and vagina.. 

I was also wondering the same thing, if my antibodies are maybe just delayed. I also have an autoimmune disease. I have celiac so idk if that would impact it but yeah I did read on one thread that someone continued to test negative at 7 months but then finally tested positive at 10. so now I'm like... do I wait and get tested again in a few months.. or do I just drop it. but I'm just so tired. Dr is telling me to just assume I'm fine unless I see something and saying don't feel guilty bcs you did your due diligence and tested many times and I think I would have if I no longer felt anything bcs they do say the psychological impacts are far worse than the virus itself which is why they dont test people unless they have symptoms cs many people are asymptomatic.. but i just can't shake it because of the lingering symptoms.. 

I also wondered if i should just get the western blot bcs that's the gold standard apparently for hsv.. but i live in CAnada so not sure if i can do that. Have you looked into it? Maybe you can get your answer that way.",2022-04-01 03:54:19,1

And I want to believe it because my tests have been negative but the tingling stuff just doesn’t make sense. 

I have the same issue where I’ll be like ok I’m going to test one more time and if this is negative I’m over it and then I’ll think I’m ok or get temporary relief but then I start freaking out again because of the symptoms I’m having. 

like I said my dr said many people have it and just don’t know because they’re asymptomatic and that’s why they don’t test because it’s better for you to just not know than the psychological impact so I’m like should I just drop it and move on there’s no point in knowing… ?

tswwhx,"Hey I would recommend getting tested for yeast & BV (you would likely know if you have that though) in addition to mycoplasma & ureaplasma. My symptoms were a slight itch that wouldn’t go away,  and they are not routinely tested for. I’m not sure the relationship between itching and herpes. 


Finding a different doctor (even your Gyno if you have one) to prescribe you suppressive valtrex shouldn’t be an issue. But I think addressing the itching separately would be a great place to start. 


Yes to hydrocortisone cream externally, or you can try organic non-refined coconut oil, apple cider vinegar  baths and probiotic suppositories to help balance things out.",2022-03-31 15:15:39,3

Did you have a test in 2017 or since to prove its herpes? 

If you know it’s herpes, get another doctor. Valtrex also reduces asymptomatic shedding and protects partners- there’s zero reason a doctor (unless they’re living under a rock) wouldn’t have *ever???* prescribed this daily.  - I’m on 1gram a day just because I have frequent outbreaks even 7 years later and my doctor didn’t blink an eye.

tsqbcb,"Hey I’m in the same boat as you. When I first found out I had herpes especially since it appeared out of nowhere (had no interactions that would cause me to get infected) I was distraught, stricken, etc. I even took a week off of work to process this diagnosis. I thought my life was essentially over and didn’t have the will to live. However once the initial outbreak cleared and I got more educated on the virus itself (how common it is - oshv1 btw - and how it’s not airborne and can’t be transmissible through sharing stuff) I became more relieved and it eventually became a meh thing for me. I get that I still have that handicap when it comes to dating/sex or even the stigma that I’m “the dude with herpes”, but after dealing with the intense emotions I had after the diagnosis I came to a realization that “it is what it is” and rather than dwindle on the fact that I have it, I started looking into other areas of my life that I could improve on instead of being so focused on something I can’t. It’s unfortunate and I understand everyone’s pain, but life moves on. Things have returned to normalcy for me after the outbreak but still knowing the fact that I have herpes I now don’t really care. I also don’t really care about the idea of disclosing - I straight up tell my friends I have herpes.",2022-03-31 03:35:57,3

My biggest thing is that I know I personally can come to terms with this. But I dont know how in the world to tell sexual partners.

I have a fair amount of casual sex and really enjoy being intimate. I dont see how I can do that now or have a conversation with a guy in a bar before going home with them.

Ive read that most people have it and many dont care. If thats the case then why (in all my excapades) has nobody disclosed that to me!

To be honest I dont know how Ill date or carry on. Its sounding like I will a. never be able to have casual sex again without having a convo, which sounds impossible in a crowded bar/concert/first date. and b. will have to wear a condom until I pass away. Sorry for the detail and openness but just trying to give a picture of my current life and things I enjoy for honest input.

And I will say I specifically do not feel bad for discussing public figures. Especially the ones I listed. Jim Carey's information came to light because he gave the STDs to a young girl who died of suicide because he repeatedly gas lit her. Young NBA boi talks about it openly and honestly. G Herbo bb mama blasted him because he was treating her terribly. And lastly Usher was allegedly assaulting women which is how it came to light. So I don't feel terrible because some of them wouldn't have been on the radar if they were respectable people. And this post  is only using the public information to normalize our feelings and journey.

All these celebrities work and make huge amount of dollars in the Hollywood system that repeatedly uses people with STDs as the butt of the joke. Leading us to further stigma, isolation and all the other horrid feelings and these celebs dont give af to speak.

Maybe kill her mentally though…when I first got it, it was one of the worst pains I’ve experienced. And not having a good immune system amplified the amount of blisters I got. 

I’m on antivirals daily because the meds I take weakens my immune system. How your body suppresses the virus is entirely dependent on your immune system, and without a strong one it’s hard to stop the outbreaks. Without the antivirals I get outbreaks all over my lips. I went a couple days without them and it almost instant. I always apply lysine on my lips like it’s lip balm to help the tingles. 

I would say if you plan on being sexual condoms and start antivirals, and if you plan to eat her out dental dams. It’s not as sexy but it’s better to be safe.

Whilst creams are used in drier areas of the body, not at risk of being rubbed off by clothing moving etc. I assume its the same for topical antivirals?

tss3ym,"Outbreaks may never happen, or may be so mild they are not spotted or may takes months or even years to occur. So that's why waiting on outbreaks are not really a good way of telling if you have herpes or not. Having said that a PCR swab of an outbreak cannot be beaten and is much preferred over an IgG blood test (which can miss some infections altogether and even give false positives and cannot tell you where you have the virus) and general advice from doctors is not to bother testing unless you develop symptoms. In fact many doctors are against blood test for diagnosis altogether, instead using them in specific circumstances such as where an OB has been and gone and wasn't swabbed, and so there's a reasonable belief there that a person is infected with hsv.

As stated in the comments already, if you'd like to know your status, wait until 12 weeks after exposure and get an IgG blood test. If you have an OB before then, get it swabbed ASAP. But be aware of the igG limitations - high false negative for hsv1 and the high chance of a false positive if the index value comes back as a low positive.",2022-03-31 18:55:17,1

tss0th,"It’s the worst, mine are always inside. For me, it causes UTI-like symptoms as well as extreme pain. If you have those types of symptoms (extreme pain when peeing, increased urgency and frequency of urination) I’ve found that AZO (Phenazopyridine) is super helpful for those symptoms. Also, if it hurts to pee, it can be helpful to carry around an empty water bottle with a hole in the lid. That way when you have to pee, you can fill the bottle and spray room temp water on the affected area as you urinate in order to relieve the pain and wash away urine from the area. 

For the other symptoms (painful sores) I use lidocaine cream and I try to keep the area as dry as possible. Lidocaine helps with itching too. Moisture makes it worse for me, and excess moisture also makes the sores last longer and the itching worse. I also will ice the area. I wrap ice cubes in a paper towel, put them inside of a plastic bag, lay down, and hold that on the affected area. My outbreaks are so painful that at this point my best solution is just to take daily Valtrex. Us women draw the short end of the straw in so many ways with this virus. The guy who gave it to me said that outbreaks on his penis aren’t painful, just a bit itchy. He said it’s just like a bit of acne on his dick.

tt94gp,"When my long term partner (who gave me HSV) and I broke up, I didn’t have sex or search for it for about 9 months because of this dilemma. These are the reasons I now disclose in every circumstance: When I found out I had it I cried and was really upset for a somewhat extended period of time, especially because my first outbreak was pretty unbearable… And I don’t know who gave it to my partner and that made me angry that who ever it was didn’t have the decency to warn him (maybe they didn’t know yes yes I hear you). I wouldn’t want to do that to another person. The second reason is, what if this turns into a serious relationship and not just a casual fuck? You never know where a relationship is going to go even if you start it with no intentions of moving in that direction. If I was dating someone and then six months into us sleeping together I was either diagnosed with herpes or they decided to disclose it to me, I would be so angry and untrusting of that person. 

From my experience so far, I find it best to disclose once you’re in the bedroom and things are getting hot and heavy. Usually people don’t want to just stop there and if you explain the low risk of transmittance, esp with use of condoms/dental dams/whatever is your cup of tea, then they should understand or take the time to ask some follow up questions. Otherwise, honestly, fuck them (not literally), their loss. I have been ghosted by two people that I disclosed to with no real reason and I also think it’s because of this but there are lots of other people out there that don’t care.

Fact of the matter is that YOU are responsible for YOUR sexual health. If someone were ever to ask me for test results or my status I would absolutely disclose my HSV status. If someone is compromised enough to actually be affected by HSV1 they should absolutely be asked to see their partners test results with their own eyes. I got HSV because I wasn’t careful with my own sexual health. I never asked my partner for their test results before having sex with them and I brought this disease upon myself. Everyone needs to take responsibility for their own actions. At the end of the day, HSV is not a big deal and health professionals agree it is the social stigma that is the most dangerous point of the disease.

This sub is helpful, but it’s got a way of making you internalize HSV in a way that isn’t realistic at all.  With gHSV1 if you aren’t having constant OBs you have a good prognosis.

1. gHSV1 has a completely different pathology. It’s significantly less contagious, significantly less often. So much so that even experts on HSV consider disclosing it to be debatable/ personal choice. 

2. No one wants to put anyone through HSV, but disclosing doesn’t actually prevent that.  It can happen whether they know or not. Disclosure is about risk prevention.  HSV1 is too prevalent of a risk to avoid, and gHSV1 presents an *extremely* low risk. 

I am pro-disclosure but I think when you prioritize the *act* of disclosing so much that you can’t even assess the actual risk you present to another person (which is what makes disclosure necessary), you’ve made the diagnosis an extension of yourself.

It lacks any nuance, context, or actual scientific standing.  People with HSV1 are, by and large, living completely normal lives.

You are not worthless , you are still you and this doesnt make u any less of YOU. Yes dating will be different now, but thats not bad. Its gonna show u who actually loves u and who doesnt, because at the end of the day its just herpes. It has no other complications and it is SOOO safe , it cant cause any health issues like several other STD’s and it wont reduce ur life expectancy not even by half an hour. Okay its gonna suck everytime u get an outbreak but so what? Suck it up and move on, now its past the point of return u cant change the past. Your outbreaks will gradually decrease in number and frequency, they will heal faster with time and u will FOR
SURE find love and it wont change u. U shouldnt bring urself down because that will cause stress leading to another outbreak anyways. So just be positive its just a bump on the road, the cure is around the corner u caught it at the right time. Its gonna be a couple of years but i give it 4-5 tops and the cure will be here for sure. Be optimistic , this doesnt change u and will never do so. Stay strong and always let it out and never hold ur tears in it will make u feel better. Dont dont dont start making wrong choices in life just because of a stupid std. its just A SKIN RASH And thats all. Smile and keep ur head up honey and if u ever need anything we’re all here for u and u can text me to ask questions whenever u want or just to talk about it because i found that it made me feel better to talk with someone i EXTREMELY TRUST about it .",2022-03-31 12:30:49,4
tslfgh,"I can 100% agree. I feel so disgusting every time I remember. Literally just want to disappear. Pray EVERYDAY AND NIGHT that they soon find a cure. I have faith that it can be removed once we figure out how to wake up the entire virus including the hiding parts. I try my best to go about my day but once I remember my day is over. I could feel it draining me. 
When I first got my results I can still hear to voice of the woman telling me I was positive yet I asked myself what would I do and had a small voice in the back of my head say “just keep going” it soothed me but I just could not even breath once I found out we have yet to find a cure. I honestly hate it and I’ve been completely asymptomatic. I know once I get an outbreak I’ll be depress for the next 3-6 months. I even had a partner(my only partner) which somehow they came out negative and I couldn’t even eat before their results thinking that I gave it him. I have both Hsv 1 & 2. Had no idea till my blood test. 
I dislike the fact that most people make it seem like sunshine and rainbows because “there are worst things” but this sucks. I was completely healthy before this. 😪",2022-03-31 14:36:42,5

tslfgh,"Same here waiting results but I already know what to expect. I’ve been preparing myself for it but deep inside I feel empty. I’m not sure what kind it is but now I’m thinking about what my future holds. How difficult rejection is going to be when disclosing to potential partners. Even though it’s actually more common than we think because most are asymptomatic, there’s still a stigma around it. Sigh 😔 what can do… if you don’t mind me asking what are you symptoms and did you get an outbreak? I wanted to post a pic of my outbreak to ask for opinions of similar people who have had it but it won’t let me
Post photos. I hope you’re okay, I truly get where you’re coming from it’s been a hard week waiting for the results… but at least you know you’re not alone",2022-03-31 02:49:24,2
tslfgh,"Hey I understand the depression I was depressed for years until I finally decided enough was enough. I have been diagnosed for 10 years and have had  20+ partners since diagnosis. None of them to their knowledge have genital herpes some had cold sores. I am currently with a guy who is completely HSV negative he works at a blood lab and took a test just for shits and giggles.  He knows about my herpes I disclosed and he is completely fine with it and accepts the risks. There are plenty of people like this who do not care. Sitting around and waiting for a cure it’s silly you’re rejecting yourself before anyone even has a chance to think about it or reject you or accept you. You are putting limits on yourself before giving anyone else the opportunity to consider anything. People get rejected every day for a plethora of different reasons Sure there are people who ghosted me especially on tinder but as I talked to my friends I realized they got ghosted too and it wasn’t because of herpes it was because dating apps are cesspools in general. Dating nowadays sucks for so many reasons if you want to pin it on herpes go for it but that’s not the only reason. I was diagnosed with ghsv-1 at 19 and I thought my life was over I didn’t tell a soul cut off friends and everything because I felt so disgusting and gross. But eventually I put myself out there and had a few positive disclosure s and i began to realize that I was the one creating the stigma for myself.. The more people I told the less it weighted me down. Think of it logically friends should care because it doesn’t effect them. The only people your herpes effects are the people you are sleeping With. Friends are supposed to be your support system and if you tell them your story they should not judge you And they will learn from you And your experience. Hell you May even help a fellow herpes person out becuase if someone discloses to your friend after you teach them about herpes they will be more understanding and knowledgeable about it. But that’s up to you. I’ll attach some links that have seemed to help people and if you need anything please dm me.I’ve had it for almost a decade at this point and have a pretty good handle on it.

This first link is info about a support group I’m in. All herpes people from all over the world we all share are experiences, vent , swap info and remedies, and just talk about life it’s an awesome place to be for sure.

This is a disclosure guide with “scripts” on how to tell potential partners about herpes and what had worked for us. Mine is under Lauren. Also at the bottom it has resources about herpes to Send to partners.

https://docs.google.com/file/d/1vExi_t8aY_LzaIe7PB3DihQLW3QqJiW6/edit?usp=docslist_api&filetype=msword

This is a list of common myths about herpes and why they are wrong with cited sources. Maybe this can not only ease your mind but if a partner has questions you will have answers backed by science.

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-6oZmnfywTFNYScKYC7Mh7MXZKrA0GUcztS8Bz5bW0k/edit

This is a list of social Medias about herpes. Sometimes it does people good to see people being public about it and the amount of support they receive from strangers. The accounts are funny and informative and all herpes positive. There is everything on there from podcasts, YouTube, TikToks, blogs, Facebook support groups, Instagram pages, dating pages, subreddits, and websites.

And you didn’t mention outbreaks but I’ll add the outbreak guide I put together after talking to the support group and a bunch of redditors it’s all info how to shorten and lessen outbreaks and deal with particularly painful sores

tslfgh,"We are here w you. You def aren't alone. I know it's tough right now, but think of it this way: we/everyone/your friends is having sex. This bug doesn't care who it infects. No one is immune and it is a function of bad luck considering you didn't do anything different than anyone else. 

Did you ever speak w the guy who it came from? Was he aware? It doesn't really matter now, but at least hear his story. Maybe you can help protect other girls he will sleep w by confronting him and bringing it to his attention. 

I know it's hard, especially at 18. When I first got it in 2003 (before you were born. I know. I know. I'm old), the stats were 1 in 4 women had it. It was something like 1 in 5 guys so that just demonstrates that it is easier for girls to get it. Essentially, there are more women w it than men. And the 13% stat today only includes people 14-49. I don't get that. Does everyone only live to 49?? Lol. The reason for that is that the older one gets, the more likely they are to have caught it. 

Again, you are not alone; you have plenty of support (other H forums w others like us); count your other blessings (health; family; etc); don't let this BUG define you and if needed, go see a psychiatrist and/or therapist. I too suffer from depression and anxiety, so being on drugs for that helps in addition to therapy. 

Last thing: if the symptoms keep occuring, try to get on daily generic valtrex pills. Not only does it prevent/stop/lessen symptoms, but it almost entirely prevents transmission to another. It's almost a magic pill and I am thankful that it is available. Back in the 1970's and 80's, they didn't have really anything to fight back w. They eventually got a drug called acyclovir which is essentially just a weaker dose of valtrex. That pill had to be taken at least twice a day; valtrex just once. 

Hang in there and let us know if you need anything else.",2022-03-31 18:15:03,2

I would say to myself, if someone buys something defective, they either return it or throw it out. Why am I any different? It was engulfing me. Luckily, I found a good psychiatrist who got me on the drug Lexapro and it enabled me to stop the obsessive thoughts and at least be able to function.",2022-03-31 18:20:56,2

I found that the best way to get over it is to think of the pill as my, trusting little buddy. He protects me from OBs and prevents the spread to my partners.

tsohj3,Extremely illegal. press all the charges that you can and get a restraining order,2022-03-31 14:37:59,2
tsohj3,"He’s the ONLY one here doing anything illegal. He’s being highly abusive to you. You need to set some boundaries immediately, and if they aren’t immediately respected, it’s time to pursue an order of protection. You do NOT need to put up with this BS from him or anyone else. You need to tell him one time, and one time only before taking further action, that you will not allow him to speak to you that way, that you will NOT discuss matters that aren’t directly relevant to your child with him, and that you will not submit to his threats, and that any further communication or behavior that lies outside the scope of coparenting will result in legal action. Document everything that he says. Do not answer or in any way acknowledge any communication that isn’t relevant to your child. He’s doing this to hurt you and get a rise out of you, and any time you capitulate by acknowledging it he gets what he wants. 

What he is doing is abusive and wrong, and you cannot let him blackmail you with this. Herpes isn’t the end of the world. I know that it seems like it would be horrible if people found out, but what is more horrible than that is to continue to let your ex blackmail you and abuse you. You cannot let this continue, and if that means people find out, it’s not the end of the world, girl. 

Don’t ever for a single second think that he has the power to interfere with your future relationships based on your HSV status. There are SO MANY people out there who will love you, have sex with you, enjoy your company, and choose to be with you regardless of your status. As long as you’re disclosing, he has zero leg to stand on, and it’s none of his business. Your relationship is over - his control over you needs to be over. He doesn’t get to dictate your future relationships just because he clearly is jealous and angry. 

Whatever you do - do not allow this to go on. I know that it can be easy to fall victim to low self esteem snd self worth if you have herpes, but don’t allow it. You having a skin condition does not mean that you need to put up with abuse. You deserve the same respect, dignity, love, and kindness as anyone else. Choose it. Your herpes is totally irrelevant here, it has nothing to do with your coparenting relationship. If he has a problem with your parenting, he can take it up with a judge. Beyond that, you don’t need to put up with any of this.",2022-03-31 16:44:57,1

I’ve also blocked him and his entire family off everything and emailed him to let him know we can communicate about our child and only our child through there.

Like....he has it too, so how would he feel if you did that to him? Hopefully communicating only through email works out for you, and hopefully he respects these boundaries. If he doesn’t, there are court-approved websites and apps for co-parenting communication that can be helpful. When I left my daughters dad that’s something that my lawyer suggested to me. Best of luck, and don’t take any more shit from him ever!

tsraow,how long since youve been diagnosed? maybe talking to a therapist might help. your coworkers have no business knowing about your diagnosis anyway. you wont pass it on to them. they would have no right to judge you. you might have a lot of subconscious shame about herpes. it might help to dismantle your own internalised stigma surrounding it and realise its not that big of a deal,2022-03-31 04:14:24,2
tsdkea,Condoms do not offer total protection as HSV is spread via skin to skin contact. Any time you participate in intercourse with an infected individual you assume some risk of contracting HSV regardless of antivirals.,2022-03-30 19:33:08,7
tsdkea,">How much do meds actually lower the risk of transmission

Daily suppressive herpes medication generally lowers transmission risk by about 50% from whatever it was before.

>I (F23) have been seeing someone (M23) who disclosed they have herpes. I believe genital herpes.

It sounds like you're unclear about both the *location* of your partner's herpes infection as well as the *type* (ie whether it's hsv1 or hsv2). Both types of herpes can infect orally or genitally. The type of herpes, and the location of the infection, together determine how much of a transmission risk the infection will pose. So I would encourage you to clarify these things.

Since you suspect it's most likely a genital herpes infection that your partner has. Let's talk about more about those specifically. So, a person can have either genital hsv1 or genital hsv2. Of the two, genital hsv2 poses a higher risk of transmission. Here are the stats for male-to-female genital hsv2 transmission within the constraints stated:

-----

**Male-to-Female Ghsv2 transmission risk:**

In studies of couples in long term relationships (ie together at least 3 months already) where the man has genital hsv2 and the woman doesn't and they both know he has it, if they have *unprotected* sex for an entire year (approximately twice per week) except during outbreaks, and the man takes no herpes medication, the woman has about a 10% chance of becoming infected by the end of the year.

Having sex more or less often than twice per week would raise or lower that base figure accordingly. Also note that that base figure comes from studies of couples already in long term relationships, and herpes is slightly more likely to transmit when the partners have been together less than 3 months. We aren't sure exactly *how* much higher the risk is before the 3-month mark, but we know its definitely higher. Herpes is also known to be more active when the infection is recent, most notably during the first 6-12 months of having it (the decline is gradual).

If the man takes daily herpes medication that would lower the risk to the woman by about 50%, bringing the annual risk from about 10% down to about 5%. Furthermore, condoms have been found to provide women with a very high level of protection from herpes, though not quite complete. One recent large scale study found that condoms reduce male-to-female herpes transmission risk by a further 96%. Herpes expert Terri Warren thinks that might be a *bit* on the high side, but not by much. So consider well over a further 90% reduction. So without condoms or medication, the annual risk to the woman is about 10%. With medication it falls to about 5%. With condoms but no medication it would be about 1%. And with medication *and* condoms it's well under 1%. 

----

Again, the above is for genital hsv2. The risk posed by genital hsv1 would be several times *less*. Genital hsv1 is actually one of the least active kinds of herpes there is. Outside of an active outbreak, it poses a *very* low risk to partners -- some might say *extremely* low -- to the point that herpes experts question where there is any practical benefit to using precautions to reduce the risk further because the risk is already so low to start with.",2022-03-30 20:29:06,5
tsdkea,The study I read had people taking daily valtrex PLUS used condoms each time they had sex. And it reduced  HSV completely by 48% and if it was transmitted it was mostly asymptomatic in the person who caught it.,2022-03-30 21:09:45,5
tsdkea,Just keep using condoms man it aint worth it,2022-03-30 19:02:09,5
tsdkea,If he’s on antivirals and uses condoms it’s approximately 1% chance per year of transmission if you have sex twice a week.,2022-03-30 19:27:47,3
tsdkea,I thinks it’s like 50%,2022-03-30 19:19:45,-2
tsdkea,The risk of transmission w just daily antivirals and no OBs at the time is extremely low,2022-03-30 19:45:37,6
tsdkea,Honestly****,2022-03-30 22:47:53,2
tsdkea,"Correct. W just daily antivirals, transmission is VERY low. Adding condoms makes it even more challenging to transmit. In other words, tell him to STAY on daily valtrex. 

Additionally,herpes is spread via SKIN-TO-SKIN contact, so no issues w saliva, etc. 

Google it and go to the WebMD site for more information.",2022-03-30 19:44:16,3

tsnrrh,"IGG test results for HSV2 under 3.0 has a 50% chance of being a false positive. The chances just get higher the closer you get to 1.1. so I'd say, if youre asymptomatic, chances are you don't have herpes. Wait a month or two, and get your IGG tested again. If that number stayed the same or decreased, you can confidently say you don't have it. Doctors usually aren't aware of this.
Remember, HSV1 is usually just cold sores. 70% of the population has it. HSV2 is usually genital herpes, and that's the one you should be concerned with if you're asymptomatic.",2022-03-31 05:54:23,1

There’s shame around genital herpes because it’s tied to sex. That’s the only reason why.

hope that gives you an idea of a non positive person's logic. its not the hsv2 that we fall for or want in our lives (obviously) its the person. some people have mental disorders, addictions, physical disabilities, stds whatever, bt if a human being fucks with another human being on that level, its a compromise most people are willing to make to be with their human.",2022-04-02 14:09:59,2

tspsf4,">Can herpes be transmitted through sex toys ?

According to herpes expert Terri Warren, herpes generally can't be transmitted via inanimate objects because the virus cannot survive on them in any form viable for transmission. However, the one exception for oral herpes is shared lip products (eg lipstick, chap stick, lip gloss etc), and the one exception for genital herpes is shared sex toys (ie shared during the same sexual encounter). The nature of these products can sometimes sustain the virus for a short time so that there could potentially be a risk if another person were to use the same item very shortly after it being used by someone who might be contagious.

Here's a quote from Terri regarding genital herpes transmission via inanimate objects:

>The only objects I worry at all about are sex toys that are actively involved in a sexual encounter, going from one person’s orifices to another person’s orifices.

([Source](https://www.westoverheights.com/forum/question/risk-involved-with-this-exposure/))

Here is the standard blurb I usually pose regarding inanimate objects:

----

Herpes expert Terri Warren, who has a 35+ year career researching and treating herpes specifically, has repeatedly stressed that herpes *cannot* be transmitted via drinking straws, cups, utensils, cigarettes/joints/bongs, shared food items, or inanimate objects in general. Herpes is a very fragile virus that cannot live long outside the body and requires both moisture and warmth to survive. Also, a certain *volume* of virus is required in order to cause an infection. A small trace amount is insufficient. Terri has stated that the only inanimate objects that pose any practical risk of *oral* transmission are lipsticks / chapsticks / lip gloss because the particular properties of these items can sometimes sustain the virus for short periods and they can sometimes be used by another person immediately after someone who might be contagious. Similarly, she has stated that the only inanimate objects that pose any risk for *genital* transmission are shared sex toys that, again, might be used by another person immediately after a person who is infected. She also advises people with genital infections to not share bath towels *when they are having an outbreak*, but expects the risk of transmission in this manner to still be extremely unlikely.

Here is one such quote from Terri on her clinic forum where she addresses the issue and responds to someone asking about potential transmission from sharing a phone:

>the only inanimate objects I am at all concerned about are sex toys and lipsticks. We do advise individuals not to share warm moist towels, but even transmission in this way is extremely unlikely. The phone is not the kind of contact that transmits herpes. There has to be more contact than that. To acquire herpes, there is a certain amount of virus that need to be present and it is not a tiny amount. I guess if a person had a big cold sore and was rubbing their cold sore actively into the phone and then the next person came up immediately afterwards and started putting the phone in their mouth, there might be a 1% chance of transmission. It just doesn’t happen this way.

([Source](https://www.westoverheights.com/forum/question/mouth-outbreaks-and-transmission-through-phone-sharing/))
  
And here's another example where a client wrote:

>Scenario: My friend has large and frequent cold sores. I was visiting her for coffee and when she was making the coffees she licked and sucked the spoon she was using and then used the spoon to scoop the milk froth on top of my coffee (did not stir). She had a healing cold sore (scab had fallen off). I was worried but too polite to say anything, so waited 5 minutes before drinking my coffee trying to avoid the froth.

>The next day I woke up with a sore throat, slight sniffles and light headedness (but I also had a cold/allergies last week). My top lip felt funny but it could have been in my imagination due to being paranoid or just dry. I got Zovirax and put it on just in case.

And Terri replied:

>Someone else on here asked a similar question today but with soup instead of coffee. My answer is the same – a million to one chance that you would contract herpes in this way.

>I don’t know why medical websites say that honestly. There is just no evidence in the scientific literature to say that this is true and I’m totally a science based clinician. Perhaps it is because people go into their providers and say “I ate hot soup that my friend made who gets cold sores and now I have one”. Of course, we can’t extrapolate that because someone who has cold sores did something and now you have one, you got it from them. The only inanimate object that I worry about for transmission of oral herpes is sharing lipsticks. Lipsticks and lip gloss stay moist and if someone with active oral virus uses lipstick immediately before someone else, that is a possibility for transmission. That’s why cosmetic counters no longer allow testing with the actual lipstick and now use surrogates, like q tips.

tsohna,My igg is as negative and my igm was .1 in the equivocal range. But because I have symptoms I’m positive for herpes. Have no clue what type but even thought technically I don’t have an actual positive test I’m still going to say I have it. I’ve been feeling lost with my diagnosis and I wouldn’t want anyone to feel this way. So if you were having symptoms I would still be careful because you never know who you might give it to and how bad it could ruin a relationship if you had the knowledge of symptoms,2022-03-31 01:48:43,2
tsohna,Same boat as you. Negative IGG at 11 weeks. Negative  PCR swab of weird lesion. Now I have swollen lymph nodes in groin. Don’t know if I am going to test for a third time or not. Tough spot to be in for sure.,2022-03-31 02:16:05,2
tsohna,"The only thing left for you to do is get a Western Blot test, If you absolutely can't let it go, and have the money for a WB, then get that. If it's negative, you don't have it.",2022-03-31 06:27:37,2
tsohna,Definitely agree. We don’t get index values where I am which is annoying… I tested negative for over a year with weird symptoms and last exposure to someone new 3 months ago so don’t know what to do. I’m not rushing into anything but also don’t know when I can believe the tests and move on,2022-03-31 01:50:50,1
tsohna,How can you say you have it if you are not testing positive on igg though? Igm is not accurate. Lots of things can cause symptoms similar to herpes,2022-03-31 01:51:29,1
tsohna,"It’s difficult isn’t it? I had symptoms after an encounter in March last year but after testing negative so much, I let it go. I had 3 PCR swabs of the area too - all negative. I was with a new partner since who I disclosed to even though I was negative cause I was getting symptoms. He didn’t care cause he trusted the negatives. Last time we hooked up was January and I’m feeling weird sometimes but I haven’t had a distinct outbreak. I get internal soreness sometimes but I’ve just recovered from BV and took antibiotics. Don’t know what to do :/",2022-03-31 02:18:30,1
tsohna,"The HSV2 tests are very accurate and apparently 50% of people seroconversion after 3 weeks, 70% by 6 weeks and almost 100% by 6 months. But the 12 week mark is maximum sensitivity which we have done. Such a grey area because I don’t have textbook symptoms and it could be other things too like my doctors and specialists have told me",2022-03-31 02:19:35,1
tsohna,Thank you for your response. I would have gotten the WB if it was feasible for me but it’s too expensive and I have no job at the moment. I’m left trusting the IGg tests which still show a good indication I don’t have it but these ongoing symptoms are concerning because they’re not going away,2022-04-01 02:23:41,1
tsohna,I think an igm test shows if you are having an outbreak. And I have many symptoms of herpes minus the cluster. Although it could have been there and I missed it. But mostly I’ve been having severe itching and swelling for two weeks. And the leg numbness just tied it all together for me. The doctor said she saw where the sores were healing. And because of all of my symptoms. It just makes sense. I’m dumb as fuck because I believed someone who said they were tested. And I didn’t even ask if they had cold sores/herpes. Even though I saw a scab on their face…. It was like a big huge stop sign in my face but I still was like well I guess they told me so I have to believe them right??? And it took me so long to even consider oh shoot this is herpes… because again I was like nah they told me they were negative for everything. Meanwhile people don’t even realize a cold sore is herpes and is contagious and something you have to disclose,2022-03-31 02:09:44,2
tsohna,Yes. Tough spot to be in for sure. One doctor wouldn’t even swab because he was convinced it wasn’t herpes. I don’t know if I should keep testing or just let it go.,2022-03-31 02:26:05,2
tsohna,Yeah I read that. I got IGG blood test after 11 weeks and when I went to get a PCR last week (14 weeks post exposure) my doctor said it wouldn’t even be worth it to blood test again because my levels probably wouldn’t of changed much since my last blood test.,2022-03-31 02:27:26,2
tsohna,"It's unfortunate that it's so expensive. But you have negative PCR swabs, too, which is really convincing that whatever you have going on isn't herpes. 

I could accept that, along with the negative IgGs, and start looking at something else as the cause. 

If you've had constant symptoms, it's not likely to be herpes. I hope you find the cause. :(",2022-04-01 02:29:37,2
tsohna,I’m going to DM you if that’s okay,2022-03-31 02:10:32,2
tsohna,Really? Yeah most of them don’t even want to test us properly when we ask! I had to beg for PCR swabs. It’s like the negatives are reassuring but a part of me feels like I should disclose anyway but then again I’m negative? I don’t want to keep getting tested because it will fuel my anxiety as I’ve had like 6 igg tests the past year and I told myself enough is enough and I will drive myself into insanity if I keep going,2022-03-31 02:27:57,1
tsohna,"Yes exactly, so we’ve reached maximum sensitivity/accuracy which is a reassuring thing because we didn’t test a week after but I still have those small question marks :/",2022-03-31 02:28:53,1
tsohna,"I agree, I wish it was more easily accessible. Living internationally and having to fork out nearly $1k is unbelievable. Thank you kindly, this has been a year of hell and part of me is very worried this is something serious as if it’s not herpes, what is causing this? Nobody can work it out and I’ve seen various doctors and specialists :(",2022-04-01 02:32:08,1
tsohna,Yeah 6 is a lot. I’ve only had 1 IGG and 1 PCR. If I was you i would just chalk it up as a negative and move on!,2022-03-31 02:34:30,2
tsohna,I don't know - I don't know what your symptoms are. I hope you find answers.,2022-04-02 02:13:34,2
tsohna,Definitely need to convince myself of it. I likely have an autoimmune issue or something flaring up from stress I’ve been under the past 3 years. Would you like to DM?,2022-03-31 02:35:31,1

tsrtj4,This! Omg my ex partner who gave me ghsv from his oral HSV told me I wouldn’t let anything stop me from living life while I was depressed he was like if I had aids or herpes I would still live my life like umm sir you do have herpes that’s how I got it. Wtf,2022-03-31 05:24:34,2
tsrbpj,"my advice would be to focus on building your connection with him and stop focusing on whether he would leave you. the fact that he stayed after you disclosed just screams that he loves you and sees a future with you. dont sell him short like that. you and him both deserve a fair shot. just build your relationship with him and take the appropriate precautions to minimise the chance of spreading it to him. also the type of hsv you have might play a role in transmission rates so search up on that and it might give him some relief. im not assuming ur gender but female to male transmission is even lower, if that applies to you. honestly, just focus on being in love. in the long run as he falls more and more for you, his perspective will probably change to “i dont care if i get it, i just want to be with you”. thats the end goal for long term relationships with stds in my opinion",2022-03-31 04:21:06,3
tsrbpj,"Hey! I know exactly how you feel, I was diagnosed with HSV1 last September and when you find out it is a big shock. It’s important to remember that Herpes is so much more common than you think and this doesn’t change who you are.

tsn2xw,"I get so confused. I thought that if you have hsv either genital or oral and it’s been awhile, you get enough antibodies that’ll protect you from getting the same one in the other location.

tsn1vh,"I didn’t do a swab test as to I have no leisure’s, just the igG blood test. The symptoms I’ve had have been just a slight fever about a week and a bit later burning/ discomfort in my penis (I had chlamydia roughly 3 weeks ago so I’m hoping it’s residue from that), the test is what throws me off as I’m reading that could be a sign of a early developing infection. Regardless, just relax!! Don’t lose your mind over something that could easily be nothing, we’ll both get through this",2022-03-31 00:55:41,1
tsn1vh,"So from what I have read doing my research due to my own symptoms is that blood test can be inconclusive due to most of the population having hsv1. Hsv2 is mostly genital but hsv1 can also be in the genitals it’s mostly waist up but  it can show up in blood test but you can also be asymptomatic. I’m sorry I hope I’m not confusing you. To me it sounds like it might be residual from the chlamydia. If you do get a lesion get it swabbed asap and you will know fersure. I am loosing my mind, dating is going to be so hard if I have hsv I feel terrible 😢",2022-03-31 01:01:31,1
tsn1vh,"I do have HSV1, I’ve had it practically all my life and up until a few years ago I’d get cold sore every few months (since they’ve calmed down and I get maybe 1 a year) so maybe that is a possibility. I was on vacation and had sex with 4 sex workers in that time (not something I’m proud of), condom broke on 3 of them and I had a terrible fever upon returning so I figured I’d play it safe and get tested, what really throws me off is the fact I tested negative then a few weeks later it’s “unable to determine if antibodies are present” on the same test… regardless don’t stress your self out too much over it!! I feel like I’ve lost years of my life already stressing over this, just sit back and let life take its course, whatever happens happens. It’s not the end of the world and it’s definitely not worth losing your mind over.",2022-03-31 01:14:57,1
tsn1vh,"No judging here, it happens! And you’re great for getting tested! Some people would ignore it and continue spreading something on which is terrible. I think you tested too early, I think you need time for the antibodies to show up I would suggest you rest in about 3-5 months for HSV2 If you are positive you can know and take antivirals to lessen passing it on.

tshkwl,"I would say I had one of these cases. I had my first outbreak about a month ago, although I didn’t know it was an outbreak at the time because it was just one single sore. I had shaved against the grain, then had sex very shortly after, so I assumed this sore was just from that. It didn’t hurt to the touch or when I peed, and it looked nothing like the herpes pictures I saw online. But because I’m the type of person that gets tested every six months out of pure paranoia, I decided to schedule a full test with my OB/GYN. It came back negative for everything except HSV-2. At this point the sore was gone already so I did have to get an IGG test but the score was 10.00 so I very much have ghsv. Because my first breakout was so mild I can see why people have hsv and never know it, because my sore resembled just another ingrown hair.",2022-03-30 21:39:23,1
tshkwl,The only reason I went into the doctor was because my itching was so terrible I thought maybe I had a yeast infection. Then I was like why didn’t I think of herpes?!?! I had leg numbness which I thought was just my body from laying down. And then pains in my leg. Again probably just sore from working out or the birth control side effects. Never had cluster of bumps. Had one puss filled bump and thought it was a ingrown because I’ve gotten pus filled pimples before. Especially after sweating with a fresh shave/wax. Then it hit me that everything combined was just symptoms of herpes. I still don’t have anything but itching. Still going through my first month outbreak. I shaved because I wanted t see if I could see bumps where I was itching. Still nothing. But today I saw very very tiny puss filled sores. I have about three. One near where my underwear sits on my legs and another on the other side. Possibly irritation from underwear. And another near where I was itching. They are very tiny and so I can’t really tell they are painful until I rub my finger over a few times. They could be from shaving but now that I know I have herpes and am currently in an outbreak I’m almost positive it’s a sore.

ts8cc5,"Of course this all depends on what you are comfortable with and what you want out of your sex life (and discuss with your partner) but to me it seems pretty arbitrary for the oral sex only to be a no-go due to the HSV. For one, there are dental dams that can be used. Second of all, they’re really not any less effective than condoms at preventing transmission. This is a virus that’s transmitted through skin to skin contact, condoms do not cover all of the skin that touches during sex. All other things being equal I just don’t see a greater risk in oral sex than any other kind of sex when taking the same precautions. 

I also agree with the person who mentioned having him screened for antibodies (IgG not IgM) because that will at least tell you if he’s within the large proportion of our population that already has HSV1, at which point it won’t even matter what you do in regard to HSV1 specifically (obviously there are still other safety factors to consider when having sex with a new partner). IgG tests aren’t perfect but they can give you more info than you had before. 

And lastly to actually answer your question, my best friend for the last 15 years has had genital HSV1. Her husband of 10 years does not have it. He gives her oral sex without a dental dam frequently (yes, we talk about this kind of stuff), still has never tested positive for the virus. She takes a daily suppressant dose of valacyclovir, pays close attention to prodromal symptoms, and never has sex during an outbreak. 

Im sure you know this but just in case....while the data isn’t entirely 100% consistent, valacyclovir can reduce the number of days you are shedding virus anywhere from 50-78% (depending on the study). So lots of people choose to take the antivirals when in a situation like yours, where one partner is (presumably) not infected and does not wish to accept a higher risk of transmission. Even though it’s true that transmission rates when you don’t have an outbreak are lower, they’re definitely not zero, and most cases of HSV are spread during non-outbreak shedding since most people avoid sex anyway during an OB. Many people with GHSV1 shed virus on more than 10% of all days, some way more, and some a bit less. The meds can reduce the risk associated with this. Is this something you’ve considered? No pressure, obviously,  just throwing it out there since I know it’s worked well for people I know, it’s another tool we have available for our toolboxes.

And lastly, as someone who contracted HSV2 from an ex who waited 2.5 years into our monogamous relationship ship to tell me that he had HSV and had it for 10 years prior, I commend you for doing the right thing. I didn’t get a choice, even though I did pretty much everything right. You’re not doing that to your partner, you’re doing the right thing by giving him the autonomy for choose, and I am so happy for you that your partner has been largely accepting. Take care, and best of luck with your new relationship.",2022-03-30 19:30:26,5

I will say though that I was infected with HSV2 by someone who has been asymptomatic for years and was taking valacyclovir as a suppressant every single day. Of course he also didn’t tell me he had herpes when we had the talk about discontinuing use of condoms, so I obviously had unprotected sex with him several times a week for years which put me at higher risk, but yeah, it is still possible even with as awesome as the meds are so it’s important to be open with your partner when it comes to backup forms of protection.

In my case I’m fortunate that I do know with near certainty I wasn’t infected prior to him. I was tested (albeit with IgG screens) on three occasions before dating him, twice during pregnancy and once as a part of a comprehensive STI screen, all with no additional sexual partners in between.

There is absolutely no guarantee with either that you will have noticeable symptoms in the first 2-12 days, and not having an outbreak in this time frame is extremely common and alone says nothing discernible about virus genotype.

But, that doesn’t mean that it won’t happen. Many people don’t have a noticeable outbreak for weeks, months, or years after being infected, and then suddenly have their first noticeable outbreak of the virus. 

So no, you cannot tell your genotype based on a lack of a noticeable primary outbreak in 2-12 days of being infected. In fact the ONLY way to know your genotype is through testing. Some people will try to tell you that HSV1 is only oral and HSV2 is only genital, or that they can tell by looking at the sores, or the severity of the outbreak, or other factors like this. While there are general patterns, they often change, and aside from genotyping you can’t rely on anything to tell you this information. For example, genital HSV1 infection has been on the rise for years, even though people still consider it the “oral” herpes, and even medical professionals sometimes pass on these myths. The ONLY way to know for sure is through testing, nobody here can tell you your genotype unfortunately, or if and when you’ll have an outbreak.",2022-03-30 20:11:54,1
tsacdo,"Interesting thank you for this. My note is more in relation to the fact that so many people in this sub are getting a true primary outbreak when they get diagnosed with GHSV1 within the 2-12 days. 

Mean while a lot of GHSV2s are experiencing mild symptoms, constipation, small rash etc. it looks like a very majority of them actually with little to no Ghsv1s going through the same thing.",2022-03-30 22:51:59,1

tsd8gz,It's spread by skin to skin contact. You're fine. Saliva is inconsequential.,2022-03-30 19:54:07,1
tsd8gz,I (F) had burning and itching and would swell from itching. I had cuts possibly from itching but I guess sores come in forms of cuts as well. I had leg numbness and a mucousy cough. Also sneezing. Not sure if it was allergy related. I never had any clusters. Just itchy bumps that looked like razor bumps. And 20+ days later I have about three super super small white bumps. Not clustered. And in different spots of my vulva. I believe it was from oral sex. But as of right now I can’t find out the type because I didn’t have any sores to swab and blood test was too early to detect. So I would have to wait for the person to get tested since they told me they didn’t know they had anything…,2022-03-31 01:40:24,1
tsd8gz,If u don’t mind me asking what’s the main thing that makes u think it something else from what I’ve said. The fact that it’s been over 2months.? Also no sores but itchiness and redness in that region also feel like my skin is lighter now between my legs and started to spread to testicles a little ( the lightness is weird since I’m a black man and the rest of my legs are dark. More like a shiny gloss when skin is peeling sort of ),2022-03-30 19:05:44,1

tsd8gz,I’m sorry to hear that. I can understand the pain of not knowing. I’ve been using some steroid and anti fungal creams have u tried anything on your cuts. I felt the same thing I was in the shower and put soap on the cut and it burned like crazy and then the itchiness spread to the whole groin and buttocks area.,2022-03-31 17:13:23,2

Test Now.",2022-03-30 21:17:19,1
tsd8gz,We’ll for me someone told me if anti fungal cures it then it wasn’t herpes. The area is still kind of peeling I’m a black man and the area skin is peeling is turning glossy/grey/light coloured. Itchiness comes and goes for like literally only ten seconds. Here’s to hoping I didn’t get anything. Finally found a clinic willing to test but idk if they will test for herpes since it might not show up in blood (end of January is when I had encounter). But I just wanna know I’m a serious ovwrthinker. If I’m good I will never take risks like that again,2022-04-01 15:20:43,1
tsd8gz,If the test is available and is not too expensive for you then I would get one now to ease your anxiety. But it is possible that nothing will show up because it’s too early. Or could be you are negative. It’s better if you have a sore and are able to swab it so keep an eye out for that. I’m so sorry you are having anxiety over this. I remember how scared I was.,2022-04-01 15:25:10,1
tsd8gz,No sores at all. What seemed like a tiny cut between my scrotum and leg that’s since went away after polysporin one to two night use. But the itchiness is like jock itch (which I’ve had many many time) on STEROIDS. Anti fungal seems to be helping as itching is Greatly reduced but the two areas in the overlap of my scrotum are the only problem areas left,2022-04-01 15:40:53,1
tsd8gz,And how long is safe to blood test for herpes when it should show up if u have it. It will be three months soon,2022-04-01 15:41:49,1
tsd8gz,I heard 12 weeks (3 months) after exposure is the ideal time to get a blood test. I got a blood test about 3/4 weeks after exposure and I only had numbers for the Igm test which I think tests for current outbreak or recent infection,2022-04-01 17:07:35,1

I feel for y’all and hope things get better, I promise it’s not the end of the world. Yes she should have been informed but if you didn’t know then you didn’t know, you can’t help that so don’t beat yourself up.

Of course first they tested me for infections and when nothing else was found and I still had the symptoms I was told Vulvodynia. For male n female it could also be PFD tight pelvic muscles that can tighten after infections in the genital area among other things etc … 

Unfortunately not a lot of doctors are educated on this just like HSV so we get screwed all the way around yay us but you have to find doctors that specialize in vulvar pain or sexual dysfunction etc .

ts8961,">Is it normal to have prodrome 24/7 Like literally I get shooting and stabbing pain every minute. 

You didn't say where, or how large an area, is experiencing these sensations. Regardless, first, herpes prodrome does not consist of ""shooting and stabbing pain"". That is not herpes prodrome. Herpes prodrome is not that acute. It is generally a milder sensation, and is highly localized to the specific area where a herpes lesion is about to form.

Second, you said you're experiencing these sensations 24/7 but didn't say how long this has been going on for. Herpes prodrome *can* be fairly constant. But it usually doesn't last for more than a day or two, or less, before an actual herpes lesion occurs and the prodrome ends. Prodrome lasting more than a few days would be highly unusual sensations lasting that long would dramatically increase the odds that it isn't actually herpes prodrome but something else.

But again, regardless of how long these symptoms have been present, it is highly unlikely to be herpes prodrome in the first place due to the intensity of symptoms you described.",2022-03-30 19:34:08,2

i did stop taking them after my inital OB and the shooting pain got a lot worse. i also dont want to take them long term, but i dont think short term use is more harmful than pain---at least for me. its possible your body just needs a little help to adjust and you can quit them down the road. have you looked into supplements? some people swear by lysine, red marine algae, and propolis.

Any time your immune system is busy trying to fight of a cold or anything thing really you are more likely to have an OB. The first 3-6 months after a primary OB your immune system is creating antibodies and until it has high enough levels it can’t suppress the virus. So your still in the thick of it.

trwtd2,"Been taking mine because bought too many. Never noticed any difference on them. Mine are also huge (well everyone that has seen me take them said that) but I don't really care tbh. I swallow all of my supplements in one go including this and don't have a problem with swallowing them. 

Btw to make it easier to swallow tablets my trick is to put water in your mouth first. Then tilt your head backwards and drop your tablets into your mouth and when swallowing tilt it backwards too as you're swallowing. Never had a problem doing it this way.",2022-03-30 19:39:56,2

Another downside is ever since taking the lysine daily, I can’t orgasm anymore",2022-04-02 20:09:11,1

ts09lm,"hi! i’m a brazilian waxer, wondering if it’s in a place where an ingrown could happen? super common with waxing. Also wondering what kind of wax it was, it could be an allergic reaction! As the above commenter said, swab to be sure! :) edit: typo",2022-03-30 07:12:25,4
ts09lm,"This is called autoannoculation. This CAN happen but it is only likely  to happen during your primary outbreak or rarely during an outbreak. After your primary outbreak your body builds up antibodies to herpes meaning that it is not only harder to catch the same herpes strain from others but also from yourself. So the longer you have herpes the less likely you are to re-catch it in a different area. When you are having an outbreak is when you are the most contagious in general, to play it safe make sure to wash your hands after touching a herpes sore with soap and water. (Simple warm water and bathroom soap kills the herpes virus no need for harsh chemicals)

But if possible always good to get a swab to confirm.",2022-03-30 06:52:33,2

trzwwn,"Hsv1 is extremely common, more than half the world has it. Lots of people do and do not even realize, just like yourself. Cases of hsv1 on genitals are increasing because of this. Honestly, if she didn’t get it from you it’s highly likely she would get it or oral hsv1 within time from someone else. I bet you both have been with people before that had it too and didn’t even know. If you two have a connection and have love , why ruin that over something you cannot change/ hard to avoid anyways? It’s best to have support during it as well. Especially in the beginning of your diagnosis. I think once you both realize the stats and number and see how common it really is you will move past it. It’s not the end of the world and definitely shouldn’t be the end of a relationship ❤️",2022-03-30 06:20:24,5

Better!I have been diagnosed for 10 years and have had  20+ partners since diagnosis. None of them to their knowledge have genital herpes some had cold sores. I am currently with a guy who is completely HSV negative he works at a blood lab and took a test just for shits and giggles.  He knows about my herpes I disclosed and he is completely fine with it and accepts the risks. There are plenty of people like this who do not care. I’ll attach some links that have seemed to help people and if you need anything please dm me.I’ve had it for almost a decade at this point and have a pretty good handle on it.


This first link is info about a support group I’m in. All herpes people from all over the world we all share are experiences, vent , swap info and remedies, and just talk about life it’s an awesome place to be for sure.

This is a list of social Medias about herpes. Sometimes it does people good to see people being public about it and the amount of support they receive from strangers. The accounts are funny and informative and all herpes positive. These is everything on there bfrom podcasts, YouTube, TikToks, blogs, Facebook support groups, Instagram pages, dating pages, subreddits, and websites. Look

Type 1 they said I had likely had it since I was a child which I had already assumed cuz I’ve had cold sores on my lips before. I didn’t get another physical exam either. They were basically like if you get another outbreak call us and we’ll prescribe meds. The desitin seemed to be the thing that cleared everything up the most. I feel almost normal now, still using the desitin cream but it looks so much better. I’m basically waiting to see if I have a second outbreak at this point so I can get a swab.

Edit: also the antivirals didn’t seem to do anything quite honestly. I still took them and finished them but they didn’t help one bit. The desitin cream seemed to be the real life saver honestly.",2022-04-07 14:28:28,2

trzb8v,My experience was very similar. Standard std panels do not include herpes tests. Unfortunately you have to ask for those and most places encourage you not to unless you are showing symptoms or have an outbreak. I’d get in as soon as you can and get a hsv SWAB. That will give you the results you need. Blood tests can give you false results sometimes but swabs will not give false positives .

I’m at the point now where it doesn’t even bother me. I literally get one outbreak a year, maybe 2 if I’m really stressed about something. So in 3 years I’ve had 3-4 outbreaks. I know I’m probably on the luckier spectrum, but I also know people who are asymptomatic and also people who take medicine if they deal with constant outbreaks. When you really read the facts on herpes it’s not life threatening (in almost all cases) and most people who have it don’t experience THAT bad of outbreaks. Again everyone is different. Also, majority of the population has some form of herpes, but how many of those people know they do? Look at it in a positive way, at least you KNOW you have it so you can practice safe sex.

trucya,"In your next relationship or sexual encounter, maybe you should both get tested for everything before getting sexually involved. It’s all about being given the choice once you know you are positive. Knowledge is power.",2022-03-30 02:38:44,6
trucya,"Oh yeah and one thing to add to the discussion. If you test positive for a herpes igg test and are between a 1.0 and 3.0 there's about a 50/50 chance you're negative. The closer you are to 1, the higher the chance you're negative. If you get a score below 3.0, you get to take the western blot to find out if you're negative or positive. That's about $400+. 

The doctors hate testing people because so many people get a false positive and then they often exclusively date only people with herpes. Then they wind actually getting herpes when they never had it in the first place. This is why doctors hate testing people.",2022-03-30 02:16:15,2
trucya,"Please get tested. You may not get any symptoms but you may pass it on to someone down the track that you care about and they might be the type to suffer from constant outbreaks, and for some of us it can be debilitating pain. Please don’t do that to someone you love, please find out so you can give them the choice. 
I caught it from my partner, I love him dearly and glad he was honest with me but some days I cant even walk from the pain, but I know it was my choice it’s not on him, if I found out he may have had an idea he had it and didn’t tell me I would never forgive him.",2022-03-30 10:38:40,2
trucya,Not getting tested is so wild to me and the people that support not getting tested are truly insane. I’m assuming the majority of the people here did not know that their partner had herpes. I’m sure their partner was “asymptomatic” and gave the disease to someone else. That’s what happened to me and now I’m over here suffering. So crazy and selfish.,2022-03-30 19:00:22,2
trucya,"Most of the time even if you get tested for “everything” they don’t test for HSV unless you specifically request it bc of a certain situation like symptoms or being exposed in some way … so most likely any future potential partners are not even gonna know to ask u to be tested specially for HSV or know any of that which is what happened with most of us on here !!! I always got tested for “everything” and asked my partner to do the same but little did we know HSV was never included . 

Im sorry but it’s ppl like you that gave HSV to people like us and now WE do have to deal with knowing, the stigma or even having frequent OBs all bc ur too selfish to try and at least find out since ur ex literally tested positive so you were exposed for a few years so you can take the proper precautions get on daily Valtrex and spare someone innocent that might come into ur life !!! If the test is negative or inconclusive at least u Can say u tried… n that’s that , but Ur reasoning is just fucked up and selfish!!! 

I wish everyday the damn testing was mandatory for all but specially for those primarily exposed n I wish they could really perfect these tests to give more accurate results !!! 

Hope you really think about what ur doing and you come to ur senses.",2022-03-31 01:04:10,2
trucya,"Thanks for the responses. After looking around this sight I decided not to get tested. The amount of depressed and suicidal people on here who don't even have symptoms is mind boggling. I can't have that. Its like a positive test turns people insane.

trucya,"100 percent. The moral instinct is to spare others the unpleasantness, but then the onus is never having a spontaneous sexual encounter ever again. I grapple with it and it's absolute hell.

trucya,See that’s the confusing part because I got a neg swab test but a positive blood.,2022-03-30 12:25:29,2
trucya,"Right. I tend to agree. But the consensus on here seems to be that everyone should allllllllways be aware if they have it. 

It really is a weird situation. 80-90% don’t know they have it. Going around living life normally. But some are told they must find out if they have it. Even if they have no obvious symptoms. 

Idk what would help take the stigma away though. Having more people test to find out they have it. So we realize how common it is. Or to go on with out constantly checking. And not worry about it.

Like eventually one will realize they have it if they pass it on to a partner. Idk what to do for my self honestly. Was negative at 5 weeks.  Dunno if I should test again.",2022-03-30 05:02:53,1

I’m just saying if you were with him for 3 years, you more likely than not have it, if you don’t that’s great but purposely not getting tested Bc you dont wanna know is just like getting tested and ignoring your diagnosis.

troqhc,"Ooof I am 100% in his position. Met a girl about 2 months ago, we connected REALLY quickly, hit it off very fast, had amazing communication and such long and deep conversations. Before her, I was single for 5-6 years and never had sex during that time. I had an extremely toxic relationship with someone that really messed me up emotionally and mentally and needed to find myself, learn to love myself again and whatnot. Anywho, the girl that I had just recently had a relationship with and I started to get sexual about a month ago after several amazing dates. We spent a weekend together at her place because we both had it off from work. Definitely had quite a bit of sex and then that Monday rolled around and she texted me telling me that she wasn't feeling good and was having flu-like symptoms and was extremely sore down there. We both just kinda thought it was from sleeping together quite a bit and having somewhat rougher sex. I got home to get ready for work, took a shower and started to notice 8-10 bumps that looked very similar to razer burn or ingrown hairs around my pubic region. The bumps were raised around the hair follicles. They really weren't painful at all and had no white heads, they were pretty far from one another and weren't bunched up. I did some google searching to see what it could be and saw that it really didn't look like herpes and looked way more similar to folliculitis. My dumbass just kinda shrugged it off and assumed maybe it was from the sex, we both were freshly shaved so maybe the friction was causing this and was going to give it a day or two to see how things healed. She went and got a COVID test for the flu-like symptoms and that came up negative. She then went to Emergicare because it started to hurt when she peed and was super painful for her to sit. Few hours passed and she sent me a text as soon as I got off from work saying we need to talk and if she can call me.

She called and told me that the Emergicare doctor said that she had a herpes outbreak going on down there. She said that she recently got tested a few months back ( not sure if she asked for an HSV test at that time ) but said she was completely negative for everything that they tested for and that I needed to go and get checked out immediately because I was her only sexual partner since her last test. She told me that she needed some time to think and talk with her sister, I apologized several times and told her that I had no idea, had never had any cold sores around my mouth or anywhere down there. I never once put the blame on her or said she could have been the one to have it first. I called the closest emergicare, they were closing in 10 mins and told me to come in the next day. My dumbass decided to go to the ER because I had really no knowledge of HSV and was in complete panic. I went, got visually diagnosed by the ER doctor and she told me it definitely looked like herpes and that they don't do the HSV blood tests and that would have to get done by a general practitioner. Left and paid $2000 ( the bill would have been $8000 without healthcare ) I texted her as soon as I got out and told her what the doc said. She never texted me back that night. I talked with family members that night for a couple of hours, did A TON of research and ended up not sleeping at all. Watched tons of YouTube videos, browsed reddit for hours and clicked on just about every google link out there that had 'HSV' in it. I am a firm believer that knowledge is power and doing the research and figured out that it's not life threatening, learned about the stigmas, found out that many people get the flu-like symptoms when they get their first outbreak and found out about how people can have it for years and be asymptomatic and then pass it along through viral shedding without an active OB. I got tested back in 2019 when I had an appendicitis, they did bloodwork and a urinalysis to make sure I didn't have any STDs and all came back negative, but I have no idea if they tested her HSV since it's usually something that needs to be asked for.

I was truly devastated. I felt beyond awful for passing this along to someone that I truly cared so deeply for, I was extremely scared and had a pretty bad mental/emotional breakdown. Things were going so great and so unbelievably amazing with her and I and then this happens. At that point I didn't even really care that I had it, I cared so much more that I most likely passed it along to her. Like I truly absolutely wished that I would have known so I could have disclosed to her, taken the daily anti-viral suppressants and done everything in my possible power to not spread the virus to her if she wanted to continue with the relationship post disclosure. There's so much regret, so much self-disappointment.. like I honestly could have seen myself falling in love with this girl because of how quick we connected and had such similar interests and I just felt broken and defeated. I never really even mourned for myself, anytime I would talk to friends or family members she would constantly be the one I talked about. My mom had to stop me one time and ask, "" But how are you doing? Are you alright? ""

The next day I called off from work, called the doctor's office as soon as they opened and scheduled an appointment with a doctor who wasn't my usual doctor because he was booked. Went to the appointment and the doctor really wasn't much help. She wasn't very informative, didn't really seem to care and just told me to use condoms which I knew wouldn't help. Gave me ani-virals and she didn't even want to see the lesions or culture test me and just told me to come back at the start of April and get blood work. I was pretty furious. Got home, texted her the results, checked social media and found out that she had removed our relationship status, removed and blocked me from all social medias. That was what broke me and sent me in quite the downward spiral, I texted her to see what was up and and a few hours later she said responded and said she is depressed, in a ton of pain, wasn't sure if she would ever forgive me for the pain I caused her and just needs time. A week went by and I texted her a few times asking her how she's doing, if I could do anything for her like grab some groceries, walk her dog for her, grab her food, come over and just chat or even do chores for her and whatnot around her place and didn't hear anything back.

She finally texted me and said she was in a terrible place, was unable to go to work for 2 weeks, was depressed and somewhat suicidal, was going to see a therapist and was afraid she might have to quit her kitchen job that she loves very much because working in a kitchen it's hard to stay dry and not sweat which can cause OBs. We texted for a good 2-3 hours and then finally I just never got a text back. It's been 2 weeks since then, still nothing. So I've basically come to the realization that it's most likely over, she is probably very upset with me even though I had no idea and wouldn't have wished this upon my worst enemy let alone someone that I had such crazy feelings for. Like you, she left me on read numerous and has ghosted me and I feel I have done everything in my power to be there for her, the ball is in her court and I am stubborn as well and she can text me at this point if she wants to because there's just not much more I feel that I can do. Honestly, losing someone that I got so close with so quickly was just absolutely heart wrenching, hurt way more than the diagnosis and makes me feel beyond terrible. I wish I could have helped, I wish she would talk to me because my anxiety and overthinking gets the best of me here and there. This past week has been much better though, I started a gym membership and started working out everyday for an hour two to get my mind a little straight. I've been eating better foods and things that are high in lysine and low in arginine. Taking daily supplements such as Zinc, Red Marine Algae and L-Lysine. Definitely nervous for this Friday because that is when I get my blood work done. Downloaded some motivation and daily affirmation apps to remind myself that I am not a horrible or terrible person and that life moves on, herpes is not the end of anything. It's just a minor speed hump in the road and I need to do everything in my power to not let it take control of my life.

I apologize for the book and I am sorry that he is ghosting you at the moment, it feels awful and re-opens the wound quite a bit when you go a day not getting a message back. I just don't get why someone wouldn't want to talk with someone else who is going through the same exact thing to talk it out, figure out triggers or have someone there to back you up and support you during this stressful ass time. He probably feels awful, feels like he let you down and is going through depression pretty hard. I hope he comes back around for you but at the same time if you need to begin your personal healing process you do that! Everyone copes differently, seems like you and I have coped a little more in a mature way. The way I see it, I have it. It happened. It sucks.. but I am not going to let this control my life, I am not going to let the 'what ifs' win and I am not going to let it manifest myself into a deep dark depression. I just want to continue with life, continue working on becoming the best person that that I can and keep pushing for my hopes and dreams.",2022-03-30 05:11:31,5
troqhc,"I will say I'm in his position... and idk what to do.. I honestly didn't know because I didn't have a full on first outbreak when I got it. AND even though I requested to be tested for everything my gyno neglected to explain that hsv wasn't included in everything. 

I would reach out to him, if you want to potentially keep seeing if there is a relationship, because in our head we are racked with guilt over the position we put you in, doesn't matter if we knew or not in our heads. I have guilt because i should have known i wasn't being tested, or i should have been more responsible with who i slept with..i feel guilty because i wasnt able to give him the choice of making an informed decision... the same choice that wasn't given to me (though I'm 99% certain the person who so kindly shared with me knew) but at the end of the day we also took your choice away

trar7q,"Hey I understand the depression I was depressed for years until I finally decided enough was enough. I have been diagnosed for 10 years and have had  20+ partners since diagnosis. None of them to their knowledge have genital herpes some had cold sores. I am currently with a guy who is completely HSV negative he works at a blood lab and took a test just for shits and giggles.  He knows about my herpes I disclosed and he is completely fine with it and accepts the risks. There are plenty of people like this who do not care. Sitting around and waiting for a cure it’s silly you’re rejecting yourself before anyone even has a chance to think about it or reject you or accept you. You are putting limits on yourself before giving anyone else the opportunity to consider anything. People get rejected every day for a plethora of different reasons Sure there are people who ghosted me especially on tinder but as I talked to my friends I realized they got ghosted too and it wasn’t because of herpes it was because dating apps are cesspools in general. Dating nowadays sucks for so many reasons if you want to pin it on herpes go for it but that’s not the only reason. I was diagnosed with ghsv-1 at 19 and I thought my life was over I didn’t tell a soul cut off friends and everything because I felt so disgusting and gross. But eventually I put myself out there and had a few positive disclosure s and i began to realize that I was the one creating the stigma for myself.. The more people I told the less it weighted me down. Think of it logically friends should care because it doesn’t effect them. The only people your herpes effects are the people you are sleeping With. Friends are supposed to be your support system and if you tell them your story they should not judge you And they will learn from you And your experience. Hell you May even help a fellow herpes person out becuase if someone discloses to your friend after you teach them about herpes they will be more understanding and knowledgeable about it. But that’s up to you. I’ll attach some links that have seemed to help people and if you need anything please dm me.I’ve had it for almost a decade at this point and have a pretty good handle on it.

This first link is info about a support group I’m in. All herpes people from all over the world we all share are experiences, vent , swap info and remedies, and just talk about life it’s an awesome place to be for sure.

This is a list of social Medias about herpes. Sometimes it does people good to see people being public about it and the amount of support they receive from strangers. The accounts are funny and informative and all herpes positive. There is everything on there from podcasts, YouTube, TikToks, blogs, Facebook support groups, Instagram pages, dating pages, subreddits, and websites.

trar7q,At the end of the day it's just a skin condition. Just let it go. I was in your shoes months ago. But I work through it. I don't care about it.,2022-03-30 01:30:53,0
trar7q,8 months in and no second ob and these old saws still hit exactly 0%.,2022-03-29 21:55:32,0
trar7q,Im glad for u,2022-03-30 01:53:46,0
trvvhi,"I would still wait to see her to see if you have a connection irl. I would avoid the first time meeting somewhere where it’s easier to become intimate, I know there’s going to be tension. But just feel it out first. 

At the end of the day, you were going there before anything started with her right? It’s just a matter of circumstance. You have nothing to lose by telling her and seeing what happens.",2022-03-30 03:54:41,2
trnjhq,it probably was a very small outbreak. are you sure you read the test results correctly? why did you decide to go to the doctor with no symptoms? just curious,2022-03-30 01:20:44,1
trnjhq,"So the swab was positive? They are almost never false positive. Sorry.
Unless there was a lab mix up. If they are positive they are almost definitive.
(Can give false negetive)",2022-03-30 04:47:17,1
trnjhq,"I normally tell others in this sub to under no circumstances get bloods taken for herpes. But, since you already have a positive swab, you have everything to gain and nothing to lose with bloods.
Your future out breaks may be similar, worse or less. Typically I would say similar or less. 
Don’t stress until after blood results",2022-03-30 07:54:04,1
trnjhq,I was going for my annual sti check up. The results said positive hsv2. Sorry if this is a silly question but can initial outbreaks be that small?,2022-03-30 02:12:37,1
trnjhq,Thank you for your response. Yes the swab was positive. Was expecting bumps and ulcers etc and not a tear. And based on the doctors shock when I went for my follow up he was utterly confused and shocked that it came back positive and told me to go on with my life until I have symptoms but that didn’t sit well with me,2022-03-30 06:43:00,1
trnjhq,Thank you so much. I will wait for the blood tests and respond back when I have the igg levels. Appreciate the sharing of info 🙏,2022-03-30 12:56:38,1
trnjhq,did they do a blood test? it might have been a reoccurrence and not your first outbreak like you could’ve had this for a while but just now found out,2022-03-30 03:12:05,1
trnjhq,I’ve heard that being called paper cut herpes before. Seems like an uncommon but certainly not unheard of presentation,2022-03-30 07:03:55,1
trnjhq,Even with no symptoms any other time? Had a blood test done today. Waiting for the results. If igg numbers are high does that mean I’ve had it for a while ? Or can numbers be low and still mean I have had it for a while ? Thank you for responding to my question. Google has sent me into a rabbit hole and appreciate info from ppl who either have it or are more knowledgeable on this topic. So thank you!,2022-03-30 03:45:04,1
trnjhq,no worries at all!! so typically a higher igg number will say you’ve had it for at least 3 months. a lower igg number is possible even if it’s an old infection but that’s rare. have you had sex with anyone recently that you think could’ve given it to you?,2022-03-30 04:39:02,1
trnjhq,"My last two parters were tested both negative and before that I was not sexually active for, 4 years had a baby so I know I was tested then for herpes. so it’s just all odd to me. Sorry, another question if you don’t mind… if that was an outbreak and it was so minor… would that be a good indication that if I was going to have future outbreaks that they would be similar to that or less then ? In a bit of a panic, constantly checking for bumps and scared I’m going to accidentally trigger an outbreak due to food, drinking etc.",2022-03-30 06:39:33,1
trnjhq,"most times when std testing is done, they don’t test for hsv, so i assume all those times it wasn’t done unless you look for what was tested and see it was. i assume your future outbreaks will probably be very light and unnoticeable. will you let me know the results of your blood test?",2022-03-30 15:03:31,1
trnjhq,Thank you for that share of opinion. I will absolutely let you know. Would it be ok to PM you when I do receive it? Especially for potential other questions?,2022-03-30 15:12:12,1
trnjhq,yeah you totally can dm me!! did they say how long it will take for your results?,2022-03-30 15:39:00,1
trnjhq,Thursday by the latest is what I was told. Here’s hoping it’s earlier!,2022-03-30 16:52:57,1

truryc,"you’re not alone. the health anxiety is a real issue for a lot of folks post-HSV-diagnosis. i’m fixated on every little symptom i have or think i have, its been 2 months since my ghsv1 diagnosis. the hand-washing has also become repetitive. maybe its overcompensating or self-guilt. this aspect of HSV will just take time, counseling, healing, and being merciful toward yourself 🙏🏼",2022-03-30 02:39:44,2
truryc,"Get another HIV test. If it's negative after all these months, you can stop worrying about that, at least.",2022-03-30 01:22:59,1
truryc,"Yep. That was the case for me too. I got tested 3 times. It’s gonna be ok. You don’t have HIV. If you did, you’d know by now",2022-03-30 01:48:18,1
truryc,I have the same fear since I keep seeing info on how people with HSV are more likely to catch HIV faster cause of the virus so I make sure to get checked annually for HIV. Although I keep reading it’s more correlated to HSV2 than HSV1 at higher risk for HIV. Idk what the difference would be….It’s just the OCD that comes with the diagnosis.,2022-03-31 01:32:18,1
tru8d8,"I had back to back outbreaks when I first got hsv2, seemingly on top of each other, but then I realized I also had bacterial vaginosis. Once I cleared that up, my outbreaks stopped.

In a previous post, you mention a positive IgM, but not a positive IgG. Have you been tested again? Do you know if you have herpes? The IgM is a terribly unreliable test. 

I'd make sure you don't have something like BV or yeast happening, and if you don't know for sure, get an IgG test done. If your doc won't do it, you can get it done at [healthlabs.com](https://healthlabs.com), [stdcheck.com](https://stdcheck.com) and [letsgetchecked.com](https://letsgetchecked.com), among others.",2022-03-30 01:28:56,1

tru8d8,"What was your index value? Was it above 3.5?

When you go to the gyno, get tested for yeast, BV, and other STDs. I hope they figure it out.",2022-03-30 09:33:50,1

trjcfy,"I am having the same thing, although I have never been diagnosed with HSV2. Bad outbreak on the left side of my face. Swollen glands and tonsils, can barely eat. My doctor said it could be transferred from something (not necessarily a direct kiss) also that it’s possible I’ve had it since childhood and have not experienced a bad outbreak. She did say it’s possible to transfer it to other areas of my body, so when I apply my creams use a q-tip and wash my hands immediately. Maybe you transferred it to yourself? 

This is some of the worst pain I have had in my life. Everything hurts.",2022-03-29 22:41:05,1
trjcfy,"That’s so crazy! I’m sorry you’re going through this ☹️ but it definitely does get less severe with time!

I don’t think that I transferred it to a new area, just because I haven’t had a normal outbreak in almost two years. It’s all just so confusing! But that’s definitely a possibility maybe previously and now it’s just now flaring up? So weird",2022-03-29 23:04:40,1
tr0t0c,"I've had 2 successful disclosures. The most recent, my current s.o. is a really great guy and I think maturity has to do with it. The first one, real nice guy and we were friends before dating so I had kinda already talked about it with him because of the guy I was seeing before him.

So I guess it would be maturity and caring people would be what made them successful?",2022-03-29 18:43:28,7
tr0t0c,Honestly at this point I’ve had more successful disclosures than not - it really has to do with the maturity level. Guys in their late 20s and older seem to have no problem with it at all. Someone I told recently was like “Doesn’t everyone have herpes???”,2022-03-30 13:20:16,4
tr0t0c,I will say I disclosed to an ex partner and he said “it’s not a big deal I have it too.” I didn’t get it from him when we were together a long time ago but that alone made me feel better cause I know he has a lot of sex.,2022-03-29 15:07:26,4
tr0t0c,Remind me in 2days!,2022-03-29 15:00:22,2
tr0t0c,"I’m not sure what characteristics to look for. 

I’ve had two positive disclosures so far. A guy I would hook up with time to time wanted to meet and he was trying to have sex. I told him I can’t do that right now. I think he may have thought I was on my period lol because he said let me know when you can have sex. I took a deep breath and I said well the reason I can’t is because I have genital herpes. He’s older than me has more life experience and knew all about it. He even made me feel like it’s not a big deal. It’s a big deal to me. Anyways, I didn’t text him or anything after because maybe he was just being polite. Well he ended up hitting me up again. 

The second disclosure I met a guy off of tinder and we were hanging out. I think it was the third time we hung out we were talking about relationships and stuff. For some reason in my head I thought this is the perfect opportunity to disclose because I was feeling sexual tension with him. I asked him would you date someone that has a disease? He said it depends what kind of disease if it will kill you or not. 
I said not life threatening. He brought up herpes and as he was talking about how it isn’t a life threatening disease I couldn’t stop smiling because I have this secret. I then blurred out “I have herpes”. He wasn’t phased by it at all. I felt the weight float off of my chest it was a crazy feeling. After we separated that night I had high anxiety of being ghosted. He didn’t ghost me he didn’t treat me any different he sent me a text the next day asking what are we going to do today. 

Now both times I was tipsy I haven’t disclosed sober yet. Right after I told both people I could feel myself being numb like my body and mind already had it’s defense prepared. It’s a crazy feeling. Sorry for the long post but I know how it is to come on this Reddit for answers. I think even reading others posts helped me start disclosing to people. 

Best of luck to you <3",2022-03-30 08:34:47,2
tr0t0c,"I think being open minded, educated and the bond you have with the person is an indicator if it will go well. Prior to my successful disclosure with my current partner, he had already helped take care of me post major surgery, I’m talking helped me brush my teeth, fed me, I was nearly immobile from surgery for six weeks, he woke up Literally every hour and slept on my couch to keep my pain medication pump flowing (had to push a button on the pump every hour for the dose). I have HSV2 so we only kissed prior to disclosure. I knew after that, he would be open. He was fully aware of how common HSV is before I told him which I figured he would know and he never judges anyone. FYI I’ve noticed if you say cold sore versus herpes people really don’t freak out and it’s not lying. You’re literally just not using the word with the stigma. All I said was I have the HSV strain that causes a cold sore/minor skin rash that shows up below my waistline (my initial OB was on my bikini line). I’ve only had the one initial OB so far and am on suppression therapy so the risk is relatively low plus female to make transmission is a lot lower. When I tried to drop the stats he just cut me off and said he was so relieved I wasn’t breaking up with him because I was too scared to disclose. Then he said he figured he will eventually get it since it’s so prevalent. Good luck. I was terrified and in total depression when I found out I had it, thinking I would never date again. After a few months of research I accepted it and just said fuck it I’m not going to be ashamed of this anymore. It’s not life threatening it’s just annoying. Ive has shingles outbreaks before and honestly that pain and annoyance is worse than HSV. And the surgery I had changed my outlook HSV is the last thing on my mind.",2022-03-29 22:00:14,1
tr0t0c,Maturity and willingness to learn about HSV have been the common denominator for me. It’s important to be very thorough in your disclosure atleast that’s how I’ve been and have had a good success with the process with different partners.,2022-03-30 00:55:30,1
tr0t0c,"Maturity, emotional stability, groundedness - not being melodramatic.

I've never been rejected for hsv and I think this is because I'm very choosy about who I disclose to.

Sometimes you'll meet someone who is a lot of fun, and have a good laugh - but when serious things come up in conversation they can't really deal with it. Maybe the best way to describe this is ""fair weather friends"". I like to have quite deep conversations and debates, even on dates, and if I feel like a person cannot talk about their feelings, or reality, or they give off that vibe of ""everything is awesome and great"", that says a lot to me that they aren't very good at handling or confronting more difficult issues/emotions that crop up. 

People who deal in melodrama, bitchiness, gossiping, and are unable to keep things private (such as telling about their own friends personal life)... just not my cup of tea... since you know that disclosure is something that would likely provide them with entertainment, even if in the long term they were accepting of it.

I have had one person who accepted my diagnosis, told me it didn't change how she felt and wanted to keep seeing me, but who ultimately had a huge amount of anxiety around catching the virus, which ended up souring our relationship. She was too anxious and too much of a hypochondriac. My spidey senses picked that up at the beginning of the relationship, she was not emotionally grounded and very much a ""everything is great all the time!"" type of person. That's not real life. And I should have trusted my gut sooner. But she was I believe trustworthy, and respected my privacy.

I think for me all of this adds up to respect. Respect for where I am at in my life, respect for how I live with hsv, respect for my right to privacy and normalcy, respect for my feelings and concerns. If I feel respected and have their acceptance that's the goal. I would take respect but rejection over acceptance but no respect. Imagine being accepted by someone who doesn't respect you - that to me would be far worse than rejection.",2022-03-30 10:54:28,1
tr0t0c,"The people who tend to be open minded in general tend to be open minded to talk about STIs  and sexual health. I have been diagnosed for 10 years and have had  20+ partners since diagnosis. None of them to their knowledge have genital herpes some had cold sores. I am currently with a guy who is completely HSV negative he works at a blood lab and took a test just for shits and giggles.  He knows about my herpes I disclosed and he is completely fine with it and accepts the risks. There are plenty of people like this who do not care. Sitting around and waiting for a cure it’s silly you’re rejecting yourself before anyone even has a chance to think about it or reject you or accept you. You are putting limits on yourself before giving anyone else the opportunity to consider anything. People get rejected every day for a plethora of different reasons Sure there are people who ghosted me especially on tinder but as I talked to my friends I realized they got ghosted too and it wasn’t because of herpes it was because dating apps are cesspools in general.

It’s possible that’s all is it because they are really similar but staph is just one bump typically. What you could do if you have a CVS with a minute clinic, they possible can swab it or at least look at it. It’s not too expensive (60 bucks or so). If it’s just staph they can give you antibiotics or a topical. The fact that’s just one makes me think it’s not herpes.

Or choose the petty route and point the finger back at him, then laugh, and just lie, and say that he has it too. Start ridiculing him back cause then he would just look silly for making fun and ridiculing you for having something that he (may or may not) really have, but other people won't know that, because people are miseducated about hsv anyways and will just assume he has it too. 

You can also just laugh it off and make him look crazy, and say he was just making things up to slander you. Or both. (Or if you choose, you can take the power back from him and just come out with your status on your own accord.) Then what can he hurt you with if you already beat him to it? Tik tok has really good hsv awarness threads where many people are so open about having hsv and their sex life after their diagnosis. It could be liberating. Maybe some jerks would laugh, I think there are many who would rush to your defense. That's just me. I think even if you chose to, keep record of the blackmail texts.

It probably wouldn't win in court and you're going to spend money on a lawyer pursuing it  BUT it is a valid threat. 

If I was a douche bag and my boyfriend told me he was going to sue me for doing something, it would deter me.

But I unno.

You could use a threatening letter like  I have obtained legal counsel  and will sue you for pain and suffering damages blah blah 

OR  If you don't want to go this route .. you can put it out afterwards like.. what ?  This is petty. Spreading lies about me because you're scorned.  That's really pathetic of you. 

Or.. you could tell him he's an idiot and he thinks it's going to damage you when all it does is tell people that he also now has herpes.  So what he's trying to do to you will do it to him.
You could add the extra..  and you gave it to me... 

The last 2 are going to cause extra stress on you but it's an option. 

A guy from work told everyone I gave him herpes  and I just denied. But obviously a totally different scenario.

tr71kw,"Tbh this might be harsh, and I do understand that youre doing this out of frustration towards yourself, and out of fear, but your actions following your initial mistake reflect more poorly on you IMO.

You made a mistake when you were drunk. And it doesn't excuse it, but it's clear that you feel awful and are genuinely remorseful. But for that to matter you need to own up to it. None of what youre doing now helps this boy, it only protects you from facing dealing with his response.

He deserves to know that he had unprotected sex with someone with herpes. He deserves better than to be ghosted by a close friend after sex. And he deserves to be the one deciding if he forgives you for this. You're taking that away from him.

I know it's scary but the best thing to do for everyone involved  is to talk to him.",2022-03-29 20:10:32,2

tr71kw,Up until recently I have started my healing towards my diagnosis. I was so angry when I found out. I can only imagine how he will react to me telling him the truth. I am afraid because  there have been situations in our area where females have been attacked and /or killed for infecting men. I can’t tell him…I’m too afraid. Regardless of him being a close friend I wouldn’t be blame if he wanted to harm me. I deserve it.,2022-03-30 00:55:26,1

Saying that, for about an hour after i applied it - I felt no itching or anything. So i do think i applied too much causing the slight burning and itch spike. Do you mean hydrocortisone?

tr4nul,I’m not a doctor so no. But your symptoms & what you have going on wouldn’t make me think herpes,2022-03-30 12:23:35,2

tr4nul,"Said Cortisone too.   This is key.  Try Cortisone  with it for a couple days.  Yes hydro.  We have a product here in drugstores called Cortizone 10.

As for the pictures, it honestly looks like you’ve been scratching the living shit out of it for a long time and it’s both irritated and scabbing because of the fingernails and scratching. I could be wrong, but that’s what it looks like.

Sometimes I will take Bactrim, Cortizone, and Lotrimin and mix them together. This handles inflammation, bacterial infection, and fungal all at once. I had to hunt for the Bactrim and ultimately order it online. It’s better than Neosporin.

You are asking him to respect your boundaries and limits, he should be able to understand what those are.

It would solidify his feelings for me, like do his feeling outweigh the judgment? 

I wouldn’t sleep with him first, I vowed a 4 date minimum from now on before sex to see if I even want to sleep with them and if the shyness behind disclosure is worth it. If not I won’t sleep with them if call it off.

Honestly when I disclose, I don’t love to use stats because at the end of the day, they have to either be ok with the possibility of getting it and showing symptoms or not. The issue with stats is that there’s a lot of people out there that are carrying it that don’t know so the stats are mostly based off of those who actually showed symptoms and tested positive. I try to educate and be transparent. I don’t tend to have many issues with it and frankly find many other things to disrupt my life more than genital herpes.

The risk for HSV-2 transmission from men to women was 28.5 transmissions per 1,000 unprotected sex acts (95% CI, 10.8-74.1) and 1.3 male-to-female transmissions per 1,000 protected acts (95% CI, 0.4 to 4.5), yielding a 96% reduction in HSV-2 transmission with male condom use (95% CI, 84%-99%).",2022-03-28 23:02:14,5

tqhdaj,">My wife is struggling with yet another cold sore

Does she take herpes medication? If she experiences cold sore that she considers to be problematic, she could take herpes medication when a cold sore occurs to minimize it's extent and duration. Herpes medication is most effective when taken at the first sign of an outbreak, so it would be adviseable for her to get a supply of herpes medication to keep on hand in advance, for when a cold sore occurs. She could get a prescription for enough medication to treat *multiple* outbreaks.

Furthermore, if she considers her outbreak frequency to be problematic, she could also consider daily suppressive medication. For about half the people who take daily suppressive medication, it stops them from getting outbreaks *entirely*. For the other half it usually reduces outbreak frequency by at *least* 50%.

For a review of the various herpes medications and their standard dosages for outbreaks and daily suppression, please consult pages 20-21 of *The Herpes Handbook*, published and made freely available by herpes expert Terri Warren for online viewing or download here: [LINK](https://www.westoverheights.com/herpes/the-updated-herpes-handbook/).

>However, I've never had a cold sore. How is it possible that I could be married to someone for more than 20 years and not have contracted the virus myself?

There are numerous possibilities here. First, it is entirely possible that you've never caught it from your wife despite being married for 20 years.

Another possibility is that you *did* catch it from your wife but have never experienced symptoms.

And yet another possibility is that you actually had it already, before you started dating your wife, and your pre-existing infection has prevented you from any further infection from your wife. (with rare exception, a pre-existing herpes infection protects against any further infections by the same herpes type, in any body location).

More than half the population has hsv1, the vast majority of those infections are oral, and a full 70% of people who have it orally don't even know they have it because they've either never experienced noticeable symptom, or experience symptoms so minor that they mistake them for something else, or have forgotten about symptoms they experienced long ago but haven't experienced since.

Furthermore, even with IgG blood testing it's difficult to rule out the possibility of a person having hsv1. Because standard IgG blood tests miss a full 30% of hsv1 infections.",2022-03-28 22:06:18,1

tq96kn,"My initial outbreak was horrible.  Over a month later, I was still suffering with muscle pain, fatigue, nerve pain and I had a couple small subsequent outbreaks.  My doctor said there wasn't anything I could do except take my daily Valtrex.  So, I started eating healthy and walking a couple miles every day and made this my focus, rather than the herpes.  As a result, my stress lowered and within a couple weeks almost all of the pain was gone.  Rather than focusing on herpes, I focused on myself and my wellbeing.

When I had my initial outbreak and was diagnosed with herpes, I was devastated.  I thought my life was ruined and that it would never be the same.  When the pain wouldn't go away and after the additional outbreaks, I was convinced that my life was over.  All I could think about were all of the things i wouldn't ever be able to do again.  I almost accepted that I was going to live the rest of my life alone with chronic pain and stress.  I wanted to give up.

But, I didn't.  I didn't let the fear, shame and stigma win.  And neither should you, OP.  When shitty people do shitty things, it says everything about them and nothing about you.   The person who gave you herpes is irrelevant.  This, and what you are going through, has nothing to do with them.  But, it has everything to do with you.  What matters most is your life and how you choose live it.  You are in a bad place and you are not being kind to yourself.  If one of your friends confided in you that they were going through this, would you think that they are a failure and that their life is ruined?  Would you tell them that?  Of course you wouldn't.  You would be kind and encouraging.  Yet, you aren't kind and encouraging to yourself in this situation.

You are not a failure.  Your life is not over.  Your big dreams aren't lost.  They are right where you left them and they are waiting for you.  Herpes may seem insurmountable today but I promise you that it will get better.  And, I promise you that there will be a day that you stop thinking about it.

You've got this.",2022-03-28 17:03:16,8
tq96kn,"I totally get how you feel. There are days I feel okay about it and days where I get in my own head and beat myself up. However 80% of the population has some for of HSV, majority go unnoticed which is the cause of most of the transmissions. Everyone is bound to get it at some point in their lives. This virus sucks bc of the stigma and potential recurrences, but if you take care of your immune system (eat healthy, exercise, manage stress), you’ll be able to prevent likelihood of recurrences and transmission. This doesn’t affect your long term health so don’t let it take over your life and define who you are. Really shitty that person knew they had it and didnt give you the option by disclosing. Take it day by day and don’t think about the what if’s and dwell on the past. Definitely go see a therapist and be active in support groups as that will help knowing you’re not alone. 

I’m also struggling with this mentally and emotionally but what helps is looking at testimonies on YT or watching vids of ways on how to live with herpes. Educate yourself on the virus and you’ll come to realize it’s not as bad as advertising, the school system, society and pop culture has made it out to be.

tq96kn,"Ive had HSV for 6 years. At the beginning its hard, only because of the stigma and perhaps the circumstances that led us to catching it were traumatic. But don't misdirect your anger at the cold sores. Honestly, would you beat yourself up like this is you got the flu? A tick bite? A wart? No. Things happen and thats that, were humans. 

Focus on your mental health and working through the stigma we have ingrained into ourselves. The only reason we feel like shit about it is because we too were once the people scorning at others for getting HSV. Forgive yourself, remember cold sores cannot physically stop you, only you can mentally stop yourself. Time heals everything, its fresh now, but dont hesitate to speak to a therapist or at the very least get your butt in gear and work at your mental health.

I highly doubt most undiagnosed partners would agree with your assessment if they found out that it was genital after the fact. OHSV and GHSV are simply not the same. You are setting yourself up for far more difficult conversations down the road If you find yourself in a committed relationship and never told them the full truth of your diagnosis and they find out later. You do you, OP, this is just a strangers opinion.

tq4t3v,"Interesting perspective. I would agree for the most part but the psychological effect of ghsv vs ohsv is day and night. Sure it is a perception created by society, but nonetheless has a detrimental impact on an individual. 

Just look at past threads of people alienating themselves to protect others because they don’t want this happening to them. Sure it’s a cold sore in another part of your body, but nonetheless, but the mental toll of worrying about transmission to your loved one or someone else generally is far too strong. This obviously depends on how you initially perceived your primary outbreak with physical and emotional pain, and how much you’re willing to risk someone else to go through the same journey too.

If you do not feel comfortable about being honest with your partners about your sexual health then you shouldn't be having sex with them. Ethically it is the right thing to do and not doing so does have the unfortunate ability to heavily impact someone's long term physical and mental health.

tq4t3v,">You are saying that people who are aware that they carry an STD have no obligation to gather informed consent from their sexual partners before they expose them to their illness.

No, that's not quite what they're saying. They're talking about genital hsv1 specifically. Even the experts are split on that one.

While there is general societal consensus that ghsv2 should be disclosed, there isn't consensus regarding ghsv1. And more recent research has found that genital hsv1 is even less contagious than previously thought. Here's a fairly recent post about it: https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/kdc6sq/omg_i_just_found_out_my_genital_hsv1_only_sheds_4/

People with genital hsv1 are in a particularly difficult bind in terms of disclosure because if they do disclose, there's a fair chance that the other party will grossly over-estimate the degree of risk. Even if the degree of risk is accurately conveyed to the other party, in many cases the other party will still experience a degree of anxiety far out of proportion to the risk level. (aka irrational anxiety).

Here's a fairly recent example of one woman's experience of this: https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/kp7uoz/ignorance_is_bliss_struggling_with_hypocrisy/

So if a person with genital hsv1 discloses, there's a fair chance the partner will substantially over-react in a negative way. But if the person with genital hsv1 doesn't disclose, and any sort of ongoing sexual and/or romantic relationship develops and the person's status comes out later for any reason, the other partner may consider the lack of prior disclosure to be a severe betrayal of trust -- to the point that it could seriously undermine or even potentially destroy the relationship. Such as occurred here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/l0o98y/why_i_always_disclose/gk1g54b

Here's a direct quote from herpes expert Terri Warren:

>The experts disagree about what to do about the disclosure of genital HSV 1. We know that by two years out after a new infection, the average shedding rate is 4 days per year. And about half the population already has HSV 1.

([Source](https://westoverheights.com/forum/question/i-want-to-understand-more-about-ghsv-1/))

Note that Terrie is saying that by 2 years into a genital hsv1 infection it only sheds 4 days per year on average -- so only 4 days per year where transmission would even be possible. And remember that the vast majority of exposures to asymptomatic shedding *don't* result in transmission, so there's only 4 days per year when there would be any asymptomatic transmission risk at all and the risk would be *low*. Furthermore, about half the population already has hsv1 and so would be at no practical risk from a partner's genital hsv1 infection. They would already have hsv1 antibodies.

So I acknowledge your particular position on this matter but I think the issue is a bit more nuanced than how you're presenting it.",2022-03-28 21:23:21,5
tq4t3v,You can sue someone bc you don't like their shirt.  You're not going to win. Again most people already carry hsv1 and don't know. So even if they get it from someone how can they prove they didn't already have it? Plus how can they prove the person didn't disclose? Pretty sure it's non disclosure of a life threatening disease too.,2022-03-28 21:56:33,0
tq4t3v,Why are you getting down voted? Lol I love that people with genital hsv1 are expected to educate the consenting adults about a super common virus that 85% of adults have. Jesus christ.

tq4t3v,"Your lying by OMISSION. O-M-I-S-S-I-ON. Your not disclosing the whole truth. A critical detail that has been left out or excluded. You said you have hsv1, you need to really tell people the whole truth here about the other fact you told us, but are withholding from them. GHSV1. You are not disclosing to partners and allowing them to make a fully informed choice about whether they want to continue to pursue Intimacy with you knowing the risks associated with genital contact. Even if they are low. We wouldn't be here if there were no potential risks. 🙄 If the person knows, all the details of where it is, and wish to continue, that's their choice. Your whole disclosure approach is really manipulation at its finest. If it's wild why are you here? If it's right, why you asking for validation? Lol. 

There's consequences and repercussions for knowingly withholding critical information that can put people at risk and for all we know your knowingly infecting people who don't fully know what they are getting into, and are not letting them fully protect themselves. Socially or karma. On a reddit thread, or later down the line in your own life. You put this out there on a social platform. People are dishing you the facts and giving you the feedback you were cluelessly seeking. You know your condition. You naively put this out there knowing people would not agree with you. & the people who agree with ya, are kind of knuckleheaded too imo. It is really black and white at this point.

tq4t3v,"So you shitting on people with ghsv2 right? Because its more contagious, so u rubbin it in.",2022-03-28 09:10:06,-8
tq4t3v,"Whether a person sheds 1 day a year or 100 days a year I still believe that the other person that is engaging in the sexual relationship has a right to consent to that exposure no matter how minuscule it may be. Using condoms and antivirals reduces the spread of herpes but does not eliminate it so informed consent is critical to embarking on a healthy sexual relationship. For some people, hearing that their partner sheds 4 days a year won't be a problem but for others it may be an issue that they do not want to expose themselves too.

 It is not my place to judge a person's personal risk assessment level when it comes to their health so to prevent any issues with crossing someone boundaries I feel it is best to be considerate and disclose to all partners to gain informed consent before furthering things to a sexual level. I will always stand by that belief because a lot of people ended up with an STD due to their partners not being open and honest about their health status.",2022-03-28 22:00:33,1
tq4t3v,"Doesn't matter the person is still contagious. 4 days a year or 365. It's wrong. Period. I didn't have hsv 1 in my body ,4 years ago. I don't care what the stats are. It still happened. And still happens- destroying people's lives.",2022-03-29 04:33:20,1
tq4t3v,"""In some part, the charges for knowingly failing to disclose depend on the STD involved. If the STD is HIV/Aids, a person could be charged with attempted murder. If the STD is herpes, a person could be charged with assault.

In Texas, assault is defined as intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causing bodily harm to another person.  Assault is grounded in an unwanted touching. If a person discloses the condition to a potential partner and the partner knowingly consents, the person with the condition has a defense.
In Texas, assault can either be charged as a misdemeanor or a felony depending on the circumstances. Assault that causes physical harm is most often charged as a Class A misdemeanor which is punishable by up to 1 year in jail and a fine up to $4,000.""


Going through the legal ramifications of possibly being hit with an assault charge or a civil suit because someone didn't disclose their STD are not worth the risk to the damage it can inflict on one's own life and the life of others. Whether the person wins or not isn't the only issue. Having to have one's personal health information exposed through the court system is embarrassing and costly. Being responsible and having an honest conversation to gain consent with sexual partners is key. Disclosure is the right thing to do.

tqcup3,What were ur symptons?,2022-03-28 20:22:58,1
tqcup3,Sounds on brand. A few years before my HSV1 diagnosis I tested positive for syphilis which they initially thought was herpes. I am a man but sometimes I will have sex with other men. Once I revealed that to the doctor they tested me for syphilis which I tested positive for and got the shot. Apparently men who have sex with other men have a higher chance of contracting syphilis.,2022-03-29 06:14:24,1
tqcup3,Yep. That's what this was a case of. Had a friend who it happened to as well.,2022-03-29 00:31:06,2
tqcup3,Message sent.,2022-03-28 17:33:06,1
tqcup3,"* Single (or maybe two) dark red sores underneath the head of my penis. Painless. 
* They break in the shower two weeks later. The pain I experience are from the raw skin rubbing when I walk, run, or have erections (especially in my sleep in my underwear). 
* I have a brief couple days of fever, flu symptoms. Swollen lymph nodes. 
* Several weeks later, while the sore is still not healing quickly and there is some yellow sticky pus, I start getting more symptoms. Very swollen foreskin, white dry skin, taughtness of penis, white bumps.
* The white stuff and swelling is diagnosed as Balanitis and male yeast infection, triggered by whatever the initial infection was (the assumption was Herpes, but it turned out to be Syphilis). 
* General fatigue sets in. I feel a bit weaker, not crazily so but enough that it's a more noticeable struggle when running and working out. 
* Rash on my trunk (chest and back). Almost looks like chicken pox. Doesn't itch. 

That's about all of my symptoms.",2022-03-29 00:35:33,2

tqaqtn,"I’ve had two very mild outbreaks in the past 6 months or so and we’ve been having consistent sex that whole time. Didn’t realize it was a flare up since it was so mild, thought it was a friction burn, ingrown or pimple. This time, we had sex on Sunday, I had the same small OB in the same spot starting later that day (I think induced by friction and stress) and I got tested Wednesday, and got my results this Sunday. So over the span of a week",2022-03-29 04:24:26,1
tqaqtn,i think i might be going through something similar. where do you get your outbreaks if you don’t mind me asking? also did you get a swab or blood test when you went to get tested? you should also double check your blood test to confirm it’s not in the false positive range,2022-03-29 19:35:52,1
tqaqtn,"I have had them both in the same spot, just inside one side of my outer labia. A cluster of 3-5 sores. I got a blood test done through LabCorp. I’m not sure how to double check the range - any guidance?

tqh7d4,Yes I got a swab test:) I know I forsure have ghsv1 I’m just not sure how to tell the difference now between that and actually razor bumps,2022-03-28 19:47:32,2
tqh7d4,From my understanding it should have a white head and a red ring around it… but it’s also hard to tell 100% which is why herpes often gets misdiagnosed as something else 🥲,2022-03-28 20:16:28,1
tqh7d4,You’re right 😫 I think I just shouldn’t shave honestly. I’m going to just treat all bumps like that just incase. Thank you 💗,2022-03-28 20:42:04,1

tqlr7p,"Being sick or having a low immune system doesn’t result in higher IGG levels.   That would only be the case if you were testing viral load which isn’t an available test with herpes.

tq8x1q,"Bit of an unfair statement i reckon really. Just because someone doesn't want to engage sexually with someone who has herpes doesn't necessarily mean they are unable to deal with other life problems such as finances and family problems. We disclose and give people the chance to decide whether or not they'd like to continue seeing us and if they want to educate themselves further then great, if not, then no worries. That's THEIR personal choice, and we should not make them feel bad for making a choice based on what THEY want in life, not want WE want.",2022-03-28 13:47:53,2

tqdmp5,Why do you say this,2022-03-29 04:58:26,1
tqdmp5,Bcz I had few negative blood tests before vaccination and a few after but I also got 1 positive. I searched and there was evidence of covid antibodies causing false positive with hsv. So I wanted to confirm,2022-03-29 05:22:34,1
tqdmp5,was it a low positive? A range of things can cause false positives,2022-03-29 05:27:48,1
tqdmp5,"So my test at 6 weeks post exposure was negative. (0.28)
Then I got covid vaccine at 8 weeks
After 12 weeks I went for another anti body test
It was negative at (0.5)
Then I went for another anti body test at 15 weeks
It was positive with huge value (3.38)
Really worried went for another test next day from the same lab.
Result was negative at (0.7)

Got confused changed the lab at 16 weeks post exposure.
Result was negative. (0.3) index value.

So I am really worried why I got a positive. But then I think may be covid antibodies has to do with it as I have huge immunity from Covid as I got my immunity also tested.",2022-03-29 07:10:58,1

tqaem8,You can try looking it up. Search the herpes handbook maybe it’s in there somewhere. But I’m 100% sure ohsv2 has the lowest shedding rates out of all herpes.,2022-03-30 01:28:23,1
tqaem8,If you didn't want to answer it you simply didn't have to. I've been looking through articles everywhere and the only thing I keep coming across is that medication makes you transfer it 50% less but nothing so far has listed what the initial number is to begin with.,2022-03-30 16:22:27,1
tqaem8,I tried my best. There’s not a lot of studies on ohsv2 cuz it’s so rare. That’s why I said the herpes handbook might have something? Was that a shitty answer? Idk,2022-03-30 18:54:04,1

tq9vvr,"Did she ask you what your sexual health status was? Also what type of herpes do you have? 
I think you should definitely tell her, and maybe would have been ideal to mention it before but you’re only human so don’t be too hard on yourself. Also don’t let this community crucify you.

Honestly you’re fine, you’re not a bad person and you didn’t not tell her out of spite or irresponsibility but because you were scared. 
If you tell explain that to her and say at the time you had sex there was very little risk of transmission she’ll understand and appreciate your honesty. 
The people on here that say ‘you’ve lost her trust’ ‘she won’t want you’ and projecting their own situation and what they have been through.

tq6ijv,"As far as I know it’s pretty low too. If you don’t have any ulcers, GHSV1 sheds rarely, and declines after the first year of transmission.

tq9i61,If you don't have an outbreak you cannot do a swab which is the most reliable test for herpes. You can always do blood tests but specifically say you need it tested for herpes. Although yes they're likely to be unreliable and do false positives/negatives. I think to know for sure you'd need a few of them done with reasonable time in between.,2022-03-28 14:16:11,1
tq9i61,If you’ve had herpes for a long time then a igg blood test will show results. Igm I believe only works if you have a current outbreak and even then if it is positive and you have no symptoms then it can be wrong. If you do have symptoms it helps to tell if it’s a fals positive or not,2022-03-28 15:33:17,1

tq5ntm,Yes no interactions. Safe to take with party drugs but amphetamines can trigger outbreaks,2022-03-28 11:27:37,1
tq5ntm,Fine to combine. However every time I take mdma I have an outbreak since mdma suppresses your immune system. Worth the trade off tho,2022-03-28 18:59:26,1

tpy3xn,"I understand being afraid of disclosing. I have been diagnosed for 10 years and have had  20+ partners since diagnosis. None of them to their knowledge have genital herpes some had cold sores. I am currently with a guy who is completely HSV negative he works at a blood lab and took a test just for shits and giggles.  He knows about my herpes I disclosed and he is completely fine with it and accepts the risks. There are plenty of people like this who do not care. Sitting around and waiting for a cure it’s silly you’re rejecting yourself before anyone even has a chance to think about it or reject you or accept you. You are putting limits on yourself before giving anyone else the opportunity to consider anything. People get rejected every day for a plethora of different reasons Sure there are people who ghosted me especially on tinder but as I talked to my friends I realized they got ghosted too and it wasn’t because of herpes it was because dating apps are cesspools in general. Dating nowadays sucks for so many reasons if you want to pin it on herpes go for it but that’s not the only reason. I was diagnosed with ghsv-1 at 19 and I thought my life was over I didn’t tell a soul cut off friends and everything because I felt so disgusting and gross. But eventually I put myself out there and had a few positive disclosure s and i began to realize that I was the one creating the stigma for myself.. The more people I told the less it weighted me down. Think of it logically friends should care because it doesn’t effect them. The only people your herpes effects are the people you are sleeping With. Friends are supposed to be your support system and if you tell them your story they should not judge you And they will learn from you And your experience. Hell you May even help a fellow herpes person out becuase if someone discloses to your friend after you teach them about herpes they will be more understanding and knowledgeable about it. But that’s up to you. I’ll attach some links that have seemed to help people and if you need anything please dm me.I’ve had it for almost a decade at this point and have a pretty good handle on it.

This first link is info about a support group I’m in. All herpes people from all over the world we all share are experiences, vent , swap info and remedies, and just talk about life it’s an awesome place to be for sure.

But i quickly realized that the right people will not judge you and they will love you regardless, and how common it truly is. Out of 6 guys in 2 years, 2 also had hsv. A big downer is you do have to be very particular with who you decide to share your story with and sleep with.

tpncxv,"I know it’s hard to face this feeling, but with all due respect, you are putting this man on a pedestal. You’ve only known him for a few weeks, how can you know he’s your soul mate?

Yes, you clicked very well, but the more people you date, the more you’ll realize that this feeling is actually not that rare. Uncommon? Maybe. But not so rare that this will be the last person to ever make you feel this way. 

I’ve dated very regularly in the past, going on several first dates in one week was a common thing for me for a number of years, so maybe we just have different lived experiences. 

But consider that this person could have any number of negative traits, habits, secrets that you don’t yet know about. Maybe it’s *you* who’s dodged a bullet and you just don’t know it yet. Fast forward a few months and maybe you’ll see his mug shot on your news feed. You just never know, so it’s best not to assume extreme positives or negatives about what could’ve been.

Maybe you feel like he’s your soul mate, but you shouldn’t assume that he feels the same way just because everything was going smoothly before disclosure. And do you want to be with someone who doesn’t reciprocate that feeling?

I guarantee that if you meet one new person a week for the next year, you’re bound to run into one, or several, more people who make you feel this way.",2022-03-27 21:25:37,8

Now I have HSV-2 from someone afraid to be honest about their test result fearing rejection.  I personally would get to know a romantic interest as a true friend that I was considering as a potential marriage mate and confirm they were doing the same before asking them to make a date to get a STD panel including for Herpes and HIV.  This would also weed out the players/users and lessen broken hearts.   This process could take many months. There is no rush to be sexual.  Build something based on respect and admiration vs wanting a hot body or worst because they're horny and you're nearest in proximity.  Then share your written test results with the other - never take their word for it.  People form emotional attachments (roots) and grow together when they share intimate experiences i.e. their health results.  They need to be invested in your happiness over their own.  If only you come back positive, well now you have a protective friend that truly cares about you and will help you research Herpes and find out its really not that big and scary as they thought.  The hookup culture treats people like shiny objects to be used and tossed aside - they just want the cookie without any time invested or  work.  (Masturbation is highly underrated.)  It's now up to us to educate others and lead them to be tested.  The medical community sure isn't going to do it.",2022-03-27 23:25:04,4
tpncxv,"Awh, big hugs. Sadly, if it's the first time someone is confronted with that situation and they don't know much about herpes, it's not too surprising especially if they're in their mid-twenties.

A couple of years ago I went on a few dates with a girl who kindly informed that she had herpes. At the time, I didn't know anything about it other than that it's incurable. I didn't see her as a life partner and decided to put an end to things delicately.

If I did think that she was a potential life partner, it would've been a tougher decision but I can't say with certainty what I'd have done - what if things hadn't worked out? I simply didn't know much about herpes at all at the time.

Now... I have herpes, woohoo! Obviously I know a lot more about it now because of this, and I understand that it's honestly not a big deal (I've only recently got it, but will of course tell all future partners about it).

What I will say is that if I knew what I know now about herpes, but didn't have it, then I wouldn't hesitate to pursue a relationship with someone who is positive, if I thought there was a chance of it working out.

So there's hope! I'm a different person now, approaching my thirties, which plays a big part. So you'll find your right person, they might just be a little older than this guy :)",2022-03-27 20:25:28,3

Since we are both young(ish), my thoughts kept landing on the fact that if we broke up she is still an insanely desirable woman with a million options, but I would become a social pariah.  The stigma is not divided evenly.  Men pursue and women choose.  If you’re a sexy woman with herpes, the dating world is still your sandbox, only a tiny bit smaller.  I couldn’t risk that she wasn’t going to change her mind about me at some future date.  Maybe propose abstinence before marriage if you truly feel like you are losing your soulmate.  If I could have a do-over, I would float that idea to my lost love.  She wouldn’t have gone for it, but at least I wouldn’t have been the “bad guy” for ruining something because of her “minor skin condition.” And if she went for it and we married?

You were about to fuck me with no protection? And now you’re uncomfortable about the fact that I have herpes ? Ooof! The rationale just isn’t there for me",2022-03-27 19:48:53,8

He told me multiple times that I am everything he’s looking for in a partner. Although that could just be words , I do believe it as it played out in his actions as well. He is definitely not what you would expect a “normal” single 26 year old male to be like . .

I am going to encourage the blood test. I completely agree with you. He has likely been exposed and doesn’t know. I just hate the stigma and negative talk about it. Sure, nobody wants it but it’s not the end of the world .",2022-03-27 17:09:11,3

Fortunately yes I do not have any issues usually. I disclose , nobody cares, we do the thing or date or whatever and we don’t ever talk about it. But I think of those that I’ve been intimate with with no protection who then move onto someone else. Do they tell their new partner that they fucked someone with herpes and no protection?? HIGHLY doubt it . But I’m the bad guy for having gotten tested and knowing I have it.

My honest opinion is that if you’re ready to have sex without condoms and any talks about sti’s, then you’re almost agreeing to getting one. It shouldn’t be on our shoulders and it shouldn’t change anything 🙄
But as you’ve mentioned in your other comments, I think it’s because it’s the first time he’s met someone with herpes and has experienced someone being honest. He will most likely be getting it in the future and regret he missed out on you.",2022-03-27 20:26:20,4

Supposedly sex during an outbreak can trigger an outbreak in your partner but I’m sure it depends on the individual. Other than that the only downside would be uncomfortable/painful sex, but that also just depends on the severity and location of your outbreak. 

You would need to contract HSV2 orally to have an HSV2 outbreak on your mouth/lips.

So I never kept track of anything but I’m thinking I’ve been having symptoms for a good 20 or more days. Most itchiness and burning went away but I still have a few itchy spots. Not as sever but annoying especially out in public. I just started getting leg pain again and I feel a little numb in a few spots of my vulva (looks more like a rash than herpes bumps so maybe not herpes bumps but im most certain it is considering all of my symptoms).Could be my paranoia after reading about numbness. Im hoping it goes away soon but at least for me I’ve been feeling this since the beginning of March :/

I also was not prescribed anything. At the time I got checked I was not feeling much discomfort and so the doctor did not leave me anything.

If it it stress then a bit harder to deal as well as periods. There are proven ways to reduce stress and those could be googled. 

For periods - going on daily birth control could help or antivirals. If valacyclovir doesn't help you could try acyclovir as some people find one works better than other for them.

Is there a chance you passed it? Yes. There’s always a *chance* but having sex with someone doesn’t guarantee transmission, especially if it was protected. 

I know it’s stressful, but you’re overthinking it. This is probably because you waited two years to start dating again so this feeling is new and overwhelming.

The first outbreak is always the worst and you will improve each time. 1 in 2 people have herpes; 1 in 4 have genital herpes. You are far from alone in this. Many people go decades without an outbreak after that first outbreak/year. The first year of acceptance and initial outbreaks will be the hardest, but it gets immensely better over time. So much so that once you are past the initial period you will come to realize it's not a big deal at all, it's just been so stigmatized that we are initially shocked into terror. I promise everything will be just fine in the end. It's a lot to digest. Don't be so hard on yourself.",2022-03-27 17:01:44,2

I’d wait until your outbreak has finished and the you’ll be fine having sex again!
Sorry you’re outbreak is painful, the cream and the pills should really help so well done for being proactive! I have genital HSV1 and got it the same as you, and my outbreak was only 8 days long (4 days most painful) and I’ve never had an outbreak since.

But my first outbreak was also my last one, It's been almost a year since it happened and I'm still here, you are lucky that a loved one gave it to you because he is still with you. I am alone and don't really feel like I deserve to keep having sex with anyone, no girl deserve it, it was my fault... but yeah it gets better, in a week you'll be perfect and if you are lucky you will not see any outbreak in years!!

tpnikw,"I was diagnosed at 18 too. I was *terrified* and in so much pain. Getting on antivirals is a good start though! That means things should start clearing up soon. I know a lot of people see “incurable” and run the other way, but as others have said, herpes is super common and if you take the right precautions, you’ll be golden. I’m 23 now and I also have GHSV1, and I’ve never transmitted it to a single one of my sexual partners. 

Also, in the meantime, try peeing in the shower with the water on, or get one of those water bottles that you can squeeze to squirt out and pour it over the area. Makes it a lot easier. Loose-fitting clothing will also help.

I've had a partner with cold sores and thought no big deal of it, but didn't know it was contagious. Upon hearing my diagnosis, I was shocked and went on the internet and realized people were having strong debates about disclosing, which had me second guessing. 

I think your point about presuming every sexual partner has HSV-1 is a very solid point, especially once I found out that a significant amount of the population has this virus. I also completely agree with the unfairness of the blissful ignorance that many people get to enjoy as they simply just do not know their status since it's not widely tested, in contrast with the few who end up finding out their status and struggle with disclosing or not.",2022-03-28 19:18:01,1

Make sure your vitamin D level is above 30-35.   

Take lysine 500mg daily and have a couple eggs for breakfast (another 1,400mg lysine).  Get sufficient sleep.

It works for a lot of people, of all genders. Don't get pissy if someone declines, that's their right.

tp8is7,"Hey dude, I’m going to relay some words to you from my perspective but please take these, not as an insult, but rather as support and encouragement (tough love type shit - cause I understand bro). I know your feelings all too well and it hurts me to see others like this because I was once in that position (Currently still kind of am to be honest). Your life isn’t ruined by herpes. It’s how you’re handling your diagnosis that’s “ruining” your life. You’re probably in that period where you just discovered you have herpes and now you feel like an outcast especially with society viewing people with herpes as “tainted” or “dirty” - to which I say, I understand. Have your moments of sadness and grief and find some solutions to help you return back to normalcy, but to let something like herpes make you feel like your life is over and you have nothing else to live for? Come on bro, stop being a pussy. I didn’t even get herpes from any sexual encounter. I just got cold sores one day and found out that I had herpes from who the fuck knows where. Also, I’ve never had any sexual or love experience with any females in my life. I’m 25M, fat, and balding (well bald now because I bit the bullet and shaved it all off) so I know for a fact that I probably won’t be getting any females soon especially now that I have herpes added onto my plate. At first I was so furious. This anger was beyond “regular” anger because I didn't do anything to get this - I was just living my day to day. Life just said ""fuck you, here's herpes"". Herpes just showed up in my life and I didn’t know even know how. So now I’m stuck with the fact that I already have no love life (or social even), young and already bald, (being fat can be changed but it doesn’t help), and now HERPES??? Fuck my life right? Well, yes and no. Yes being the fact that you can’t not admit that my situation sucks and I know that, I understand it, and I even embrace it, but also no. No at the fact that my life is still worth living and enjoying. I’m still living. I have shelter, food, water, a decent paying job, and good friends and family. There are others in worse positions with more harmful diseases, physical or mental damage, etc. Now, please note that I am not trying to make this a competition nor do I know how your life has been so I am not trying to make any points based on that. However, the point I am trying to make is that life fucking sucks, but we ourselves have the choice to determine if it will keep sucking on our own accord or do something about it to make it better. We all have problems whether we are rich, poor, dumb, smart, beautiful, ugly, etc. You have your issues + herpes, I have my issues + herpes. However, to establish that your whole life is ruined because you now have some benign skin condition that society deems as “disgusting” is just down right ridiculous. You’re essentially putting your whole worth, your WHOLE POTENTIAL even (because you still have years ahead of you to become a better version of yourself) on the fact that you have some skin condition. You’re better than that bro and I know so because you’re worth more than just a herpes diagnosis - which I should remind you, about 80%+ of the world has (with or without knowing). So what I’m trying to get at is, you can be sad, angry, or suicidal even (don’t be suicidal though you have much to live for) about your herpes (I know I have), but at the end of the day, your life is what you make it. Do you want to live the rest of your life with the fact of having herpes is affecting your lifestyle, choices, opportunities, etc? Or do you want to accept it (because that’s the only real way of getting past it) and  determine the quality of your life through the actions you make, the mindset you have, and the opportunities you conquer instead? I have had so many things go wrong in my life and the stuff that I just mentioned about me are just the tip of the iceberg. I’ve hit rock bottom many times and especially with my recent diagnosis of herpes, I felt like I have reached a new level. However, I realized that I still have years ahead of me which I can choose two ways of approaching it. One: remain rock bottom and have all the negative things in my life weigh me down and affect my mindset, thus forcing me to live life with an existential dread and never climb out of the hole I dug myself and am currently digging deeper because of the mindset I have - “surviving” until I am dead. Or two: accept the things that have happened to me that can’t be fixed (whether or not it’s my fault) and look ahead - look at the possible choices or opportunities I can take on in the future to improve my life and myself. To not let my negative experiences control my way of living and thinking. To allow myself to be motivated to make more out of my current situation and me as a person. Because when I’m at my death bed, I’m not going to be thinking about how herpes or balding made my life go to shit and how I lived a shit life because of that. I’m going to be thinking about regretting at all the stuff I could have accomplished, relationships I could have formed, or who I could have become - if I wasn’t so torn apart by the all the shit life decided to give me which made me live in mediocrity. So bottom line is, you can feel like shit about the herpes diagnosis - have your time and moment to grief (I took a week off of work to process my diagnosis). However, once you accept this fact, move on and start thinking about how you can take this shitty hand that life dealt you, and personally turn it around through your actions to make your life and yourself better. Do you want to be the guy who had herpes that hated himself? Or do you want to be someone that has accomplished something (or many things) in their lives (big or small) and enjoyed every last second of it to its fullest with no regrets… aaaaand who happens to have herpes which 80%+ of the world has. Your call man. Keep your head up king 👑. You’re being blinded from your true potential because of a skin condition. Life moves on and so should you.

(Also I know herpes may be more than just a skin condition, but point still stands)

If you’re a decent person you tell your potential partner upfront before anything happens and I’d imagine it ruins a lot of potential relationships. I honestly don’t know what to say to make this better other than the outbreaks should get better with time. Maybe you find a partner who is also positive so this is not an issue for you both.

It’s between those 1 on 1 convos and intimate moments of vulnerability where you really show case the real side of you. Trust me I’ve gotten rejected but also been accepted but overall being honest about it and really being open and vulnerable to people you will gain the utter most respect.

But you only think that way not because u believe it as a proven facts but because society tells us that before you get infected 

Herpes is very common especially hsv1, majority people like u said have it and dont know, they unintentionally pass it on( think about the amount of people that is how much people they infect(which is a negative term imo) then there are the peoole who dont care.  At that point its basically a battle of time against the inevitable.   

If u ask for a full sti test. They never outright include herpes.  I think its because majority of people will have it and not have symptoms.   And even if they do they prolly mistake it for something else.  The ones who do have the obvious symptoms have no choice but to get checked out

Basically everyone eventually will get some form of herpes.  Accepting is hard and letting go of the person u saw before is hard. But truly accepting is knowing that this doesnt change you in anyway. The thing tjat changes is how u see your self from your perspective and the world.  Be confident once you learned to love the you that alreayd great.  Youll be able to connect and have a aocial life like u want.   But u have to be confident in ya self.   Its sucks i get but one saying that i came up with [trademarked]😂
“May you shine your brightest when shrouded in darkness” if life seems dark.  You have to be your own reason to push on. Find that fire.  Get angry and dint let it beat and keep you down.  

Ps.  Think about it this way. Medicine is always advancing.  You would be tight if u killed yourself and they came out with a cure 5 years later",2022-03-27 02:27:25,1
tp8is7,So all the millions pf people without symptoms like me but who dont get tested get a free pass tp enjoy life while mine is ruined how is that fair. It should not fall on people who proactively test to shoulder the entire burden of disclosure,2022-03-27 03:51:29,1
tp8is7,"""I am sick of pretending herpes does not ruin YOUR life"",  not mine :)

Presumably you are in your early days of diagnosis? It can take a long, long time to accept this condition- it took me years.

Whilst you are perfectly within your rights to be angry and upset, in time you need to ask yourself who does this serve?

As someone who has had hsv for over 10 years, basically my entire adult life (and a male), I can tell you your sex life is most definitely not over. Nor do you need to worry about how you're going to infect ""the only one that accepts you"" (bs btw).

With antivirals and condoms you are extremely unlikely to pass the virus on. If you happen to have hsv1 then it's even less of a concern given that such a huge percentage of the population already have it. The fact you are asymptomatic means you are way less likely to shed. For hsv2 it's basically halved.

Is it unfair that you feel a burden that you have to disclose whilst others live in blissful ignorance? Yes. Life is unfair, get used to it. There are far worse conditions/diseases/illnesses you could have right now which would blow hsv out of the water.

You will get through this, but it will take time. I strongly suggest you seek out counselling/therapy as your post reads as though you are struggling.

The vast majority of people with hsv do not kill themselves, do not live lives of celibacy; they live meaningful, healthy, happy lives. Do not self sabotage.",2022-03-27 05:36:19,1
tp8is7,It’s over for you if you aren’t a good looking dude or tall because you might not of even had options before the diagnostic. This only makes it harder to find anything.,2022-03-27 06:04:15,1
tp8is7,"It’s not the end of the world at all my dude. I have 3 family friends who all have herpes that I found out about after my diagnosis. All three of which have had it longer than 15 years ( 1 has had it for ~15, another has had it for over 23 years and another has had it for 30+ years. The 30 and 23 are in happy married relationships with someone who has not contracted HSV from them. They get tested frequently and most likely due to the daily suppressant that they take it highly reduces viral shedding and obviously they just don’t have sex during an outbreak. The one who’s had it for 15 years is currently in a relationship with a boyfriend for 3 years now, she has unprotected sex all the time with him and in fact she hasn’t had an outbreak for over 6 years. The other two get maybe one outbreak a year IF that. It’s manageable, just tough at the start. I was in the same situation as you felt like my world was crashing down on me but I spent countless hours doing research, watching stigma and informational videos on youtube, started going to the gym this week which honestly has GREATLY increased my mental health, watch my arginine intake and eat things that are high in Lysine. If you’re having suicidal thoughts please please please go speak with a therapist. 

Yes, this sucks for us all. It’s scary and a major shock when you first get it. But everything will be alright down the line. I hope you find peace in your diagnosis. Work on yourself, do things that you love and make you happy and just keep being the best person that you can be everyday.",2022-03-27 09:47:30,1

tp8is7,"I hear your pain, brother. I'm 40 and got it in college, so I've been dealing w it for awhile. 

This is my advice: suppressive valtrex everyday. I know it sucks, but it is the best thing that you can be doing for yourself mentally and the best way to protect your partners. Without any symptoms and while on suppression, your ability to spread it is negligible (even less if you use a condom). Essentially, the drug makes you the safest bet out there bc you're doing something proactively and scientifically proven to bring the risk of transmission as low as possible. Be thankful that there is valtrex as it was only released in 1996 and came off patent only a few years ago. It was very expensive before it came off. 

If it helps too, girls are more susceptible to it and are the majority of the carriers, so they have to be extra vigilant and should appreciate what you are doing.",2022-03-27 01:49:05,2

Do you get oral symptoms? Is that how you know you have it in both places? 

Are you educated about ohsv1 and ghsv1? Your ohsv1 is actually more infectious than your genital hsv1. 

[These are average shedding rates](https://westoverheights.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Updated-Herpes-Book.pdf):

HSV 2 genital 15-30% of days evaluated  
HSV 1 genital 3-5% of days evaluated   
HSV 1 oral 25% of days evaluated  
HSV 2 oral 1% of days evaluated 

It will vary depending on how many outbreaks you get, how long you've had it. We know now that if you've had ghsv1 longer than 2 years, you are shedding about 4 days a year outside of outbreaks. You can take daily antivirals to reduce this, generally by half. 

We don't have transmission data for hsv1 like we do for hsv2. 

67% of people under 50 globally have hsv1 already. If they already have it, you can't re-infect them. Just talk to them. Have them test if it's going to be a long-term thing. 

If it's one night thing, then just say what I said above, and change it to hsv1. I mean, how do you even know they don't have HPV or syphilis or something if you aren't talking?

I personally have only been rejected once and it was recently with a guy I've known for years. It was a mutual rejection lol because I know he is a bit of a hypochondriac and I would never forgive myself If I transmitted it to him.  I wouldn't bother giving him the speech about taking meds and low transmission blah blah   so I said we can't do this bc I have herpes and I can't risk that with you. 

I've had one guy say  ""whatever who cares "" and didn't even want a condom. 

Another asked me questions about transmission and how will he know if he got it. We used a condom and that was that.

I'm not saying it's ever easy.  I danced around not disclosing because I couldn't handle the conversation.  I thought about never dating again.  It's only been 4 months and I've come around to just telling people. 

I think its easier once you get a feel for how to tell someone  if you genuinely don't think it's a big deal, it will come out like it's not a big deal. If you think it's life ending  well then you'll tell them as if you're shameful. 

Again  I'm not saying it's easy. You'll be rejected sometimes and sometimes you won't.

tp92t3,"Depends.  
I always take meds if I'm sexually active. I don't disclose it when I'm wearing condoms. Oral is a toss-up. 

(NOW I WILL TELL YOU WHY)

For about a decade now I have been getting tested at least once a year for all stds. 

(OR SO I THOUGHT).....

Every year up until last year I tested clean. 

So last year once I tested positive, I did research. 

It turns out when you walk into a doctor's office and request to be tested for all STDs...
they DO NOT test you for herpes unless you specifically say you want to be tested for herpes or you have an outbreak.

This is following government guidelines.

What researchers found was that even when people would get a positive diagnosis it would not change their habits one bit. 

And since the disease will not hurt you or kill you or take any years off your life it's not a top priority. 

The only reason I know I have it is because I hooked up with a very skanky girl and wanted to be tested and mentioned all of the diseases I wanted to be tested for. 

So that is why most people in society have it and they will never know about it.

So if I never specified, I would never know, and anyone I hooked up with would never know, so there's no burden on me to disclose. 

And in the weird hookup culture we have now we can all be spreading it just from kissing and still not know.

So don't beat yourself up about it. 

If you only sleep with people that you mutually decide to test ahead of time with then you probably should disclose. 

The truth is every person over age 12 in this country got tested you would probably have a 70 to 85% positivity rate. 

Plenty of people get it from their parents from being kissed. 

Abstain if you have an outbreak and go on meds if you're sexually active.

But other than that don't let it stress you out. 

I still can't figure out how I got it or where. I could have had it for the last 20 years.",2022-03-28 19:42:17,1

If you have thoughts about not being alive, it's time for therapy. That's depression. It's now a separate thing from herpes, and needs separate treatment. Even if herpes was magically cured tomorrow, your depression wouldn't magically go away.

It’s really hard, I know it is. 
And you feel like you can’t tell anyone? Feel ashamed? 

I was diagnosed only a couple weeks ago, and I feel terrible. But the first thing you have to do is tell someone. Anyone. 
I couldn’t bare to tell anyone I knew so I called a helpline, I didn’t know what else to do. They helped. They help me organise my thoughts a bit. 

Eventually I told an online friend, I was worried he wouldn’t want to be my friend anymore. But he still did. He accepted me, when I didn’t. 

I ended up talking to the nurse at uni and then the doctor at uni. It helps talking to people, they can give you a different perspective, I promise. 
They’ll explain things differently, help you see that it isn’t a reflection of you.

I told the guy I was talking to as well (started talking to him right before diagnosis) and he did his research, but he’s still talking to me. He accepts me more than I accept me. 

This virus doesn’t define you, it doesn’t mean anything about you. It is just bad luck, literally really fucking bad luck. 
I know it’s hard, I am still struggling to see it.

tpe1q2,"Hsv blisters don’t have white stuff coming out , they are clear fluid / or yellowish tinged clear fluid. 

Your ex or her mom is lying to her as cold sores are hsv. 

And getting sti tested only annually if you have multiple partners is likely not enough .  Standard tests rarely include hsv. The tests are not 100 % accurate so even if you are showing up negative on igg hsv1 ( especially )it has a 30% false negative rate, even if you leave the 12 weeks between partners to test. With about 70 % of us having hsv1 and a lot are all asymptomatic and either not being tested or the test is giving false negs it’s almost impossible to avoid hsv1 if you are involved in a poly life style. 

I think with regards to your bump or pimple it probably wasn’t hsv but that doesn’t mean you don’t have it or won’t get it. If you have a sore / lesion / blister get it swabbed 24-48 hr from when it appears , preferably pcr.

I also understand not every place is set up for hsv testing (which i find silly because of how common this seems) and sometimes nothing to swab. I have 1 nurse that thinks i need anxiety meds and others that say better to be safe about it. 

Besides this i have backed down from partners and setting for an appointment to get tested but timing seems to important as the spot has changed already. (Due to covid, my ex and the vaccines i have turned away from that lifestyle to work on myself)

But limitations even if you can get all potential partners to test , 1 might be even getting igg , second which is is big problem is it’s looking for antibodies so each partner would need to be tested at approx 12 weeks past last exposure & of course the problem with igg in general , overall false negs 30% hsv1 & 8 % hsv2 .

Because it’s easier and because it’s heavy to walk forward with this knowledge. How much easier to just not get tested - because knowing is scary. Especially when 80% of people have one form of hsv1 or hsv2. 

But maybe he did get tested and he is negative and that’s also fair enough for him.

I’m waiting on my WB results but have a feeling it will be similar- positive for hsv1 and negative for hsv2. 

I’m honestly hoping to find a long time partner with hsv1 then so we can have sex- oral and otherwise- unprotected and not worry about antivirals, etc. If my HSV2 is negative, it might depend on if I would choose to partner with someone hsv2 positive- and it wouldn’t necessarily have to do with the virus, it would have to do with how long and serious the relationship could/would potentially be.

I would think if you were having your first hsv OB it is related to your current GF. But day after unprotected sex isn’t enough time for an OB to appear ( if it’s hsv ). Your GF should be tested for hsv 1 & 2. Igg and swab if she is having an OB too.",2022-03-27 11:18:10,1

Your doctor discussing meds was only because you told him your sores might be herpes.  So he assumed you have outbreaks in general and this calls for meds.  But the two of you are getting your information mixed up a bit.  

Your sores were most likely not a new herpes infection.  As others have said, if you want a confirmatory test, wait 12 weeks and check the IgG. Yes. 1.17 is very possibly a false positive or an “it’s too early to check” number.  Check again at 12 weeks.",2022-03-28 06:41:30,1

tpc17y,"Okay so this result means you’ve had type 1 long term already.  Welcome to the club.  70% of the population.  No biggie.  

As for HSV2 the chances of this being a false positive are huge.  Especially if you don’t have symptoms. 

The closer you get to 1.0 the greater the chance of false positive.  Like 1.1 to 1.9 range.  Most people test positive at 3, 5, 10, 20.  

At 1.17 you’re looking at 90% chance this isn’t really positive.  

So breathe a sigh of relief.  

Now, if you want confirmation, simply wait until 30 days from your first blood draw and run it again. You can see if that HSV2 igg number is rising at all.  

Then test again at 12 weeks.  If you’re still hovering around 1.2 then you probably don’t have genital herpes.  

If at that point you want to be 10,000% sure, order a western blot test.  This will confirm yes or no.  

On its own, a 1.17 is most likely a false positive.  But you also tested SUPER early.  So tracking it every 30 days can give you some peace of mind while you wait for the 12 week test.

tpc17y,"Thank you, this gives me peace of mind. Just to note, the potential ""exposure"" would've happened on Jan 1st, roughly 2.5 months before the 1.17 score came in. I'm confident that my current girlfriend doesn't have herpes (or at least didn't give me it), so if I do have it, it would've come from this other girl I had sex with on new years (before we were dating).

Also, I was really drunk and totally botched the sex. I rubbed around looking for the hole but didn't make it in and she told me to stop (lol). So if I somehow contracted herpes THEN, jesus that's bad luck.  


In the past 5 days or so, a couple of lumps appeared on my shaft. This looks nothing like the images of herpes I can find online, but maybe someone could tell me if this looks similar to what they had.

The two lumps on the sides are my concern. The red blemishes and scab on the base are from the cluster of pimples I was referring to in my original post. The scab is bc I picked at one.

I don't know if this is an outbreak or what. There has been no pain at all, no oozy fluids besides the pimple I popped (which was white and chunky). The lumps will tingle a little bit when I walk around but I wouldn't say it's ""itchy"". Let me know if this relates to anyone's herpes experience. Do first outbreaks even happen \~3 months after exposure?

tp9irv,"> Would hsv cause cold symptoms for 4 days with no OB? 

>Update: he says he has a sore throat, congestion and headache but did not say if he had a fever. Does this indicate hsv?

When it is said that herpes can cause flu-like symptoms, this is referring to symptoms similar to those of *influenza* (ie the *flu*) ie headache, fever, general body aches all over (not highly focused in and limited to a very specific area), light sensitivity, and swollen lymph nodes near the region of infection but not elsewhere (eg in the groin for genital infections, or in the head/neck for oral infections). Herpes would *not* cause symptoms of a cold, ie stuffy nose, runny nose, sore throat, cough, congestion, sinus issues, etc. (Oral herpes *could* cause a sore throat if it were to cause actual lesions in the throat itself, but that is very rare.)

Furthermore, the only circumstance in which herpes has the potential cause flu-like symptoms is from from a brand new infection that occurred within 2-10 days prior, and such symptoms would only occur if the person was experiencing at least moderate-to-extensive visible blisters/lesions as well, that would appear within a day or two of the flu-like symptoms, if not sooner.

So no, your partner's symptoms are not at all suggestive of herpes, in numerous respects.",2022-03-27 04:05:35,1

That doesn't mean that it is definitely false positive, but if you've never experienced an outbreak, then you're either asymptomatic or it's false positive.   The WB is only 70% accurate toward HSV1 determinations... so I'd say wait until 12 weeks after your last exposure to HSV2 and take the Western Blot (WB) to check for both.

After living with it for almost two years, 90+% of days I forget I have it. I only had initially symptoms for 7 days or so. Haven’t felt or seen anything since those first symptoms subsided almost 2 years ago. 

It was brave of her to tell you considering that most people with herpes either don’t know they have it or don’t feel the need to tell new partners because it effects them (the carriers) so little after a certain point and the chances of transmission are so low. You might already have herpes yourself, or at least already had sex with someone who has it, without even knowing. 

No regrets when my ex gave me herpes. Did I want it? No, but I don’t resent her for giving it to me. There is so much grey area on the matter that this sun overlooks. The initial shock is jarring, but strep throat was worse than herpes for me in my opinion.",2022-03-25 22:24:13,11

It's not the end of the world, but it does put an obstacle in your life that you can avoid if you're careful and vet the people you become romantic with.

You do not know how hard it is for men to get any form of intimacy when you have hsv from the opposite sex after disclosing. Women also have it difficult when wanting a relationship/marriage but they can still have sex with the opposite sex and that's a level of intimacy men will struggle with. Most men won't leave the talking stage.

 What she's saying about previous men having unprotected intercourse for x years and no one caught anything can be true or false. There's no proof of that.  Men lie women lie. People who don't use foresight will always use hindsight. Use foresight. There's one thing if she has it and didn't tell you and you contracted it but if she told you and you still went along any way and then contracted it you have no one to blame but yourself. 

If you're a man and you don't have hsv only date someone with it if you're going to marry them. And have sex only after marriage. That's just my 2 cents",2022-03-26 14:37:12,0

toiibc,">he really doesn’t want to get herpes

He already has herpes, just not the strain you have. Don't let that comment go without challenging it. 

If you take antivirals, and avoid sex during an outbreak, there is a 2% chance of transmission per year, assuming sex 2-3x a week. If you add condoms to that, it's 1% per year. Statistically, this is not significant. 

I understand it's his choice, but you also have a choice. If it's making you feel like he doesn't accept you, and he says maybe condoms forever, you have the right to say, ""No, this doesn't work for me."" 

After 2 years, he has a pretty good idea if he wants this relationship to go the distance, unless you all are maybe 20, and maybe then he'll still know. If he's in it for the long haul, then what difference will it make if he gets hsv2 at 40, and you all are still together? 

You absolutely can decide for yourself if condomless sex is something you require at some point in your life. I mean, that's how babies are made, if that's something that applies to you, and you desire. (You don't mention your genders/ages.) 

I'd definitely have an issue with it in an LTR. For sure.",2022-03-26 10:23:42,2
toiibc,"I guess I would wonder how children / family will factor in if condoms forever. And you being on antivirals and the lower transmission rate from female to male .

How are you supposed to ever relax and have good sex if everyone is worried about bodies touching? I can't imagine that makes you feel good.

tnqpn4,Can anyone back this up?,2022-03-25 18:18:07,1

But they almost always looked like ingrown hairs untill started leaking but even then they were always small and even before leaking did not look like a full on circle. The ones on the picture look somewhat closer to warts to me. I have genital warts too btw. Not that I'm saying they're warts on the pic but I feel like showing this to people might lead them to wrong self diagnose if looks different. 

My ex now who gave it to me also only had them looking like the pic but when passed to me looked like a few ingrown hairs. Like spots almost. He was trynna convince me it's not herpes until 2 days after I've got some myself alongside with pain🤷‍♀️.",2022-03-25 22:38:00,2

to5f47,A fwb but it was more than that. We loved spending time together. We talk very often about life and are really vulnerable with eachother. I understand he was seeing other people but he came to see me in the new city I live and the fact he didn’t think to get tested before he came to see me is so disrespectful. I’m ending things regardless of the results. I’m a bit nervous because what if it was dormant in me and sex just triggered it? But at the same time we’ve been doing this for almost 2 years and this hasn’t happened ever until now. Literally 3 days after he left I had what I thought was a bad yeast infection until blisters started appearing.

to4nkr,That I have no idea. Both HSV 1 & 2 can be found orally or genital. You won’t know location until you have a OB. Which you maybe never will. But unfortunately that doesn’t mean you don’t still spread it. You can pass it even without a OB.,2022-03-26 00:04:52,1

to4flj,Like everything was normal before her then after I couldn’t have sex from the pain then and she thought she wasn’t attractive too me but it was the pain pull my foreskin back and seen the sore now my penis is inflamed and red I for the antibiotics now also so maybe it will go away soon but it’s forever ugh,2022-03-25 23:59:24,1
to4flj,It could possibly be genital HSV1 (from the oral) but you have to wait for results… but you don’t really know …. And just remember it’s not usually tested in STI panels in general… so either of them could have HSV1 or 2 …. I suggest for them to both get tested by actually requesting HSV testing not just state STI. It’s best to find out who is also positive to protect themselves and future partners…. The first outbreak is the most painful from what I’ve read (31f first OB was in February) but i would take warm baths to help because i just couldn’t sleep at one point,2022-03-26 01:51:08,1
to4flj,I think it is it started showing after my gf gave me oral we had sex plenty of times but when she started giving me oral this appeared,2022-03-26 02:56:04,1

tnldvb,People are so ignorant and violent towards us HSV+ folks. I am of the opinion that disclosure is your choice  and you're not wrong for not disclosing. They weren't going to ask if you if you had it or not so why is the onus on you? Most people who have herpes have no idea who have it and spread it like wildfire so why are we the ones who have to disclose when we are managing our symptoms and actually doing things to protect our partners? I will say that I typically choose to disclose because I think honesty is the best policy but people are cruel and it is a safety issue especially for women. Disclose if you want to or don't it's your decision.,2022-03-25 16:21:30,7

I have GHSV1 and never took meds my first year was a bit rocky but I haven’t had an outbreak in 5 full years. GHSV1 has an EXTREMELY low tranmission rate and I have never passed it to a partner. Also if anyof your partners have had a cold sore in their life they are immune to your herpes because they already have the antibodies for hsv-1

tnw5gp,"When it comes to HSV I definitely think education is a big factor in overcoming a lot of things that may be going through someone's head. When I was diagnosed about a month ago I was in major panic, wasn't too educated and had no idea what was going on. Hardly slept for 2 weeks but during that time I read up on it, watched YouTube videos, looked here on reddit and got support from family and friends. All of these truly helped alleviate the questions I had. Found out some close family friends of mine have had HSV for a good amount of their lives and what they did themselves to suppress and overcome the virus. 

My little sister has a friend who has had it since middle school (15+ years) takes the daily anti suppressant viral, takes supplements such as L-Lysine, Red Marine Algae and Zinc to help boost the immune system since having a low immune system is when HSV typically seems to erupt. She doesn't eat high Arginine foods anymore such as nuts, oats and quite a bit of other food groups. She works out 3-4 times a week, has a boyfriend of 3 years and they have unprotected sex all the time and he has yet to get the virus. He gets checked once or twice a year. She hasn't had an OB in over 6 years.  
The other two family friends that I know of have had it for 25+ years, live normal lives and have an OB MAYBE once a year, if that. They have a normal sex life, both are married with spouses that also have not gotten the virus and they don't really do much other than taking the daily viral suppressant. They live normal lives, have kids and they both have reassured me that they honestly don't even think about having HSV anymore. Now obviously everyone's body reacts to this differently.  
Here are some pretty awesome informational videos that I found while digging through Youtube. Maybe show some of these to her if they helped educate you as well?

And last but not least I found another very informational food chart that shows Lysine v Arginine intakes. L-Lysine is an amino acid that MAY cut the occurrence, severity, and duration of herpes outbreaks. Why? Well, it has to do with another amino acid: Arginine.  
Back in the 60s, researchers showed that elevated arginine levels in the human diet made herpes outbreaks worse. It turns out the herpes virus needs arginine to replicate.  
So what does lysine have to do with it? Simple. Lysine and arginine compete for absorption in the body.  
The idea is that you want to consume more lysine in your diet than arginine. Then you’ve taken a step to reduce the amount of herpes virus that replicates in your system. Once the reproduction of herpes simplex virus is stopped or minimized, it could reduce the duration and frequency of a herpes outbreak. 

And here's that food chart that shows High Lysine and High Arginine food groups; [https://healingcycles.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/lysine\_arginine\_foods.pdf](https://healingcycles.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/lysine_arginine_foods.pdf)

Let me know if you have any other questions, I am fairly new into the diagnosis so I am still learning everyday but it seems the best thing is to figure out your triggers and cut those specific things out of your life to help reduce the chances of causing an OB. If there's mental issues I have heard from many people on here that going to therapy is HUGE or working out a few times a week really helps as well. I started going to a gym myself this week and I have got to say my anxiety and overthinking has really suppressed since going. Hope this helps and good luck to you and her! You guys got this, everything will be okay.",2022-03-27 16:26:24,2

tnmcm3,"I will say I’ve had a lot of what is this bump scares in the past. My initial herpes outbreak was surprising in that it wasn’t bumps I first noticed. It was intense pain, nausea, and other flu like symptoms. The cluster when it did appear (after I was in enough pain to warrant 2 urgent cares and the emergency room) was on my hip.

I say this not to gatekeep but to encourage you not to freakout about little skin problems. If you see clusters or experience pain then this should encourage you to see a doctor and get tested. 

Having lived with it for a few months now my perspective is: the first outbreak was the worst experience of my life, I wasted too much stress worrying over small bumps in the past, and only I can let myself have feelings of shame. Knowing I have it and have gotten through the worst I feel surprisingly free with the exception I am adamant about safe sex now.",2022-03-25 18:16:30,1

If it doesn't work out it just doesn't. 🤷🏾‍♀️ I understand the financial part but when you get back into the groove, please start to build yourself up again and get out.

tn9ixp,"You’re not stuck in this relationship, your fear of the unknown is what’s keeping you in your current relationship. Relationships are hard and with the introduction of an incurable (for now) skin infection with a stigma attached to it you probably fear rejection of new potential partners. If it’s so bad with your current partner then leave and never return. 

I had a coworker who was in her late 50’s who would always complain about her husband cheating on her and I’d say the usual “I’m sorry to hear that”. One night we were both alone at work (we worked in a psych hospital) she brought it up again and I had a serious conversation with her. I asked her why would she stay married to a man who had a history of cheating on her so often and she admitted she was scared to leave because she was so old. I looked at her and told her she was old enough to be my mother and happiness/misery are options we chose in life. I told her that her husband cheats because he knows she’ll never leave and if she wanted to change her life she had to take action and break that cycle by removing herself from it. She agreed but guess what she’s still with him and still complains. 

The point is this is your life and you have the power to change it, but that takes effort. I’m sure you can make a clean break from this guy and finally create the happiness you’re looking for.

I thought I was alone and when I started to disclose to the people close to me they told me they either knew someone who has herpes or even dated or hooked up with someone with herpes.

I’m in my 20s. I actually met my now bf through bumble and before him I disclosed to three others whom still wanted to pursue or sleep with me!

Ppl don't rlly care about hsv tbf

But then again, the only ppl that actually need to know r ur partners or anyone u getting intimate wth, or doctors ! ~

Also idk the the story of how this came about or who ur partner is but hsv can happen to anyone at any age, sometimes unintentionally. e.g it can be passed even if they've never had symptoms before so they're unaware they have it, ppl can get it even if protection is used, babies and young kids can get it just from an innocent kiss etc . But if he knew he had it and didn't disclose beforehand then yh that's sucky",2022-03-25 12:57:36,3
tn9ixp,Listen I understand how you feel. I felt the same when I first found out and I stayed with someone who was no better for my mental health. But stress is a trigger as to a lot of things. I get it it feel like the end but it’s not. It’s actually really common and some people really don’t care cause they contracted it when they were just a kid by kissing or drink of there parents. Also no one really knows their hsv status because the don’t test in std screening unless you are having an outbreak. I am in my 20s so I understand but with hook up culture there probably quite a few people you know in you life that have stds and like normal life’s take it one day at a time. And remember there are people out there that don’t care because it isn’t harmful to your health. It’s just a stigma but in reality you can have a health relationship with out even contacting it. Take lysing everyday it really prevents and multi vitamin. You can look up alternative medications on Amazon I heard are good. Or talk to your doctor and you can get on a pill that helps prevent outbreaks and even passing it on.,2022-03-25 04:28:59,2

I stayed another two years with my ex boyfriend fearing no one else would want me. It was so hard to come to terms with it. But now I’m with my current boyfriend of 2 years, he was okay that I had herpes. I’m 20 now and a lot more confident in my diagnosis. Once you come to terms with it. It becomes easier to live with. I’m extremely open to people that I have herpes and it was reassuring to hear friends and other people have it as well. This is not the end of the world like it feels now for you. It does get better and it’s not even an issue anymore (I’ve had 3 outbreaks in since I found out). I’m here to talk if you need. Good luck!",2022-03-25 09:50:51,2

Because the price of your happiness and worth is what matters. vs, the price your going to pay after staying.. I literally left my husband who has raped me continuously..   Dealt with a bunch of really shitty things. And then got hsv from receiving oral from a girl, like 4 months ago.  Honestly. You will be loved. You will come out from this stronger. This is a big/ yet small part of our lives.     Also. If you can’t even afford to be alone. Girl. You can, I’m a part time single mom and I work 80 hours a week to sustain my life. Grow balls tell him to fuck off and that your so much more worthy. I hope you get to a point that you’ll look back at this time of your life.. and be like “fuck that was shitty. But I don’t tolerate that shit anymore..”


Also in my 20’s :)

Also. I’m extremely open about it. I don’t care what people think of me - there’s 8 billion people on earth. Fuck people’s opinions of something only you are going to be dealing with for the rest of your life.

I usually say “ I have hsvg1- which is genital herpes”. And I usually send off a link. Mostly dating done online these days so I’d rather get it out in the open. Herpes doesn’t discount me as a strong, beautiful, independent woman. And honestly. The people that wouldn’t chance it aren’t the people for me 😅 dm me any time",2022-03-25 12:45:15,2
tn9ixp,"I was 25 when I contracted it. I was with two people prior to my husband (one a fling one a serious boyfriend) both were cool with it and we stayed safe. They were mature and understanding. I met my husband at 27. The moment I met him I knew he was going to be the one I was going to marry. So I went ahead and told him the night I met him. Never done that before. But I laid all my cards on the table and said “hey this is me” but my sti doesn’t define me. He also was super cool about it. I am now 32 been married to him for 3 years and we have a 2 year old. 

You’re not stuck in your relationship love. You’re stuck in your head. I was there once. It took me a year to get used to the idea about dating again and telling people. Don’t let it take that long for you. Seek counseling or even a support group because I promise you’re not alone. There are a lot of people out there that are more understanding than you think. 

Yes, I have been rejected only one time because of it. But I’m glad because obviously that guy wasn’t right for me.

tn9ixp,"Please please don't stay anywhere that you do not want to be just because of herpes. I know things seem bleak and hopeless and the thought of being alone with this seems like the worst option ever. However that is the stigma talking and not the truth. You can find so many fulfilling partners who couldn't care less about herpes. I got herpes at 19 and I consider myself lucky looking back on it that the person who gave it to me dumped me. Because like you the fear of being alone would have forced me to stay in that horrible relationship. I am now 28 and have had over 25 partners (some serious relationships others just hook ups) and at first disclosing was hard but after a few you begin to realize so many people do not care, and the people that do care tend to be walking red flags in so many other ways. You are not alone 1 in 6 14-65 year olds have genital herpes. There are so many of us out here living our best life.

I only stayed in that relationship out of fear of the dating world and not loving myself enough. When that relationship ended I was terrified but here I am a year later in one of the happiest relationships I’ve ever been in. He accepted me & my herpes. And yes I did hook up with other people in between and they also didn’t care. It’s all about the way you disclose and loving yourself and who you are is so much more than having herpes. 

Please please do not stay in this relationship. I promise you it’s so much better being single and finding out how to love yourself again is so much better than staying in a relationship out of fear. You are strong. You can date. You can message me if you need anything ❤️",2022-03-25 17:06:39,2

We would see each other etc fool around but he straight up told me afterwards that he couldn't be with someone who had herpes like he didn't want to get it which it is understandable, he did seem paranoid asf after we would have sex. Anyways I ended up having major depression like it was literally my last straw but thankfully my sister checked up on me next morning. I thought no one will want me for having herpes ever and I had low self esteem, this happened at the beginning of 2020 so during the pandemic I was working, in school and got myself a treadmill and I just started working on myself. I told myself I didn't NEED anyone and that it is okay to be alone and if someone truly loved me they will accept me for who I am and if they don't then it's w.e. Theres billions of people in this planet. I'm currently in a relationship with a great guy and at first it took me a while to open up cus I was in a dark place. My advice to you is to get out of the relationship clearly you aren't happy, try to work on yourself IT IS HARD, but you can do it, focus on yourself and if you meet someone ALWAYS open up about your status! Remember you aren't the only person with HSV, there are plenty of us! Like you said you are young! So much ahead of you!",2022-03-25 14:30:15,1
tn9ixp,"One of the first things I read on this sub when I joined, which made an impact on me for other reasons, is: ""Herpes isn't a bad enough reason to avoid a good relationship, and it isn't a good enough reason to stay in a bad relationship."" 

My partner is GHSV2+ and I tested negative for both types when we started dating. We've been exclusive for several months, and we are fortunate that they are asymptomatic and take a daily antiviral. I researched the condition and educated myself on the risks, and found that they were not a big deal compared to the quality of the person I had found. So, yes, you can - and *will* - find someone who accepts your dx AND treats you like you deserve to be treated. You just need to be proactive for your health, be honest with the people that need to know, and have confidence that your value as a human is in no way diminished by this condition.

HSV-1 IS ALSO COMMON IN GENITALS!! so 11% of the world has HSV2 and 67% of the world has HSV1(which can be both oral and genitals and there is no way a blood test can tell you where it is!) So actually, 78% have oral and genital herpes as HSV2 can also go to the mouth. A d keep in mind that not a lot of people test for herpes which is why scientists say that the expect it to be at least 90%",2022-03-25 15:57:10,1
tn9ixp,"I was gifted by my 21 y/o boyfriend when I was 17(f). I was so devastated and accepted I just had to stay with him forever. With that mindset, I moved halfway across the country away from everyone I knew and allowed him to mistreat and abuse me. I felt like no one else would love or accept me and that’s the best I could get. F that!!!! I figured it was better to even be alone than be miserable. And even better, I’d say half of people do not care! It’s all about confidence, being educated, and how you disclose. If you start off with, “I have a horrible STD called herpes” and speak negatively, that’s how they’ll react. If you tell them, “I was diagnosed with herpes and get cold sores, this is an extremely common skin condition. This is how I prevent transmission, and here are the statistics on transmission rates.” Keep it open and positive.

tndi5n,"If you're waiting until after the sores have scabbed then it's certainly possible the swab could come back negative. Swabs need to be done ASAP before healing starts as sometimes the virus is no longer present on the skin by the point scabs have formed.

Did he not test for other things like chanchroid, syphilis? Could it just be an infected cut which led to a bacterial infection in the area?

At this point, if you do not have further skin outbreaks, your best bet would be to wait 12 weeks and then take another IgG bloodtest.

If it comes back positive for hsv1 then, well you already know you have had cold sores since a kid so it's highly unlikely you have hsv1 genitally contracted recently. If it comes back as positive for both hsv1 and hsv2 then you will know you most likely have hsv2 genitally.

You will have to wait some weeks before the test though since your antibodies will not show up if it's a recent infection. The good news is the false negative chance for hsv2 is much, much lower than hsv1, so you can be reasonably sure if it comes back as negative after 12 weeks and you've had a negative swab, that you probably don't have hsv2. The Western Blot is much more accurate though and would be the definitive test to use.",2022-03-25 15:52:45,3

tmftit,Get tested Maybe you don’t have it you can’t self diagnose it’s very tricky it happened to me kept tripping for a month and was so “Sure” did a test came back negative but it surely still had an effect on me and I will keep supporting this community forever❤️,2022-03-24 16:14:24,3
tmftit,Thank you guys for all your messages. I would like to say to the people who have commented and messaged me. Really the only thing I couldn’t wrap my head around is I know people will 20+ bodies but I had the luck of catching hsv my first time dang. Life is life🤷🏽‍♀️,2022-03-24 18:55:05,3
tmftit,"It's impressive to seem a young person take it in the most mature way posible.  It happened for a reason , people weren't careful enough. So we may as well embrace the fact it was a mistake and try to live with it because like u said.  It won't kill you and when the time come someone who'll truly love you will not care you've herpes and still accept you the way you're.  💯",2022-03-24 15:13:11,2
tmftit,I really needed to hear this. I was diagnosed end of last month and I’ve been super depressed and hating myself. I absolutely love your outlook on all of this. Thank you for sharing ❤️,2022-03-24 16:56:40,2
tmftit,"F/19 Literally same situation. Caught it when I was 17 after my first time. Glad too see you pull through so fast :) It took months of lying in bed being depressed and suicidal for me, but now I don't even think about it anymore and doesn't affect my life really, there's real problems to worry about. And yeah, people do make it seem like a bigger deal than it really is.",2022-03-24 17:07:52,1
tmftit,RIGHT! Even if it is negative ima still be up in this groups comments and supporting everyone. I’m kinda too scared to check I’ve developed a mentality now and honestly don’t know what to do if it did come negative but I do have an appointment for a blood test next week:) wish me luck!,2022-03-24 16:15:59,5
tmftit,Exactly. Life is life things happen for a reason,2022-03-24 15:14:07,3

tnbt5j,"I have been in a sexual relationship with someone who is hsv-2 positive for about 3 years now and have also had this issue. We have protected sex and sometimes non protected but nothing to crazy, I have never developed anything on my shaft or head however I have developed small to large cyst like boils around my groin area.

tnbt5j,"I would go for a second opinion. My first outbreak, The first doctor I went to was my family dr and she would not take me seriously and tried telling me it was chlamydia even though I was arguing with her to test me for hsv. The symptoms did not align with chlamydia, but they did with herpes. I went to a community health clinic and they agreed with me that it did look like hsv, and even though the sores were almost dry and they said it might not come back conclusive but they still tried and were able to confirm with me that it was after they got the results back. You want to get tested for many reasons. For closure for yourself so you can learn to accept it. To protect and educate yourself and your current or future partners. HSV and HPV are very simular symptoms in terms of they both cause lesions/warts. Hsv doesn't really have long term physical health effects besides being annoying and painful during outbreaks,  and the frequency often lessons over time. Hpv can have more serious long term health effects such as cancer, the risks associated can be lessoned significantly if caught early, so it's best to advocate and get another opinion.

tmel6s,"And that’s completely fair to not want to talk to them after that. If she told her boyfriend who she knows that you hate without your permission then that’s a violation of trust and shouldn’t be taken lightly. Also, that’s ridiculous that your so called “friends” would put that type of pressure on you when you go out. You disclose whenever you feel it’s appropriate. You clearly know way more about Hsv than them considering her boyfriend thinks he got it from a water fountain 😂 … but seriously, it sounds like you need to let this girl go or explain to her how hurtful her actions are.",2022-03-24 15:00:11,19
tmel6s,"what jerks. are you fucking them then and there in public?? then they should keep their mouths closed. im sorry youre being treated that way. people are treating me differently too, but if someone ever told me how to handle my disease (while being misinformed at that), i'd have some strong words for em. gHSV1 isnt even that big of a deal, transmission/shedding wise. your friend would have contracted it if her man was any good in bed. LOL",2022-03-24 16:45:51,7
tmel6s,"I stopped talking to my best friend over her alcoholic boyfriend at that age. She actually stopped talking to me as I was definitely fine with her as a person, just sick of cleaning up her boyfriends puke...

Anyway, 12 years later and we are happily living together ^_^ perhaps ya'll need a break, herpes issue or not?",2022-03-24 15:22:29,5
tmel6s,First of all it’s YOUR decision when to disclose. Not anyone else’s. I would talk to her separately and bring up the fact that your told her this in confidence (why the fuck did she tell her man) and that it’s not on their part to pressure you in telling the whole world. If she fights back in any way tbh it’s not worth arguing. A true friend would respect the boundary placed,2022-03-24 15:45:08,3
tmel6s,You are well within your right to not to tell anyone you dont feel comfortable knowing.,2022-03-24 16:07:05,4
tmel6s,This is exactly why I have never told a single soul friend/family wise. If they get mad at you or something they always have it to use against you.,2022-03-24 17:48:49,3
tmel6s,That’s no longer your friend,2022-03-24 17:49:42,3
tmel6s,"What the actual fuck? Why did she fee the need to tell her bf? Not cool, first of all. Secondly, sounds like they have some stigma around STIs to unlearn. Did bf disclose to every person he ever kissed on the lips/cheek/gave oral to? Doubt it.",2022-03-24 19:51:28,2
tmel6s,This is NOT a friend! Cut her off! Last August before I moved out of state I told my best friend of 10 years about my hsv2. We were watching suicide squad we were alone in the theater and as soon as the movie got done (we had been drinking) I looked over at her and came out about it. She didnt judge me at all. I had been wanting to tell her for years. I'm sorry you're going though this but you deserve better friends.,2022-03-24 18:43:58,1
tmel6s,"Tell them how you feel and if they still keep up the toxic behavior, you don’t need people like that in your life. Sorry you’re going through that, you deserve better",2022-03-24 21:18:42,1
tmel6s,Ew these sound like awful people. You should have friends that lift you up and make you feel good and ok. All my friends have been 100% supportive and reassure me how insignificant this is. You should cut them off or talk to them,2022-03-24 21:33:41,1
tmel6s,"Sounds like she is not a great friend. Unfortunately it's through these experiences that we learn who we can and cannot trust. Take it as a lesson learnt but don't let it make you jaded about trusting people. If you value this person, maybe consider talking to her about how this has made you feel. If she's a decent person and worth having in your life she will apologise and you can try to both move forward from this. If she doesn't respect what you have to say and how you feel, she was not worth keeping as a best friend. People come and go in our lives, just because you were good for each other then does not mean you'll be good for each other for the future. Sorry you have had to go through this. It gets better",2022-03-24 21:48:26,1
tmel6s,The thing is if this person is a special as you say she is and you don’t wasn’t to completely loose her then it’s ok to creat some distance between the two of you . Also maybe not give them the scoop when you’re interested in someone if that’s how they react. Tell that person when your good and ready and comfortable to do so. Don’t let them pressure you into doing something your not ready to .,2022-03-24 23:12:51,1
tmel6s,"Just going to throw this out there bc I haven’t seen this yet posted, but does your friend know she runs the risk of contracting hsv from her bf? Regardless of hsv type, it presents itself both orally and genitally. He can pass it to her genitally by performing oral sex. 

Seems like your friend and her bf aren’t educated on hsv. The stigma surrounding hsv is just sad. I recommend telling them that they should do more research on hsv and they will learn a lot, including that sti screening is not done for herpes. In fact, per CDC website, “There is no evidence that diagnosing genital herpes with a blood test in someone without symptoms would change their sexual behavior and stop the virus from spreading. In addition, without knowing the benefits of testing, the risk of shaming and stigmatizing people outweighs the potential benefits.”  A lot of people have it and don’t know it. The stigma surrounding herpes should be changed.",2022-03-25 01:28:05,1
tmel6s,"Sounds like this is not a safe, healthy friendship. If I were in your shoes, I would cut her out of my life. It's not okay that she told her boyfriend. Huge trust violation. It's also not okay for them to pressure you into telling anyone you have HSV. It's hard and painful when a friendship ends but they are harming and hampering your romantic life with that bullshit.",2022-03-25 03:16:28,1
tmel6s,I've been thinking about it. Ever since they got together our relationship has been strained. It's just she was there for me when my boyfriend died and when I was living on my own at 16 and I was there when her parents died. It just seems like a shame to throw that away,2022-03-24 17:01:30,2
tmel6s,"I know it was really frustrating to have them shame me when they don't even know what they're talking about. This is MY virus and I spent months researching everything about it. I'm a science student, I know how to inform myself on something. ""Ok but you should still tell them, I'd want to know"" ok... He has oral herpes (apparently) I've never seen him tell anyone once before sharing a drink or food with someone? But because mine is down south I'm a terrible person?",2022-03-24 17:08:01,3
tmel6s,Lmao. Good observation 🤣,2022-03-24 19:45:50,2

tmel6s,"Yeah I've basically asked her to never bring it up again. Even if it's just me and her. I told her I wish I'd never told her anything, which I think hurt her feelings. And I kind of hope it did. If she continues I think I'll have to cut it off. As much as I don't want to.",2022-03-24 17:04:43,3
tmel6s,"Yeah I thought the same thing. He share drinks and cigarettes with people he doesn't even know all the time. It's only because mine is down south that I'm ""different"" ITS THE SAME THING",2022-03-24 21:12:24,1
tmel6s,"Yeah they know, the reason they do this to me is so ""I don't spread it"". I haven't even slept with anyone since my diagnosis and I'm still trying to deal with that part. But they've done this so many times already. It's hypothetical and thats one of the worst parts",2022-03-25 03:02:51,1
tmel6s,I understand completely but sometimes we have to let go of people who no longer have our best interests. I have multiple childhood friends that I’ve completely cut contact with because I realized they were no longer healthy for me at this point in my life and it sounds like your friend is very immature and does not care about your emotional well-being. Nobody that cares about you would treat you like that. It’s immature and super disrespectful.,2022-03-24 18:06:03,5
tmel6s,"I’ve been having issues with my best friend lately. Honestly, if you have issues, just create some distance and only see them once in a while. That’s what I’ve been doing. I know eventually we will be on the same page again. No use in throwing it away, but taking some space is important.",2022-03-25 01:13:38,1
tmel6s,Some friendships last like this... I also let go of a BFF at 22 (since kindergarten) and tried to rekindle it but nope. So... It's ok. You'll end up with more friends than you ever imagined by the time you're 30.,2022-03-24 21:11:51,2
tmel6s,Yeah i mean you confided in her and she broke that trust. If she is butthurt about it then let her be. Just remember you’re not in the wrong for placing that boundary with her. Fortunately having HSV weeds out people that don’t have our best interest at heart.,2022-03-24 17:29:20,2
tmel6s,Why do they care so much about when you disclose? That’s such a personal choice that people need to make themselves. Makes me think they are projecting in some way- maybe they still believe the false narrative surrounding hsv that a lot of the world still believes. I don’t know. It’s weird they do that to you. My friends know I have it and when I am with someone new they do not tell me when to tell the person my status. Because I’m an adult and I don’t let other people make choices for me. I would let your friend and her bf know that they are crossing your boundary when they give their two cents. Let them know you do not want unsolicited advice on the subject. Hope it gets better.,2022-03-25 03:10:10,1
tmel6s,Sometimes the reality of it all is just difficult. I appreciate you being straightforward and realistic about it.,2022-03-24 18:35:43,3
tmel6s,"You hit the nail right on the head with that one. A little over a year ago I cut one of my best friends off who I have been friends with since childhood. We are both 34 and have been friends with each other since we were 5. It was over the capital riots and I posted something about it and she was basically like ""if this is how you feel I don't want to be your friend anymore"" my mom called her out and she deleted my mom. I deleted her off my fb and havent talked to her since. I broke my ankle the next day so I'm not sure if that was karma or not but regardless I don't really want to be friends with someone like that anyway. I also cut 2 other childhood friends off back in 2015 because one was being a complete asshole to me when my family moved to Arizona and left me to be a single mom on my own. They were my support system with my son and I was struggling with his behavior and having no help. She basically told me to suck it up instead of being understanding and supportive. Cut another one off for being a straight up insane person when it came to political stuff. We obviously don't agree and she's not one of those people who can agree to disagree, she always wanted to be right.",2022-03-24 18:49:38,1

Just because he only gets them in his nose does not mean he isn’t shedding from his mouth. I got my ghsv1 from someone who has no memory of ever getting cold sores and tested positive for hsv1 so an asymptomatic individual who was shedding from his mouth. 
I am.. and you should too (if you’d like of course) will not be kissing for about 4/5 months 😳 to try and prevent oshv1 while building up antibodies.",2022-03-25 04:51:52,3

tndz9c,No. It would not make a difference. The waiting suggestion is more for your protection. It’s totally possible to continue kissing and you not get it.. but it’s also totally possible for you to get. Especially since your body is currently trying to fight it off now. It’s really just your personal decision. If you’re cool with the possibility of getting oshv1 which I assume so since you have been together a bit and I’m sure kissed a bunch .. then continue the make out seshes!

I couldn't concentrate on anything. It'd last from 5 mins to half an hour and if it happened once a day it'd happen again over and over the same day. It would like ""shoot"" me every few sec-mins.

I'm on amitriptyline 20mg daily for pain relief 2 pills. Been on them for months now. Does help to feel it less for sure. Tried going off of it coz I was like hmm how much worse can it get coz I forgot... . Was a very bad decision. I was dying. Over the counter does NOTHING.

We're strong!! And if they feel too bad go to the doctors after diagnosis to get on pills. They offer different antidepressants for nerve pain relief. Helps to sleep too :). I only get bad dry mouth from them but they help me sleep and manage pain so I'll take that haha. 

I'm in UK and here the first thing that's offered is amitriptyline which is what I'm on. They say it's one of the best things they have to help with it soo hopefully you can get your hands on some.",2022-03-25 23:00:53,2

I will say this, experts says that you should likely wait about 7-10 days after and outbreak clears to be sexually active, so I’d say maybe go based on that rule and assume at least 7 days.

tmfsdt,"So scientifically there is a stigma due the the purity movement which led to a lack of education about sex and STIs. They preaches abstinence in its place using scare tactics to frighten people to not have sex then the HIV/AIDS epidemic happened furthering the fear of STDs and STIs as a whole. 

How we can end it is by educating others in our lives not just partners but friends and family as well. Another way to combat it is to stop treating it as if it’s a huge embarrassing secret and being more open with your diagnosis if every person who had a form of herpes was public honest and open we outnumber those who do not have it. I understand that not everyone is in that comfortable place in life with their diagnosis but until we get there the stigma will always exist. 

If you are not comfortable being open one thing you can do is anytime you hear someone using stigma language or making a herpes joke is to politely correct him without outing yourself. What are usually do in total settings where I’m not comfortable with everyone knowing my herpes status if I hear a herpes or STD joke like “oh my god did you hear that girl got herpes from a toilet seat” 
I pretend to be stupid and go “oh my god can you really get herpes that way?” And I make a big production about Googling Herpes in front of them and I go “guys you can’t get it that way also did you know one and six people have it and most people don’t even know look!” “Wow that’s crazy!!!” And do little things like that this way at the end of the day the person who made the joke knows that their joke is not only not funny but it’s also in accurate.

I really like your doctor - he's rational and logical. We don't see a lot of those here. :)

I was in a relationship with an hsv2+ man for several years before I got it. (I'm female.) We didn't use anything, just avoided sex during outbreaks. I do not regret it. The relationship didn't work out, but my life has been fine since. 

I always say that herpes isn't a good enough reason to stay in a bad relationship, or leave a good one. As you already know, there are a lot of people with hsv2 out there. If you decline to be with her, the next woman you date might have it, not know it or not disclose it, and you might get it.

Condoms conservatively reduce the risk by another 50% (with both condoms and antivirals it's 2.5%) but Teri Warren's research suggests that condoms may reduce transmission by 90-96%, putting your risk at well under 1% per year if y'all have sex approximately 2-3 times a week.

tm48wt,"I can share my experience a little bit to possibly ease your concerns. I was diagnosed 3 years ago after my ex cheated on me. I was devastated and did like you said, did what I could to prevent outbreaks and at this point it's no different from pimples imo, so yes the stigma is a little silly.

In terms of dating, think of it like a magnet! It'll definitely push away a lot of people, but it will also pull the ones with a deep attraction towards you. In my own experience, yes, I did experience a lot of negative comments, neutral and positive comments in dating. For me it was probably the majority of people. Buuuut, do you think you could even be in a happy relationship long term with a majority of people? absolutely not! So who cares if the people who wouldn't have been that great anyway latch onto it. In my experience, if they're someone who's completely turned away by hsv immediately, then if it wasn't hsv, they would've found some other thing to latch on to.

I met my current girlfriend 1.5 years ago and after a while of talking, I felt it was necessary to inform her. She was pretty much just like, ""oh ok, that's whatever, I still like you for you"". She asked a couple of question out of curiosity, but at no point showed any judgment and was just more excited to be with me. Moral of the story, someone who isn't accepting of your hsv diagnosis when you tell them is a great way to see the good in someone. You'll find the people who don't look at you in disgust, but continue to see you exactly the same are the people you want to keep around. Hsv is but an incredibly small segment of our life, there's still a whole universe of thought and life behind that diagnosis, so seriously, don't let others make you feel as if hsv is who you are.

Also, for reference as this group is for educating one another m compelled to give some advice. never trust another couple in the lifestyle, no matter what. The first rule is to see paperwork beforehand. Most couples in the lifestyle go in knowing the risk and most will not cough up the extra money for a 10 panel, so that won't prove hsv/HPV/hepatitis status. . Second rule is never unprotected. Couples can engage in high risk behavior and are not obligated to tell other couples every detail of their adventures.

tn7029,"ok yeah i didnt know if the slight uptick in the HSV1 from the most recent test maybe had something to do with a new HSV2 infection.  

I meant by if she sucked some dudes dick before me with GHSV2 on it, or even kissed him with OHSV2, then contracted OHSV2, maybe thats what was on her lip when I kissed her I guess....",2022-03-24 22:39:37,1
tn7029,"She may or may not have ohsv2 , if she has a blister / sore on her lip then it wouldn’t be something she had just acquired, there is incubation periods . Chances are she didn’t have ohsv2 .  But to note that condoms do cut the risk of hsv but do not eliminate it completely as they don’t cover the whole genital area.",2022-03-24 22:54:36,1
tn49kb,"I can’t help you with some of this because I truly have no idea, I’m new to this all myself. But I will say if you preform oral on someone else you could give them GHSV1, Even without sores. I got it from my partner who has OHSV1 and didn’t know, meaning no sores ever or when we were intimate. So that is definitely possible. I also know that if they preform oral on you, you could give them OHSV2 but I think those numbers are lower but I’m not entirely sure. I think since you’ve had it for awhile you have enough antibodies that will keep you from getting OHSV2 . Again I’m not entirely sure about it all because I’m new to this too but Just sharing my experience",2022-03-25 00:12:30,2
tn49kb,Yolo bro. Get out there and liv,2022-03-25 08:45:31,2
tn49kb,Thank you for your input! At least it’s something. I’m on my second day of valacyclovir in anticipation of the trip as well. Should’ve included that in my post,2022-03-25 00:15:17,1

tn3zft,"Very good point, thank you 🙏",2022-03-24 21:43:17,1
tn3e3m,It is your first ob so I’d recommend taking it for a couple more days. Some people take it as daily med to keep it away up to you and how you feel about meds and how many obs you get,2022-03-24 21:37:16,1
tn3e3m,"Did they not do a swab if you had an active OB. ? Ghsv can be 1 or 2 .  If your igg came back positive then your hsv 1 isn’t a new infection , have you had oral cold sores in the past ?",2022-03-24 22:39:12,1
tn3e3m,I would take another lab test elsewhere to be certain before taking any medications. Sometimes lab tests can give a false positive or negative.,2022-03-24 23:19:48,1
tmws24,Don't ever let herpes keep you with someone you don't want to be with,2022-03-24 19:35:03,1

tm2wcv,Thank you for compiling this information,2022-03-29 02:03:07,2
tmr7xf,"I don’t know the correct answer to this but I do have a suggestion. Work on this habit. 
“IF I bite my lips and have open wounds and am bleeding, THEN I can’t give oral which I loooooveee” and actually follow this new rule. Put it on a sticky note and stick it by your mirror for viewing. Make a reminder on your phone that reminds you of this in the morning or every few hours. Hsv or not .. this doesn’t seem like a good habit.",2022-03-24 18:13:45,3
tmr7xf,"If you have had ghsv2 for a year then you will already have antibodies to protect you from further infection. It's very unlikely for you to get it in another location once you have antibodies, so I would say you're safe.

Also hsv2 does not like to live orally so your chances are even less likely.

Lastly, as you have hsv2 your body now has protection against hsv1. Hsv1 infection following hsv2 infection is currently believed to be extremely unlikely.",2022-03-25 16:12:31,2
tmr7xf,Thanks for the tip. It’s not something I’m really consciously aware of. Usually I am just applying minty chapstick multiple times a day because then when I bite I taste it and it’s my cue to cut it out. I also posted on Terri Warren forum so I’ll update with the answer for people in the future.,2022-03-24 19:40:02,2
tmr7xf,Thank you so much! I also asked Terri on her forum and she said the same thing. I feel so much better about it. All the oral sex for me 🤪,2022-03-25 19:50:01,2

tmq12c,Rates of transmission on valacyclovir unprotected m2f is 5% a year if you have sex 2 times a week.,2022-03-25 09:03:51,1
tmq12c,"The medications can lower the viral risk however, you will always risk spreading it to someone but if you are in a shedding stage its still a possibility to spread it. 

Also always tell someone that you are sexually active with whether protected or unprotected that you are hsv positive and let them decide if they want to accept the risk or not.
 
Good luck.",2022-03-28 02:55:05,1
tm3n0q,I’ve only had one outbreak but the lymph nodes on both sides of groin got super swollen… before my hsv diagnosis I thought I had 2 hernias or something,2022-03-24 19:16:06,1
tm3n0q,Did you have an outbreak within that week,2022-03-24 21:40:13,1
tm3n0q,Ever get cyst like bumps around the groin that look like ingrowns?,2022-03-25 03:00:27,1
tm3n0q,"Yes, I had a headache for 3 days, small fever, and swollen lymph nodes… it was only after 3 days of these symptoms that I got an actual outbreak. Since then, everything is normal again except my lymph nodes",2022-03-25 02:53:08,1
tm3n0q,I don’t think so… is that common after herpes?,2022-03-25 21:23:29,1
tmmqct,"yep. i coddled my gifter for like 3 weeks while he refused to get tested. meanwhile, im in pain and not understanding why meds wont work. i had trich, herpes, a yeast infection, and a possible UTI.  


you dont need him and you know that so you'll be okay. his level of support now is indicative of his level of support in the future and during future hardships, so i would just move on. If you want, you can let him know that you are doing all the heavy lifting while suffering yourself. but ehh some people just dont get it.",2022-03-24 16:52:26,2
tmmqct,"I’m assuming he’s asymptomatic. He may not even realize the actual pain you are going through along with the mental side of it all.
If you are cool with moving on from him but do possibility see a future with him then it wouldn’t hurt to be openly honest with him as you’ve done with us. It would be a nothing to lose kinda thing.",2022-03-24 18:24:44,1
tmmqct,Beautiful ❤️,2022-03-24 17:00:16,1
tm07cp,Do you mean it triggered a genital outbreak? Lip fillers can rarely trigger oral herpes but not genital herpes.,2022-03-24 08:06:34,3
tm07cp,Yes it definitely triggered it. I didn’t even test positive for HSV-1. I never had issues until I received lip filler,2022-03-24 10:37:30,1
tm4dfu,I’m experiencing something similar. It’s been 4 weeks since I found out I have ghsv1 and all my symptoms have cleared but my lymph nodes on both sides of my groin are still a bit swollen and sore. Not sure how long it’ll take to go down and if this means I’m still viral shedding?,2022-03-24 19:21:13,1
tm4dfu,"Your body is actively creating antibodies for 3-6 months after your primary OB. So your lymph nodes being swollen or tender in this time frame is not that odd and it’s a sign that your body is doing exactly what it should be. 

This is also the point in time where you are more likely to have reoccurring OB. Support your body with rest, water and health foods. Xoxo",2022-03-25 03:08:37,1

tks6ng,"UPDATE - he responded well too. He said: 

“I will definitely go get checked and I feel terrible if I’ve given it to you. I’ll do some research but I have been asymptomatic, and I hope we can talk and work this out together. I’ll try to go and get my screen straight after work this afternoon, thank you for letting me know. Are you okay?”",2022-03-24 04:52:24,19
tks6ng,"I think this is a lovely message. It’s not accusatory and gives him space to look into it. One silver lining of HSV is it can show people’s true colours. He should be grateful for your openness, though of course might be upset himself, but should ultimately respond with kindness. Don’t beat yourself up if it doesn’t go this way - you’ve simply dodged a person who’s not right for you.",2022-03-23 12:01:49,57
tks6ng,That’s really really nice. Most people would be furious throwing around accusations being very aggressive and wanting to end things in a lot of cases! For you to be that nice and be concerned about him wanting to continue is super sweet. The world needs more people like you,2022-03-23 13:48:10,13
tks6ng,That’s such a good message!,2022-03-23 12:54:48,9
tks6ng,Just know it can lat dormant in your system for years.,2022-03-23 12:43:08,21

tks6ng,"Far nicer than the msg I sent which went

“Hey so you gave me herpes which is shitty, the blister on your crotch wasn’t just an I grown hair but a herpes blister. You need to get tested, medicated if your symptoms are rough and disclose to any future sexual partners so that they can make an informed decision about their health” I then blocked him because I did not want to entertain the whole “no it wasn’t me who gave it to you” I literally get tested before every partner and several months after a partner & previously had never tested positive for it. Also this relationship wasn’t a happy healthy one and I was angry at him. I think ur message is very well considered. 

Also off topic but this is wild, the std nurse told me I didn’t have to disclose because I asked if they had a disclosing service so it didn’t have to come from me. I decided that ethically, I should let them know because clearly they had sysmtoms before I did and were in denial about it, so I felt like I should make it clear to them. Wild tho that a health provider would say that",2022-03-23 15:53:42,4

Was definitely one of the scariest things I've done but it felt so much better after. Good luck!!!

Side note, unless you specifically ask to be tested for HSV the regular sti panel does NOT include any test for it. It's only included if you have symptoms generally",2022-03-23 18:39:04,3
tks6ng,"Just a question, not an accusation. Were you screened for HSV during your STI panel before sleeping with him? Herpes is often not checked for unless specifically asked about.

tks6ng,"If you slept with other people even protected it’s possible you got it from them also. The thing about HSV is, unlike HIV, chlamydia and gonorrhea you don’t need bodily fluids to get it just skin to skin contact. When you’re first diagnosed it’s the most troubling. However, you’ll soon realize that hsv is so common that most people have some strain of it. Your message is fine but you need to make sure that you didn’t already have it in your system. A blood test could of also been used on your previous std checkup. But if it directly after a sexual assault, it can take several months before it shows up on a test and that alone can be a reason why it could of showed clear even if you had contracted it back then. Did you do a subsequent std test after that assault before this test?",2022-03-23 23:03:08,1
tks6ng,"Honestly you came about to very mature and friendly, that’s amazing of you, my situation was different, the girl lied to me and told me right after we had sex that she has herpes lool, what caused you to get checked ?

tks6ng,"It’s a great message… somewhat similar to what I stated after my first outbreak and confirmed GHSV1 (confirmed by sore IgM (+), IgG (-) so primary outbreak. I told him it’s best to get tested. Mind you this was a friend i was having this discussion with… they may react in a way you will not expect: anger and frustration (while you should be the one more upset) remember to stay in a  positive mindset. You may not get the support you need from them and they might blame you. But yes this is very important to have because it can change their mindset of how to proceed with sex in the future.",2022-03-24 06:55:43,1

tks6ng,"So i’m going through the exact same thing; and my boyfriend hasn’t been screened in between me and his last partner or two before me. I approached it pretty much the same way as you; calm and collected about it and my message is almost identical. I was terrified to have the conversation since we had been seeing each other for about 2.5-3 months when this occured; and I knew it had to be him because any sex I had prior to meeting him was protected and one day I got hit like a truck with all the initial break out symptoms. My boyfriend took it well and it hasn’t ruined or affected the relationship, and I believe he passed it to me without knowing he ever had it since most people who have it are asymptomatic and “lucky” to never experience a break out. After telling him he even said I know who I must’ve gotten it from and it wasn’t you; so I know deep down he does believe he has it and knows some potential people who put him at risk for all this. It’s been like 3 weeks since I found out, and he’s still good about it, however mine did hit a denial stage. Since he’s asymptomatic, he doesn’t think he has it. He doesn’t want to really address the topic, even though I know he most definitely has it, and he wants to get tested and go through his own avenues of testing to confirm. I hope yours doesn’t hit a denial stage, just because it is frustrating when they deny the facts, logic, and proof of “hey, I’ve only been seeing you and having sex with you, you’re the only explanation of how I got this, it doesn’t come out of thin air.” I’m just baffled at that since it’s like boy I could’ve freaked out at you for giving me an STD but I didn’t at all! I’m at a standstill with it all until he goes and gets a full STI blood screening, we’ve had sex after I healed but since he is in the denial stage of not believing he could have it, he wants to use condoms NOW, even though it’s like boy you gave it to me lmao you can’t catch it when you have it. Good luck friend, if he goes and gets tested please report back on everything!",2022-03-26 19:37:22,1
tks6ng,"I sent similar to the person who gave it to me. He was nasty. And totally in denial. And also having unprotected sex with someone new already. Yes I know 100% he was the one that gave it to me. And the Drs I saw agreed. The time frame of my initial infection can only have been him. Plus he was the only 1 I had been sleeping with for 6 months before my diagnosis so he was exposed regardless. At one time he had a raw patch of skin like chafing on his penis. That can be all it shows as in men. Where as my initial 2 outbreaks were horrific.
I am on antivirals now which thankfully are suppressing it.
I hope you get a decent response from this fella.
A lot don't wanna know about it. Hence why it's so widespread! Good luck! x",2022-03-28 08:16:40,1

tks6ng,"This makes me so happy because this is how responsible and respectful adults should be able to have these conversations, and as long as that respect and willingness to learn and communicate is in place, you'll be able to figure things out. There's really just no need to add unpleasantness or drama to the situation, and I think your message to him did such a great job of inviting this kind of interaction. It doesn't mean there won't be emotional things for you to work through as you learn about herpes, but you've given yourself such a great start <3 Also really glad you posted this to give others guidance on navigating this situation that almost none of us were adequately prepared for!",2022-03-24 16:32:21,8

tks6ng,"This is true, but also, we have to exercise the degree of common sense. If somebody had no symptoms  for years, and then got symptoms  only after having an encounter with one person, it stands to reason that is where they caught the infection.

Calm yourself everything will work out the way it supposed to! Once again I was really impressed with you! I know you said you had mild symptoms,  can I ask what kind of test you were given?

tks6ng,"They don't test for HSV in the US unless you specifically ask for an HSV test and even then a doctor would be hesitant without any symptoms/open sores or reason to believe you were exposed.  This is because it's so common and low risk.  If they did test for it, you can look at your lab results and it should say HSV-1/HSV-2 somewhere.

Edit:. Here's a link from the CDC https://www.cdc.gov/std/herpes/screening.htm",2022-03-23 19:53:52,11

tks6ng,"Yeah that’s a symptom, sorry you’re going through this but you’re strong, yeah I was tested four weeks after and it was negative, I specifically asked for a hsv test. Doctors told me from my description and the fact she uses meds and I used a condom while no outbreak, I have no symptoms and the chances are very low but I’m still going to get another test in 6 weeks but it’s mentally draining",2022-03-23 23:38:48,1
tks6ng,"Yes, in that way I do think mildly hold some responsibility, so I admire you for taking that into consideration. A lot of people point the finger and don’t realize what they could get themselves into. I went full extreme and blamed myself and still deal with shame but I have more reasons than that that I battle with self esteem. It’s just one small piece.

However, I think if you come across overly nice, and self blaming he could flip the script. Whereas there could be an other way that still evokes good, healthy conversation. 

I pray the best outcome for you and I think your a sweetheart and I hope it’s respected. Whatever way you choose to say it.",2022-03-24 02:10:38,1
tks6ng,That sucks. Sorry this is happening. Seems like you have a good mentality about it though,2022-03-23 18:44:26,1
tks6ng,"That’s how it happened to me. I waited a long time to have sex after my ex fiancé, then boom one random hookup in January of this year, I got HSV 2. Had all the symptoms within 4 days. My blood tests were NEGATIVE meaning this a NEW infection - my swab test was positive for HSV 2 on an active sore. I responded immediately to the antiviral. So if your blood is negative, don’t let people get you down. People that are saying it’s too “ coincidental “ need to learn some compassion for this entire community. The person who gave it to me, had a very recent STI panel and they didn’t test him for HSV and then after I had gotten my results he got the blood test and boom he was positive for HSV 2 but he’s asymptomatic. I think your text is very well worded by the way. This is something I’m still getting used to for it happened for me in January and you’re not alone. 💗",2022-03-24 01:05:42,5
tks6ng,Exactly.  Sometimes things are just that obvious.   You’re handling this well and I commend you.,2022-03-24 00:39:14,7

tks6ng,I’m not sure that saying it’s “too coincdental” shows a lack of compassion.  I was alluding to that only to counter those who try and claim that you can’t blame the person you are sure gave it to you because many in these subs will try to say you’re the one who may have had it forever and not known; despite the fact that it just so happened to have occurred shortly after the first encounter in a long time.,2022-03-24 03:55:41,1

I have both types below the belt.  It’s only a big deal if you let them make it a big deal. Fyi-I always told them early on.   For me it became a way to filter out the jerks.  Growing up when-we still didn’t know much about how HIV/AiDs was contracted and who was at risk, made herpes seem inconvenient since it wasn’t deadly.  

Volunteering at elementary schools, I saw at least two kids in each classroom had sores on their lips.

It’s nothing to be ashamed about. You can even get HSV 2 from oral with someone that has a cold sore. 1/3 of the population has HSV. I’m saying this, because HSV isn’t a “dirty” disease. It’s so easy to spread by just mere skin contact. I’m not even going to classify it as a STI because it’s not a dirty disease. Of course we still need to disclose it to partners but we need to get rid of the stigma surrounding HSV. It’s not chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis or even HIV. (No shaming on any of them!

They will accept it because they want you for you as a person. They want A L L of you. They will not see you as any less than 100% just because you have hsv. you don’t want somebody that only wants part of you… nobody wants that.,2022-03-23 21:35:55,2
tla843,I hope you are able to get past this phase and accept your new self (I am still working on this - just confirm hsv on feb28). It’s okay to feel what you are feeling but do not allow yourself to feel like that forever. We have one life and you can still do everything you wanted to do previously. I’m extremely grateful that this is all I am dealing with. It could be soooooo much worse. This has showed me I need to 1. Educate myself on fucking LIFE and 2. Be kind to my body and treat it as a temple. We are expensiveeeeee - not everyone gets access and if I consider them worthy well you best believe we will be having the std conversation and exchanging results. The right person will do research and understand it’s not a huge deal. The right person will do everything to be with you.. just as you would do for that right person.,2022-03-23 22:11:16,2
tlwfdf,"True. If you tested less than 12 weeks after possibly exposure , test again with igg , or get tested with western blot. The low positive doesn’t mean it’s a false positive , but that it has a greater chance of being that.",2022-03-24 07:22:36,1
tlwfdf,If you tested positive on igg but negative on swab should you retest?,2022-03-24 15:17:28,1
tlwfdf,"Depends.  If you had an OB and had it swabbed late it could produce a false neg. So positive swabs accurate , negatives one you may have tested too late. 

Igg taken at same time as swab or very soon after that comes back positive already would likely mean it not a new infection. May have been a first OB but likely and infection that you  have had a while ( while unfortunately can mean weeks , months or even years ). 

So if your igg is a solid positive especially for hsv2 but you are swabbing negative then you could retest but probability is you are a true positive.  If a low positive and no OB or swabbed but unsure if was hsv then I would retest at 12 weeks post last exposure with Igg or get a western blot. 

Few people have mentioned even with a higher result , over 3.5 with.no known OB they have gotten a neg on WB.",2022-03-24 17:26:32,1

This is *such* a stretch.  You could have said one of your friends mentioned this without naming her. You've not only violated her confidentiality, but that of her partner's. 

Did you tell your partner about your mom's oral herpes before kissing him? Your mom is infectious even when she doesn't have outbreaks. If your parents are still married, there's a great chance your dad has it, too. Your grandparents, aunts, uncles - most of them probably have it. There's a good chance you do, and you don't even know. 

This is what bothers a lot of us that live with herpes. Others are very quick to judge and worry - and you did both - without having any idea of what their own status is.

In terms of Valtrex, I have heard claims that it’s not great to take long term but doctors prescribe it for daily usage and I take it daily. It really depends on your preference. Before my current relationship, I took it before/during an outbreak( I get them 4-5 times a year), but now I take it daily. My boyfriend asked me to so it would lower his risk of transmitting and because he sees that my outbreaks are painful and emotional for me, so he wants me to do it for myself as well. I’ve noticed that in my experience I really have to take it everyday (preferably at the same time) for it to be effective. If I skip a dose or two, I might break out. The only side effect I’ve really noticed is I tend to get a little dehydrated when taking it so I make sure to drink a lot of water. I also think that staying healthy in general has helped reduce my outbreaks- not drinking, no marijuana ( this triggered outbreaks for me), limit stress, etc. and more exercise, healthy eating, taking daily vitamins.

tljpqi,"Hey there! Totally understand your frustration! I’ll never forget when I asked my doc “so when will I not be in pain anymore?” He goes “well IF the swab determines it is herpes the medication should work very quickly” so if you responded well to the Valtrex - I’d go with the assumption you have HSV. I got my diagnosis in January my first OB - since then I get “episodes” where I’m fluish, or feel nerve pain in my thigh down to my foot and that’s how I know to double up on the Valtrex. So it’s hard to say you’ll ever have sores to be tested again. 

Best of luck and hope this helped! You’re never alone 💗",2022-03-24 01:23:52,2

tlepqs,"There's a lot of home remedies out there - lots of people on this sub use lemon balm, high quality raw (unprocessed) honey and other essential oils like tea tree to topically treat outbreaks and help them to heal faster, but it doesn't work for everyone. Similarly some people take daily supplements of l-lysine and red marine algae and swear by them to fend off outbreaks, but others find they are of little benefit. In a similar vein some people avoid certain foods, such as chocolate or nuts which contain arganine as these can be triggers for them. Others can eat whatever they like. Everyone is different.

The herpes handbook from westover heights lists a few supplements but points out that there are few rigorous, academic studies (often not peer reviewed) to back up the claims that these supplements are effective.

I suspect part of the issue is that these are natural treatments which cannot easily be patented and marketed by pharmaceutical companies, so there is not the funding/interest for more studies.

Looking at that study you linked, there's limited info on how the tests were actually conducted but it sounds like they were injecting herpes viruses/infected cells with essential oils - this is not the same as applying them topically to an already infected patient... so I'm not sure how valid it is to generalise this study to your average person with hsv1/2.

I think the best approach is to try some supplements out (provided it's done safely - ask your dr if unsure) and see what works best for you. At the moment the most effective treatment, with the most research backing it up, would be antiviral medications.",2022-03-23 22:01:43,4

There would also be the risk that people that’s been with me at some point will realize I either gave them herpes or that I have it, hearing it from someone else. Then they would be mad and I would be known as a person that just go around and give people herpes without caring. 
I heard that one of my co workers gave one of the others herpes. When she confronted him he said “so, I can’t do anything about it, live with it”. I don’t think she knew. I thought it was disgusting (I didn’t have it myself then). Not because of the herpes itself, but because he didn’t care.

I tested myself every 6 months. I had the STD conversation with everyone I played with. Which leads me to understand now most people lie or uneducated. Though, I have educated the person who gave me their HSV, he still doesn't see any reason to disclose to future partners.

There are so many posts here ""If I had only known"" ""I didnt know it wasn't tested for when I asked about their sti testing"".

If you know you have it, you have the opportunity to discuss this with your partner by opening the conversation. You may even be sat there thinking ""well they asked about an STI panel and I know hsv isn't on there so I'm technically not lying when I say my panel came back clean"". That to me is wrong and I would feel pretty shitty omitting hsv in that conversation.

It is not our fault or the fault of our partner that our society is not better educated about hsv. Once we get that knowledge, I believe it is a moral obligation to make sure we are on the same page and use the opportunity to educate. 

If a partner said to me ""I've only been tested for chlamydia"" and I slept with them, and I caught another sti, well that's on me for accepting.

tknh13,"Then you're still very much in the early days. There's lots of posts on westover heights clinic forum to support that it takes a few months for the body to get used to the virus, but after 1 year ghsv1 tends to be much less severe or frequent in terms of outbreaks and shedding. Don't worry",2022-03-24 16:53:16,1
tknh13,"Have you done research into it? Having hsv1 would mean that there is a huge chance that a lot of the women you sleep with already have hsv1 in their system (cold sores) and are at no risk of contracting it from you. Secondly, ghsv1 tends to have much milder outbreaks and less frequent than ghsv2. Transmission of ghsv1 to the genitals of a partner is also extremely unlikely- Terri Warren has never seen such a transmission in 35 years. The vast majority of ghsv1 is caused by someone with a cold sore performing oral sex. Shedding is also amongst the lowest, so risk of transmission is also lower. If you combine all that with antivirals and condom use, you really have no reason to avoid sex out of fear of transmitting to a partner.",2022-03-23 22:59:51,1

To be completely honest, I am leaning more towards the theory that the body is just having an immune inflammatory reaction to a new virus that is agitating the genital region. 

This is why it frustrates me so much when people in this sub tell people that it “can’t possibly be herpes“ if you’ve got weeks and weeks of itching or redness. 

Many people report this. Especially during primary outbreak months.  The assertion that you’re supposed to be 100% normal - get blisters for 7 to 10 days - and then back to 100% normal, just doesn’t match reality.",2022-03-23 23:30:17,1

tkuze3,"I like that you’re reaching out like this. There’s literally nothing worse than the several weeks after diagnosis. Where you’re completely fucking alone. 

Literally there’s nothing worse. You can’t go anywhere with your thoughts that gives you relief. And you can’t tell anyone.  I advise that you don’t, even if you think they’re safe to tell. 

Find people who have it and talk to them. So I hope somebody does call you. In fact I hope several people reach out to you and offer to call. Because talking to people is the only thing that helps. Other people that know what it’s like. 

I had one friend who I knew got it several years ago and I called her. She was my angel even though she hates discussing the topic, and wants to never think about it again because she doesn’t really get outbreaks anymore. 

Keep trying to find people to talk to you on the phone. It will help.",2022-03-23 20:39:00,3

tkvkpu,"skin itches as it heals unfortunately, due to skin cell turnover and histamine release. i also agree with the comment earlier regarding post-herpetic neuralgia (zapping, the crawlies, tingling/tickling, or any other nerve related sensation). the damaged and/or affected nerves as a result of the infection will take several months to regenerate and heal. until then, have you tried over the counter claritin or zyrtec for the itching? i also found A&D cream and Desitin ointment to be helpful for the skin as well.",2022-03-24 03:07:04,1
tkvkpu,Thanks so much for sharing. That has crossed my mind that it could be nerve damage but I don’t experience any pain just sporadic itchiness. Mainly after a bowel movement. I hope this goes away on its own,2022-03-23 19:12:44,1
tkkd9l,"Yeah seriously. People on here talk like HSV2 is a death sentence. If it’s on your genitals why is it such a big deal whether it’s type 1 or 2? In fact, I’d rather have type 2 because it’s less likely to be transmitted orally.",2022-03-23 03:02:25,4

I have type 2 which is supposed to be “worse,” more frequent, more severe, etc. But I’ve only ever had my first OB that lasted about a week and nothing since.

I don’t think she knew honestly, I don’t know her but based on her response it seems like a shock to her too. I think you’re not overreacting, any reaction is valid, but I think you overall need to do research and breathe. Doctors don’t even tell people what cold sores are. She told you what she knew. Talk to her, calmly and like an adult. Also chill out with saying people are just “willingly spreading it” especially here. We do nothing but try to build a understanding community. We want to help.

Now, I forget I have it. Most people with oral herpes get very few outbreaks. Nobody I’ve dated has ever cared and I am in a very happy relationship. From the sounds of it, you and your gf weren’t educated enough on cold sores. This sucks, but I don’t know that your girlfriend meant any harm. Just always remember to stay educated about stuff.",2022-03-23 17:29:04,3
tl0iuo,"When I was diagnosed with oral herpes, my doctor told me most people do have it. They may not have sores often or even ever. I was told it was a strain of the same virus that causes chicken pox. I was also told I wasn’t contagious unless had an open sore. That isn’t true. Since I hadn’t been kissing anyone for months, I didn’t know how I got it. I was the girl teased for being a prude. I felt my life was over. I’d never date, marry…. All not true.

tl0iuo,"Honestly she told you, she could have disclosed better and maybe that will be a lesson for her, to be more educated and cautious about spreading to people in the future. You mentioned you abstained from kissing her for a week but still contracted, so you knew it was contagious but after you learned the correct medical term you are really throwing it out of proportion. In all honesty, you kind of seem like you resent her a lot for it, I understand your frustration, and spiraling is totally normal  but if that's the case, then you should move on and let her find someone else who is less condensending. I don't think you'll move on happily with this person if you resent them so much and are angry at them.

tl0iuo,"To be honest, I understand her. I contracted GHSV1 recently and that's how I came to look up this page. Before that I had always assumed it had oral hsv1 cause I vaguely recall having what I thought was a cold sore when I was a child, but I guess wasn't one. 

I never thought about it. It's been so long and herpes just slipped my mind completely. Even if I had remembered, I think I wouldn't have thought much of it cause it's more common to have oral herpes than isn't.

If I had been diagnosed with OHSV1 I don't think I would have ended up here. I think I would have thought oh yeah that thing everyone has, and moved on.

Since getting ghsv1, I've told some people I know, and a lot have been like oh that's not a big deal though, I have Ohsv1 and legit never think about it. It's just incredibly normal.

I'm sorry that you're dealing with it and that you are upset she didn't tell you. I'm sorry that you're finding this difficult. I don't think she failed to tell you out of a desire to be dishonest or hide something she thought you should know.",2022-03-23 17:37:49,0

Those who have one type in multiple areas usually will have contracted them at the same time.",2022-03-23 18:04:16,2
tl0iuo,"It is in fact more common to have it than not, people just don't get tested for it so they don't know. You seem really hostile about this, and while I understand it's annoying it could end up not being a big deal in your life. Outbreaks can be a pain but you might have to deal with few if any at all.

I am overreacting? so are you just another girl spreading herpes?",2022-03-23 18:02:02,-6
tl0iuo,This is wrong . Regardless of how we feel about HSV people still have the right to chose what they want for their health. Herpes affects everyone differently so just because it’s not a “big deal “ in your life doesn’t mean it can’t take a toll on someone else’s . Just because she had 1 outbreak her whole life doesn’t me he’s gonna get only one. It was very manipulative of her to wait 5months into the relationship before disclosing and ontop of that to misinform her partner and say “it’s no big deal” when having an active outbreak…. Not fair . I’mHSV+ to btw,2022-03-24 10:50:50,1

tl0iuo,Kmsl wow . Again calm down .Yes you are overreacting definitely. Cold sores are nothing to worry about . What do you want from us? To be upset and cry with you because you have herpes ? Newsflash WE ALL HAVE IT and it’s not a big deal.  Now if you feel betrayed and heartbroken okay i understand . But no I’m not going to tell you herpes is the worst because it’s not . And also no i dont go around spreading herpes i tell my partner and it’s not a big deal .,2022-03-23 18:06:49,10

tl0iuo,Him being upset over her lying is fine . But herpes is not a big deal . Why would i tell him . Your life is over ! This pain will be unbearable? You should do this or that ?! No ..I’m not . He does need to calm down . I never got the whole” let’s make them feel worse and make them scared” thing . I gave him advice on taking meds and to calm down . It’s not a lot to say right now but frankly the best thing he needs to do is to get on meds and not freak out .,2022-03-24 19:20:54,1

tl0iuo,None of us woke up and said “ yes id like a side of herpes with a extra side of outbreak “ . But we have it and it’s here permanently. Anything technically can be a big deal but my advice is to not let this ruin you . Take your medicine. Valtrex on Rx is 15 bucks . Once you take your medicine your outbreak will stop . After you do that i would suggest counseling. But you need to calm down . Being upset and hurt won’t solve anything . Doing something for your outbreak and pain will .,2022-03-25 01:39:01,1

tk4hpb,Yeah sucks to get it on ur first experience. But after having it so long it’s like not having it anymore. Doesn’t affect me anymore. Rarely an OB. I don’t take medication for it nor will I ever. Body builds up antibodies over time and suppressed it. Also it’s very common to have. All in all there’s much worse things to catch.,2022-03-23 11:28:03,1
tk4hpb,I was gonna wait to join the discord you post about until I am ACTUALLY diagnosed via blood work at the start of April. Just got visually diagnosed by an ER doctor and my general practitioner and I saw the discord post asking for only those who are 100% diagnosed. So you will probably see me in there around the start of April once I get my tests back. :) Thank you!,2022-03-22 17:54:44,3

tksc14,"What what you have described pretty much zero chance of hsv, but sever ocd anxiety. 

Transmission if she is shedding (which you don’t know) or OB which is not apparent from your post is skin to skin. Ie her skin where the infection is present , you said genitals to your skin. Her genitals need to make contact with your genitals or oral area or if it’s your hands likely where you have some open cut / abrasion. Not her back that you rubbed. Even if she had some viral load on her hands it’s a fragile viral that doesn’t live long off of infected area. And she would have to have a sufficient viral load to spread from an area where she is not infected.

Ghsv can easily be 1 or 2.  Ghsv1 has become more common due to ohsv1 positive people performing oral sex on hsv1 negative people.",2022-03-23 12:22:28,3
tksc14,"I completely understand your concerns because for the longest time, my OCD was absolutely debilitating and I was constantly stressed about catching anything that anyone else has. However, it is important to note that unless you had sex with, kissed, or shared drinks or food while she was having an OB, you’re very unlikely to contract herpes. I understand how stressful your situation may be to you right now, but take a deep breath and remind yourself how herpes is transmitted. You’ll be completely fine :). But if you start getting a rash that you think could be herpes, go see your provider and they can give you professional help. From my standpoint though, you are just very stressed out and you should be absolutely fine :).",2022-03-23 12:24:39,2
tksc14,No risk. Stop worrying.,2022-03-23 13:15:28,2
tksc14,"If you check out expert Terri Warrens herpes handbook , she will reiterate the skin to skin transmission.  So things like sharing food , drinks and almost all inanimate objects or indirect contact ie she touches something then touches you are just not the way you will get hsv. Only item of concern lipstick / chapstick. 

And a person isn’t contagious 24/7. Only during OB and viral shedding & you need a minimum viral load to get infected. 

Sore throats and coughs are rampant right now , omicron still making the rounds",2022-03-23 15:50:33,2
tksc14,"Hi!

Thank you for your reply. I definitely did not have any contact with her genitals, but I think that because she is on daily antivirals and ‘hasn’t had any issues since the first time’ (her words) that she might not be as careful. For example, I saw her removing her tampon because she had the door open and then she closed it with her bare hands.

I do have OCD, and I do have anxiety. And I’m trying to balance that without being disrespectful or offensive, so thank you.

I’m also worried about the sore throat and cough because of posts/anecdotes like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/gbzo4e/so_im_really_worried_about_my_throat/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) (referring to the comments).",2022-03-23 14:18:55,1
tksc14,"Hi!

Thank you for understanding. I do have anxiety/OCD and the last thing I want is to come off offensive or disrespectful. We did share food (she used her fork to taste my food a few times here and there) but her outbreak was genital and not oral, but I can’t be sure that I didn’t catch anything from her that way.

I’m also worried about the sore throat/coughing systems because of anecdotes (the comments) like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/gbzo4e/so_im_really_worried_about_my_throat/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf).

tksc14,"Of course! It’s completely reasonable to be stressed about it, especially after sharing food. But if she did not have an active outbreak in her mouth I am almost 100% positive that you’ll be completely fine. Take a deep breath and monitor yourself for any symptoms like sores in your mouth mainly. It’s highly unlikely that you caught it so I think the best thing for you right now would be to reach out to any therapist/counselor/support system you have and just take some self care time to help yourself calm down a bit. I know things like this can be scary but you’re most likely completely fine. I hope you feel better soon and let me know if you need to talk about anything related to this!

If you check out the ""Herpes Research Cure"" subreddit, you'll see that there are currently many big companies in the process of creating a therapeutic vaccine.

By encouraging people to donate to these companies, we will get a cure faster. By pretending that herpes is just a ""skin rash"", we're essentially saying, we're okay without a cure.

tk8bhb,"Girl I love how freaking blunt you are on tiktok! Being nearly 34 and new to this it does help a lot. A little rant here but stick with me,

The stigma is so real and people really don't understand what hsv really is. I find a lot of frustration with our medical community, in the last 2 weeks I can't tell you the countless times I've been told its not a big deal everyone has it by the drs and some others. I said I was pissed with the fact that I always asked to be screened for everything but yet was never informed hsv was not part of that because they don't recommend it because of the false positive rate and creates undue emotional stress and because so many people have it asymptomatically and eill never have an outbreak the diagnosis would be too emotionally stressful.. so the small percent that are symptomatic carry the burden of the stigma and the burden to educate and be decent humans... 

If there are ways to double check the the positive results and give someone, though asymptomatic, the education on the virus, that they claim is no big deal, it's so common, WHY ARENT WE. why on tiktok [I don't really use YouTube so I can't say] is it just people like you and other creators affected by hsv advocating and the medical community creators staying quiet? I have searched for one medical community creator to address this topic, in particular gential herpes, a couple of drs stitch a video about oral herpes, to help educate the rest and I don't see it.. does it exist, if they do, can you share with me. 



I feel so failed by the doctors and it's not right.  But the community that exists around this is so incredibly supportive!",2022-03-26 12:22:29,1

I have a relative who's been waiting on a cure (and donating tons of personal finances) for over a decade, and hasn't reached a good place with their status at all. I might talk about it at some point but I'm also not as versed in the science/tech, and think there are more science-minded advocates out there who could probably do more. Again though, because it could take years, \*and\* does rest on the notion that herpes is really serious and debilitating, I don't want to overfocus on that. While I 100% think they need to develop a treatment and am totally behind it, I'm not going to paint a picture of herpes the stigma already has, you know? Just my personal stance.

I got my diagnosis after I got back in the dating game from my divorce. So I was a divorced, single mom to a small child with behavior issues and now THIS!?! I hit rock bottom, hard! I pushed everyone away, I rejected all date invitations because it's easier to play hard to get than having to be really vulnerable with someone again.  After a while, I started to focus on learning to love myself again and discovering who I was and what made me happy. I realized I am MORE than my diagnosis and deserving of love. I'm also a Christian so I relied on my faith a lot during this time. I know that God has a plan for me and nothing, NOTHING will derail that. Fast forward two years and I am in the healthiest relationship of my life! I spent time getting to know my partner before we got physical, we fell in love with each others personality before our bodies ever touched. He knew about my relationship issues in the past and I was honest with him about how I contracted the disease (I was given it on purpose out of revenge) and he was understanding. He asked questions and did his own research and because we had taken the time to get to know each other first, he knew who I REALLY was and didn't see me as just a disease. He saw how common it was and knew I was the person he wanted to be with, so he made the conscious decision on his own to be ""all in"".

I would imagine that between the stress of the pandemic, getting COVID and/or getting a vaccine (which let's be honest, the possible majority of adults haven't had any sort of vaccine since they were kids), a lot of people's immune function decreased enough for their HSV that had been camping out quietly in their nerve endings to finally have an opportunity to show up.

tkh8jl,"Yeah dude, definitely don't worry. But take the opportunity to educate yourself while it's on your mind -- HSV-2 is way more common than you might think and a very low proportion of people who have it actually know that they have it. You're way more likely to contract it from someone else who doesn't know their status than from her.

Same with HSV-1, which is extremely common orally and can transmit to genitals (causing GHSV-1) -- not common outside of an outbreak, but also happens all the time. Most sexually active individuals are immune to GHSV-1, though, because they already have HSV-1. I got unlucky there myself, though!

I think most people who are sexually active understand those risks on some level, but don't understand how likely it really is to contract during your lifetime because no one talks about it (partly because most don't know if they've already gotten it). If it's something you're very worried about, you can take steps to reduce or accept the risk (like seeing if you/your partners are already positive for either strain, then deciding if you want to use protection/antivirals, etc.). Transmission is always unlikely outside of an outbreak, but that does tend to be how it happens, when it does.",2022-03-23 17:39:12,1

tjrr9n,"I think what’s interesting about your thoughts regarding herpes is that society generally agrees with this notion. Hear me out for a sec.. 
let’s think about what it truly takes to avoid getting herpes (any type). 

You have to be lucky enough to be born to loving parents who don’t have herpes themselves. As you grow up you have to be lucky enough no one you interact with physically in your family/friends circle has herpes. If this works out, you get to your teen years without herpes exposure. 

Now you’re starting to get interested in sex so you are looking to date. You were fortunate that your parents or family circle have educated you so you know to request a full panel STD test at the start of talking to a romantic interest and do a follow up 12-16 weeks after to give you a high probability your romantic interest doesn’t have any STDs. During the 12-16 week wait between tests, you avoid any physical contact or kissing and you keep tabs on your romantic interest to ensure they haven’t been involved with anyone else physically or intimately. 

Once you verified they are “safe”, you feel confident and the relationship expands to include physical intimacy. You possibly use condoms for birth control but enjoy an STD free sex life. 

But in order to remain STD free, you keep tabs on your romantic interest in the hopes there is no cheating or physical contact (herpes gladiatorum/herpetic whitlow anyone?) with others during the relationship. 

As with any relationship, it may or may not work out long term. If it works out.. great you marry your high school or college sweetheart (depending on when you decide to get into a sexual relationship) and stay together forever only having sex and physical contact with each other. If not.. you remain diligent and you repeat the testing criteria and precautions you implemented earlier as well as the “continuous tracking” of romantic interests in order to avoid herpes as well as other STDs. 

Does this sound like anything that occurs in modern dating? 

Exactly, it’s so mechanical, no spontaneity, no trust, persistent paranoia and possible anxiety. 

Sure there are reasonable precautions you can take to avoid STDs in general but herpes is a tougher one to avoid. Given all the ways it can transmit besides intimate contact, how free-spirited and spontaneous modern dating is, condoms not being as effective against the skin to skin  nature of spread vs. the fluid based STIs, many ppl not getting tested and herpes ability to transmit asymptotically.  

Society needs to just accept herpes is a reasonable risk in finding love, sex, relationships and stop vilifying it. Without that change, then ppl are inadvertently agreeing with your stance of “it’s better not knowing” based on the current stigma.",2022-03-22 09:33:19,10
tjrr9n,"The thing is we don't deliberate this way over oral herpes, but as soon as it's genital it's a different story — the double standard is frustrating. No one's testing themselves to see if they carry HSV1 or 2 in reference to oral flareups (""coldsores"") and rarely disclose if they do. Yet we have this dark, depressing cloud over it being genital or anywhere else.

tjrr9n,"""I think we should all consider why the CDC recommends not testing if you don’t have very visible symptoms.""

They don't say that surely? They don't say ""very"" visible, they say if you don't have ANY symptoms. It's the same here in the UK.

But if you DO have symptoms then the advice is go and get tested, not bury your head in the sand.

There is a massive difference between advising against asymptomatic testing and advising against testing fullstop.

What if you don't have hsv? What if you have syphilis or gonorrhoea or chancroid or any number of other far worse, dangerous infections that can and will do irreversible damage if left untreated. Are you going to avoid going to a clinic because you don't want to be swabbed specifically for hsv? If your previous partners were not aware of their hsv status, what makes you so sure they are aware of any of their other STI statuses?

Symptoms should never, ever be ignored. Burying your head in the sand and saying you don't wish to know does not change the fact that you may have something going on down there and if you are positive nothing will change that fact.

There are plenty of people in this community who are not into the pity party, who are not living celebate lives. There are large number of people here who dont actually find disclosure an issue and people who have a very upbeat and realistic outlook on their future.

Regardless, anyone experiencing unusual changes on their genitals should 100% be going and seeing a doctor. There are things far worse than hsv out there.",2022-03-22 23:33:10,1

tjrr9n,"In fairness I think the reason is because of the location of the sore and what else they could possibly be caused by.

Most people know what a cold sore looks like - the majority are fairly typical in appearance and especially if someone has had them since childhood they likely have a parent or elder telling them at some point what exactly that thing is on their face, that they cannot hide, and how to deal with it.

But genital sores are a bit different - because there are many diseases and infections that can cause sores and genital hsv does not necessarily resemble cold sores. So yes, it could be hsv and you might be confident enough to say ""yeah that's probably herpes, meh"", but you could also very wrong - it could be syphilis or gonorrhoea or hpv or chancroid or balanitis or auto imminue disease and so on and so forth, and there's the risk of something quite serious. Equally if you get diagnosed with hsv and your partner has not disclosed, what else have they not told you about? What if you are now positive for an easily treatable bacterial chlamydia infection which you now will not deal with.

tjrr9n,"Forgive me if I come across as rude or too direct, but it reads like you're clutching at straws a bit here - I am not suggesting that a person with back pain or headaches needs to get tested for hsv and neither is the CDC/NHS.

It's the classic, physical symptoms of hsv that call for testing. Pure back pain or a headache is unlikely a cause for concern in terms of hsv; yes, these may well present themselves during the flu like stages of infection but often they will be accompanied by other more physical and alarming changes. Of course a person can be forgiven for not getting their genitals swabbed if they develop only a headache (although if they've recently had sexual contact with someone/regularly have sex, a regular sexual health check should be carried out ideally before/after a new partner). But the advice is clear - if you have symptoms of hsv, go and get tested. E.g. itching, blisters, sores, noticeable skin changes, painful urination and so on. Diagnosis should be by a professional, not by looking up symptoms on Google and going ""oh yeah I probably have herpes"", because as I say there could be any number of possible causes and these should be investigated and ruled out.

I don't know what your symptoms are but your original post reads along the lines of ""I have symptoms which match herpes, but I don't want to get tested because I don't want to know"". All I am saying is I think that that is a poor choice for you to make (but it's your choice and your body). You are assuming you may have herpes, but realistically there could be many other explanations and I presume you are not medically qualified to make that diagnosis. You also appear to start your post with advice from CDC that doesn't exist, in an effort to back up your viewpoint and I'm just pointing out that medical bodies never encourage people to just ignore symptoms.

You have authority and autonomy of your body and how you choose to use it. If hsv is indeed not a big deal for you, then better to get tested (if you are experiencing obvious symptoms) to find out if you have it/what else is causing the symptoms and then go from there. Worst case scenario you get complete clarity that you do in fact have hsv, with no more doubt about any other nasties, and you can go back to living your life continuing to believe that hsv is not a big a deal and not worth disclosing. I mentioned the other STIs because your post made it sound like you have not been tested for other infections since you developed symptoms, apologies if I misread.",2022-03-23 00:55:20,1

Maybe there are some triggers that you aren’t aware of when it comes to your own body. And it’s definitely a perspective thing, but most of the research I’ve read points to people commonly having a few outbreaks a year, if that, that generally taper off with time. Again, maybe that’s not the case, just what I’ve read. In my own case, when I was suffering from illness I had frequent outbreaks, but after changing some health behaviors I was able to go back to mild/infrequent outbreaks.

tk8i8e,"The tested for both, because hsv2 is “not isolated” you do not have hsv2",2022-04-07 14:02:55,1
tkfz06,Very rare,2022-03-23 00:04:49,7
tkfz06,"There is whitlow which occurs on the fingers, that might be a possibility. Hsv prefers groin and oral and doesn’t live outside that too long but it’s possible to say be breakout or shedding and transfer from somewhere moist to your junk.",2022-03-22 23:53:45,4
tkfz06,Very rare thought to be nearly impossible,2022-03-22 23:25:40,4
tkfz06,"I caught it after having protected sex. He took off the condom, we cuddled naked, my first outbreak was on my thigh. Probably rare. But yeah. Happens.",2022-03-22 23:22:46,2
tkfz06,"What are your symptoms?

If you haven't been swabbed yet, go and get swabbed ASAP. It may not even be herpes. But its important to swab as it can tell you exactly what type it is whereas a blood test cannot. You may already have hsv1 orally and be asymptomatic, in which case a blood test could come back positive leading you to believe you have it genitally because of your symptoms when in reality you have no genital hsv infection.

The likelihood is, IF it is herpes you have genitally, that you got it via oral sex and not from her hand.",2022-03-23 01:06:20,1
tkfz06,This is how I got it. Though it was infected male to me (female).,2022-03-23 14:33:39,1
tkfz06,I see. So it’s some what possible for genital hsv to be transferred from the finger to a penis within a short window of time ?,2022-03-22 23:56:16,1
tkfz06,"Thank you. 
 
Let’s say someone got a blowjob. But what is suspected to be a sore isn’t on the area where the girls mouth touched.  But her hand did. 

Is it possible for sores to show up elsewhere even if it’s from an oral hsv",2022-03-22 23:47:28,1
tkfz06,Interested to know where you get your ob’s now,2022-03-22 23:26:15,3
tkfz06,"Got ya. 

I did get tested three times. This last time was 9 weeks after unprotected sex. And 5 weeks since a protected encounter but unprotected oral. 

The symptoms were honestly all over.  I also just got off amoxicillin so I wasn’t sure if it was part fungal infection. Just felt itching in different places. Minor burning at different points. And a very small red areas on the shaft with what looked like the tiniest bump in the middle. These popped up in different locations over the past 3 weeks. And go away within like 2 or 3 days. 

Also had a head ache a few separate days and slight bit of leg restlessness.",2022-03-23 01:15:37,1
tkfz06,He touched him self. Then touched you?,2022-03-23 15:13:33,1
tkfz06,I believe I’ve read the same thing not too long ago. Or similar. Somewhat possible yes. I assume you got tested?,2022-03-22 23:58:12,1
tkfz06,"Sorry I’m not sure what you’re asking can you explain more?
Who is the one with Hsv and where is it? What were the sex acts performed?",2022-03-22 23:52:54,1
tkfz06,"Haha ugh. Thigh, labia, in my vagina, on my anus, inside and just below my nose, lower lip (that's from hsv I caught when I was 11, though,) and on my forearm.",2022-03-23 01:25:00,2
tkfz06,When you say you got tested was this blood tests or swabs? Have you had the bumps swabbed?,2022-03-23 01:20:56,1
tkfz06,Yes.,2022-03-23 19:55:55,1
tkfz06,I did. 5 weeks after. It was negative. But now am waiting for longer period,2022-03-23 00:01:07,1
tkfz06,"So I got a blow Job. The girl was taking a shower before hand and had her period. For all I know she could have been touching a sore with her hand. 

5-10 minutes later she gives a blow job. There is a spot where I suspect could be a very tiny sore. But her mouth did not reach this point. But her hand was touching it.  

What I’m also asking is. Can an hsv 1 transmission from the mouth cause sores to pop up in an area that the mouth did not touch",2022-03-22 23:55:26,1
tkfz06,Wow,2022-03-23 02:37:25,1
tkfz06,"Blood tests. 

They never swabbed the bumps. One doctor looked at it and said it looked like herpes. But he was also railing on me about being safe with condoms for oral. So I can tell if he was jumping to conclusions. To scare me. 

But at the same time I’ve looked at so many other possible things. And nothing else really can explain what it would be.  It’s on the shaft. It’s a small red irritated area. And a small bump in the middle. No hair involved. 

I made a post of it",2022-03-23 01:33:09,1
tkfz06,Do you know if she’s ever had a cold sore,2022-03-23 00:05:19,1
tkfz06,"So if she has ohsv1 & gave you a bj , if you became infected with hsv , the OB can be anywhere in the genital area.  Anywhere in the boxer short area.  Likely it was transferred from her mouth , not her hand.",2022-03-23 08:01:44,2
tkfz06,Yes but typically your first outbreak will be very close to the area of initial exposure. But hsv 1 on the genitals is not as bad as genital herpes type 2. With hsv1 down there recurrent outbreaks aren’t as common,2022-03-23 00:03:01,1
tkfz06,After reading this though 5-10 mins is along time. I assumed it was right before or during bj,2022-03-23 00:03:25,1
tkfz06,"To be fair, I consider myself a special case. The medications make it worse - THAT is just weird. I simply have unusual medical reactions with so much stuff.

I mean, I also picked my nose without washing my freaking hands lmfao

At least Abreva works!!! Very grateful for that.",2022-03-23 02:55:48,2
tkfz06,Really the absolute best bet is to get a swab,2022-03-23 01:47:05,1
tkfz06,"Yes she did say she’s had cold sores before. But not at that time.  

I’m just confused why the sore may show up further down in an area her mouth didn’t touch",2022-03-23 00:06:02,1
tkfz06,Yes I’ve heard that. I’m just trying to foresee if I may have gotten hsv 1 or 2.,2022-03-23 00:04:05,1
tkfz06,I honestly don’t know if she did or not. I can only assume she was touching her self to get a tampon out or something. Probably like 2 or 3 minutes at least,2022-03-23 00:05:09,1
tkfz06,How long does it take for the abreva to work if you don’t mind me asking?,2022-03-23 04:24:20,1
tkfz06,Antiviral made my nerve pain worse but kept lesions away so I kinda know what you mean,2022-03-23 07:24:31,1
tkfz06,I will if I ever get another bump,2022-03-23 01:48:35,2
tkfz06,"Did this girl tell you she had ghsv? Or does she have a history of ohsv? Cos it sounds like to me you got it through oral sex, the cause of 50% of new ghsv cases.

Or you could have gotten herpes months/years ago and are just happening to get your first outbreak now which coincided with a recent hook up.

Your hypothetical of this girl touching herself and giving it to you with her hands isn’t very logical. Especially if she was touching herself in the shower where water would wash off her hands. But it doesn’t even sound like she had an active outbreak?",2022-03-23 00:38:50,2
tkfz06,"Because it does not have to be at the EXACT location of contact. If it did transfer to you in the genital region it can show up anywhere in the “boxer brief” area. 
Example…. Exact point of contact was left thigh - it could show up on your butt cheek",2022-03-23 00:16:43,1
tkfz06,Depends on how quick I get it on,2022-03-23 08:07:06,2
tkfz06,"Yes she said she gets cold sores orally. 

She said she’s clean elsewhere but isn’t even sure if hsv is included on her tests.

Definitely not possible for that second bit though. I got tested three times around this period. And they have all been negative. But have had symptoms. 

I hadn’t slept with anyone for a while before her too 

Can’t know for sure If she had an outbreak. 

Afterwards she said she had a tear on her labia. But is it possible a condom and water makes that easier to happen?",2022-03-23 00:43:14,1
tkfz06,Got ya. That’s good to know thank you.,2022-03-23 00:22:25,1
tkfz06,"If you have herpes, you got genital herpes through oral sex. 

If your sore wasn’t swabbed and your tests came back negative then there is a possibility it was something else.

She did not give you herpes by touching herself and then touching you.",2022-03-23 00:54:53,3
tkfz06,"If she gets cold sores orally, she can def transmit it to you genitally if she performed oral sex on you.",2022-03-23 00:48:12,1
tkfz06,That’s good to know 🙏,2022-03-23 00:57:16,1
tkfz06,"Exactly, thank you for saying this!",2022-03-23 01:11:01,1
tkfz06,I know and I’m hoping that is what happened here. Vs genital transmission.,2022-03-23 00:56:41,1
tkfz06,Why you hoping that's the case? 🤔 Either way you'd get genital herpes. Doesn't matter how you got it. If she passed on oral herpes to your genitals chances are she probably did to you orally TOO in that case if you made out when she was shedding potentially.,2022-03-23 01:54:21,2
tkfz06,"True. I’m hoping that because hsv 1 sheds less than hsv2. 

Overall I’m hoping I have nothing",2022-03-23 01:56:37,0
tkfz06,"What symptoms have you had? Only genital symptoms? You had both hsv1 and hsv2 come back negative?? Also it is possible to have hsv2 orally so that's also a chance. More rare occurance orally but happens. 

Also yes it sheds less on average but my ex had like 3 outbreaks in like 7 years of having this and I've had over that in 3 month. Both type 2 soooo you just gotta hope you're lucky I guess",2022-03-23 01:59:06,1
tkfz06,"It seems like women have them more in general. I could be wrong though. 

My symptoms were just tiny red irritated areas with a minuscule bump that would go away in a couple of days. 

 Subtle burning or irritated. And itchiness in different locations. But I also suspected a fungal infection since I just came off amoxicillin. 

Also very minor head aches on and off and restless leg feeling. Or subtle aches. 

Hard to say how much of this is due to the intense stress my body went through with anxiety.",2022-03-23 02:16:18,1
tkfz06,I totally agree about how it's hard to say exactly. See if you get any actual sores. And yes women are a lot more likely to get it. This is thanks to nature nothing we've done :),2022-03-23 02:18:33,2
tjxd17,Feel free to DM me anytime. I’m 21F with GHSV1. I can send you some resources or just talk if you ever need/want to.,2022-03-22 13:44:44,6
tjxd17,"Hey don’t worry, you’re young so your immune system is most likely incredibly fit. HSV1 is usually not very severe genitally and when people acquire it at your age normally never get a recurrence",2022-03-22 08:03:51,4
tjxd17,"Aw hun don’t worry your life isn’t over! There are millions of us out here who are in the same boat. I’ve had the virus for about 8 years and I am happy married, and my husband has not contracted it. You will learn the sign and your body and figure out the best Rhythm for you. I know it’s hard and depressing at first but I promise there is a light at the end of the tunnel. I have GHSV1 as well. Since I’ve been married my OBS have been VERY scarce. Like I will only get an OB if I am stressed to the max. I use to get an outbreak pretty frequently before I met hubs. I’ve been with hubs for 5 years and this is the first OB I have had in almost 2 years. It gets better I promise! And you will find someone who loves you for ALL of you!",2022-03-22 13:58:15,4

tk7b3l,From what I’ve heard after 4 months of being infected your anti body’s are formed and your chances of spreading it to a new part of your body are crazy low. But if you have active cold sores don’t be touching them and then touching other places,2022-03-22 17:38:47,3
tk7b3l,"Thanks! I was hearing four months too but I can’t remember where I saw it, so I started doubting myself!",2022-03-22 18:39:06,2

tjsdqd,"My girlfriend has HSV-2 and I(32M) love her more than anything, your diagnosis doesn't define you. It was tough and frightening when she disclosed her status to me, but after I educated myself and got past the stigma that is herpes, it really doesn't create many obstacles for us. All it takes is finding the right partner.",2022-03-22 05:46:02,7
tjsdqd,Your life isn’t over,2022-03-22 02:29:23,3
tjsdqd,[deleted],2022-03-22 06:30:24,5
tjsdqd,"It's early. It's going to take time to cope. I was diagnosed at 22.  Life goes on. It gets better. It just feels like crap right now. 

For me, I've started to view it as a way to filter out people. If you dont think I'm worth the risk of a skin rash, maybe we're not meant to be. 

I've been in two very long term relationships since I was diagnosed and they did not have it and never got it from me. I just started dating a new person, and while disclosure is uncomfortable, we are having a good, healthy, and rewarding relationship now.",2022-03-22 02:54:46,2
tjsdqd,"It will be hard, but it will be manageable. Many people forget they have it. Things become much less frequent/severe. Take antivirals. Keep your immunity strong. You will have uncomfortable conversations and maybe some rejections, but it is part of the territory. It sucks and it’s not fair, but it’s your reality now (as is mine). Your mentality effects this greatly. Don’t roll over and die, persevere.",2022-03-22 03:20:34,2
tjsdqd,"Lol grow some balls man. ""My life is over"" lool okay bro.

Ive had it since 23 and im 26 now. Ive had a normal sex life before and still do now. They have medication that controls the symptoms which is the only shitty part about it. Its literally just a small portion of skin.

tjsdqd,I’m 24 and newly diagnosed as well. It’s been almost 4 months and I can honestly say I feel much better than I did that first month. Get a support system and try to focus your attention elsewhere. You’ll have your moments and that’s to be expected. Just try not to dwell. Take some time to mourn and grieve but know it’s not the end of the world and things could always be worse. Take it one day at a time,2022-03-22 12:27:46,1
tjsdqd,"I’ve had herpes for almost two years and my life feels pretty much back to what it felt like before I was diagnosed! I realize I could have easily had herpes long before my first symptoms and never known because I was never tested until I did have symptoms. 

I’ve had plenty of sex, casual or otherwise, and I’ve learned the best ways to disclose. Most people didn’t make it a big deal if I didn’t get emotional about it. 

I promise you’ll be ok. A lot of people get herpes younger than 24. I know people who were diagnosed at 18. Statistically, there’s pretty close to a 50/50 chance that’s you’d get it at some point anyways.

tjsdqd,"I truly appreciate you sending these resources because they may be beneficial to some but I would like to ask; what good would seeking help be besides attempting to cover up the facts of the matter? I can tell myself there is support for me out there but the barebones situation for me is that I am poisoned with an unenviable condition. After having many relationships fail before I had this happened to me, what is my hope?",2022-03-22 03:11:02,4

tjsdqd,I appreciate your input more than you'll ever know. I'm sure that you initially telling them was difficult but did you find that their reactions in those long term relations were difficult to manage? Were they maybe more understanding than you initially thought? I also understand if you don't want to share this.,2022-03-22 03:20:11,1
tjsdqd,I'm worried to take the antivirals over the side effects. That is a part of the problem. I just don't want to experience the inevitable rejections as well. I just want it all to end and wish it was a dream but I know everyone in my position feels that way.,2022-03-22 03:52:41,1

tjsdqd,Why bother commenting if you’re not actually going to offer any help?,2022-03-22 05:04:35,1
tjsdqd,I appreciate you sharing this. In my case I don't want to find a support group. With my mindset it won't help. I can't not dwell on this. Last night I was an idiot and got drunk and that's the only thing that got my mind off of the situation for even a second. Waking up this morning I just feel like I can't function. I can't focus on my work because none of this stupid shit I'm doing seems to matter now.,2022-03-22 14:40:04,1
tjsdqd,"The purpose of the groups is to meaningfully change your perspective - the hopelessness and poison and all that.

You used a great word here - “unenviable.”  Having herpes is certainly unenviable, but it’s also _not_ the end of life as you know it, it’s _not_ a nail in the coffin for finding love or happiness or any of that.  Not by any stretch.  Right now in your current (understandable) state of mind, you probably think I’m just being irrationally positive or brushing aside the harsh truth of the facts at hand.

But I’m not.  It’s really not as dire as you currently feel it is.  Again, your current perspective is quite understandable. I think it’s safe to say _everyone_ goes through that initial stage upon contracting.  But you should waste as little time as possible in that mindset.  It will be a self fulfilling prophecy as long as you remain there.

You’ve been presented with a new challenge.  Start working on adapting to the challenge.

You’ll still date.  You’ll still find love.  You won’t have to compromise.  This virus is both very common and it also seems like a much bigger deal than it is.

Some people benefit greatly from the support groups.  But your intuition is likely right - it’s a group therapy session that’s probably mostly encouragement and positivity and “you’re not alone” type of messaging.  I wouldn’t know because I’ve never participated in one and would never feel a need to.

My low-resolution read on you just from your post and comment here is that you’re probably more like me.  You want to engage with reality on a rational and factual basis.

My recommendation is hop on Google Scholar and start researching HSV.  Read the clinical papers about it.  Come to grasp the dispassionate truths of what it is and what it is not. Research how the virus operates in your nervous system, the family of viruses that HSV is in, research transmission variables and rates, recurrence variables and rates, the therapies that work and don’t work, etc.  

If you’re anything like me, you’ll quickly start to feel relief from that existential anxiety by doing so.  We’re also seriously close to vaccines and cures.  Like <5 years.  There’s no better time in history to become part of the 20-30% of the global population with genital HSV.

You’re going to be fine chief.  Keep your head up and that rational mind of yours engaged in productive digestion of the ultimately mostly harmless pathogen you now carry alongside a billion+ other humans currently alive.",2022-03-22 03:51:36,6

Long term responses... Honestly it just felt normal like relationship stuff. Sometimes I'd say ""hey I'm out of commission for a couple weeks"" or ""no sex right now"" or ""it's not a good time"" and they'd understand.

 1 in 10 women (or men) in your age cohort (aka your dating pool) already have genital herpes.  You’re not doomed to a sexless life or lowering your standards to find the one.  Countless other variables play a much larger role in narrowing dating pool.  Would you be better off without this extra variable? Mathematically - yes. Of course.

tjsdqd,"I appreciate you wanting to check and also offering your thoughts on this.

Now that I've sobered up after yesterday I'm in an even worse place mentally. I feel disgusting and that I'm just stuck now. From as young as I can remember I've had HSV-1. I've always understood it's something I can't get rid of but it didn't change my future. I haven't had any cold sore outbreaks for a long time now anyways. This is so much different. All I've wanted was to work hard and work on myself so I can get what I want in life to be truly happy and find a good person. Since my last breakup, I've only had 2 different sexual partners but have been dating around in which none of those situations worked out. This happening to me has derailed all of my plans to eventually find a good person for me like I wanted. Cold sores are one thing but to be poisoned with something that will cause me to change my life from this point forward is unbearable to me.

Hell even having a casual hookup is impossible now because I'll have to mention some fucking condition I have that can spread to them even if using protection. What a fucking joke this is. I was planning on going out with someone coming up shortly but I don't want to even want to meet them now or anyone new. If things happen to go well with them or anyone down the road I know I can't handle them looking at me like I'm disgusting and rejecting me.

I don't feel of this as a self-fulfilling prophecy type of thing but more of a harsh reality situation. I've researched this condition all week and any comfort I would find would be in a world where humans are rational thinking and would understand that this shouldn't be a deal breaker. But sadly life isn't that way.

At this point this comment is one big incohesive mess but your thoughts are very much valued and I appreciate you adding your input on this thread.",2022-03-22 15:22:11,2

tjzk4q,"Or if anyone has found out they had unprotected sex with a HSV+ person during and outbreak, but are still negative?",2022-03-22 10:08:52,1
tjzk4q,"well, over a span of A YEAR the woman has a 10% chance of contracting it without protection (sex 2-3 times a week), around 5% with antivirals and well below 1% with antivirals and condoms. keep in mind, this isn’t with every sexual act, it’s over the span of a year. i think per sexual act it’s about 0.0018%.",2022-03-22 15:47:02,1
tjzk4q,"If you are the male you need to be very careful while having an OB. It’s easier for you to pass it to a female, rather than a + female passing to a -male. 

Doesn’t guarantee she now has it but she should be cautious watching out for symptoms and moving forward use protection when you have an OB or think you’re getting one with anyone who is negative.",2022-03-22 22:14:22,1
tjzk4q,"I can say that I WAS a negative female, hooked up with an evidently positive male that did not have a visible outbreak. This happened the First time we hooked up. After him, I had my first disclosure that resulted in a relationship. He was very cool and fairly dismissive about it, I always kinda thought maybe he already had it or something because we definitely had unprotected sex during my many outbreaks. Mine are mild and I can’t/don’t take antivirals. I brought it up casually throughout the relationship, indirectly asking if he experienced an OB. Not together anymore but as far as I know/saw on his dick he never had an OB. Again, could be he already had it. Not a lot of data for you but that’s my experience 🙂",2022-03-23 06:38:23,1
tjzk4q,buuut I guess someone like this wouldn’t be lurking on a herpes forum lol…,2022-03-22 10:09:47,1
tjw3g2,"Nice, I wonder if what other people are taking to reduce outbreaks. Lysine sounds interesting, but I don't know anything of it..",2022-03-22 10:57:09,2
tjw3g2,"Yep it works amazingly well.  People are just odd in their militant avoidance of anything not in a published study.  🤷🏻‍♂️

How much are you taking?   You can always mini-cycle it.  Like take it M-F and off on weekends.  Kidney concerns at high doses for long periods.",2022-03-22 07:32:18,1
tjw3g2,"I got my first OB back at the start of the month. Immediately started to take L-Lysine, Red Marine Algae and Zinc all to help boost the immune system. So far only had the one OB. I have heard of people's bodies relying on it as well and as soon as they stop taking it they begin to have OBs. Obviously everyone's bodies work and function differently, some people have amazing immune systems and others don't so who knows. Probably the best thing you can do it just test it out yourself if you're really that curious, if you start to get prodromal symptoms again I would say it is helping you and you probably shouldn't stop. Also the types of food you eat can be a huge factor in the fact that there's many foods that are high in Arginine which from what I've read is a big helper in cultivating and allowing viruses to grow in the body.

&#x200B;

Some evidence suggests that high levels of arginine can make symptoms of herpes worse, potentially leading to outbreaks or cold sores. This is because the herpes virus needs arginine to multiply. Also, absorbing more arginine may indirectly cause cold sores by disrupting the body’s balance of arginine and another amino acid called lysine

Found this info here \~ [https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323259](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323259)

I also recently found a pretty awesome food chart for foods that are high/low in both arginine and lysine. [https://healingcycles.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/lysine\_arginine\_foods.pdf](https://healingcycles.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/lysine_arginine_foods.pdf)  
From what I've gathered from the chart you want to be eating the foods that are all 1.0+ or if you do eat some of the foods that fall under that category take a 500mg lysine pill afterwards to help negate and counter that.",2022-03-22 17:31:12,1

tk3vlw,Op seems overly sensitive...calm down I think people I trying to help here,2022-03-22 15:59:18,1
tk3vlw,"I’m in the same boat as you right now. Asymptomatic and unsure if I have it, but concerned about accidentally passing it on to someone else. You really just need to ask yourself - Would you be able to live with yourself in the off-chance that you DO asymptomatically have it and gave it to someone else who ended up experiencing symptoms from it?

If your answer is no, that you couldn’t live with yourself, then there’s really nothing to do besides get tested and check if you have it. 

On the other hand, if you could live with that scenario happening, then stop worrying until you have a reason to (like observing visible sores).

At the end of the day, it all comes down to who you are. I have friends with HSV who got tested and diagnosed, always disclose, and have wonderful sex lives still. But I also know people who don’t always disclose (like the person I may have contracted it from) and as long as they can live with that, then I’m sure their life will be just great as well.",2022-03-22 16:21:04,1
tk3vlw,"This is just an opinion do with it as you wish! I would not get tested with a regular IgG or a IGM test. Only get tested if have an active sore that can be swabbed or you are willing to pay for a western blot test! Lots of people have herpes and don’t even know! They don’t put the test on a standard panel of STD test for a reason! Save yourself the trouble unless you’re willing to pay for the right test or again can swab a sore. That’s just my opinion! I myself personally, got tested without any physical symptoms or anything and was given a false positive, wasted a lot of money, A lot of unnecessary pain and worry",2022-03-22 18:20:30,1
tk3vlw,No. Absolutely not. The CDC says not to test without symptoms.  I agree.,2022-03-22 22:23:22,1

No do not get tested without symptoms you probably don’t have it",2022-03-22 23:20:23,1
tk3vlw,And what is that supposed to mean? I’m asking legitimate questions I’m not looking for anybody to be rude or smart mouthed. Thanks,2022-03-22 14:38:55,0
tk3vlw,I’m not getting tested for it and I don’t think that makes me a bad person. Hsv 1 is extremely common and most people contract it as a child so why should I get a test when I have no symptoms just to see if I have it. I could’ve kissed or been intimate with people who had antibodies for hsv 1 prior to even meeting my ex and still never caught it. And most people don’t even know their hsv status I just think it’s a waste of time to get this worked up over cold sores especially with no symptoms and a negative igg and igM test after we broke up.,2022-03-22 16:38:19,2
tk3vlw,"Just curious, how did you find out it was a false positive? Western blot or something similar?",2022-03-22 19:12:53,1
tk3vlw,"Just curious, how did you find out it was a false positive? Western blot or something similar?",2022-03-22 19:13:11,1
tk3vlw,I think he was saying by your post it seems getting tested would help you cause you're pretty worked up about it don't think bad intentions with this response just how you read it,2022-03-22 16:01:00,2
tk3vlw,"I apologize, I wasn’t trying to be rude. I’m just saying if not knowing is wrecking your mind this much than it’s probably better to just get the test and know for sure.",2022-03-22 14:55:44,1
tk3vlw,"No I don’t think it makes you a bad person. But if you’re not the type of person that can live with the thought of possibly transmitting it, then what else are you going to do besides get tested, ya know? I think the main thing to focus on is doing whatever you need to do (testing or not testing) to gain peace of mind.",2022-03-22 19:10:22,1
tk3vlw, Yes I had a false positive index the first IgG test was 1.17 tested again with IGG 2.02 and then was western blot negative! So I will never get tested again unless I have an active sore!,2022-03-22 19:16:26,2
tk3vlw,I was just looking for advice on how to handle the situation. I don’t feel like going through the mental distress if I’ve never had symptoms or an outbreak yet I’m not sure if I’m entirely wrong for not getting tested because I know I was exposed. Sometimes when I read up here people make hsv 1 seem like a big deal but every doctor I’ve talked to about this situation has told me it’s very common and I shouldn’t bother to be tested. I just wanna be responsible I guess,2022-03-22 15:07:11,1
tk3vlw,Wow that’s crazy! Thanks for sharing!,2022-03-22 20:29:09,1
tk3vlw,I think the responsible thing to do is to get the test. Even if it is common there’s still people that don’t have it and it can be very painful for someone who contracts it and has the misfortune of having symptoms and frequent outbreaks.,2022-03-22 15:17:02,1
tk3vlw,"You’re welcome. You seem like a nice person and it’s good to be concerned for others. My advice going through an experience like this, is regardless it’s not a death sentence it’s only a skin condition. People make it bigger than it needs to be, I would actually date and be with someone with this no problem, I would just protect myself the best way I can. Anytime you have sex with anyone there’s a risk, so make sure The person is worth the risk. If people would just educate themselves I think we would all understand this is not really a big deal",2022-03-22 21:26:48,2
tk3vlw,Okay but the person I’m dating probably has the virus anyways… idk if it’s necessary I’ve never had symptoms or an outbreak. I could’ve dated someone with it in the past who didn’t know they had it as well and never caught it.,2022-03-22 15:21:58,1
tk3vlw,He could also have hsv 2 or hiv or chlamydia. Why not both get tested for everything?,2022-03-22 15:25:20,1
tk3vlw,He was tested for everything and I was as well. When did I say he wasn’t? Where are you getting that information for?,2022-03-22 15:26:08,1
tk3vlw,"To be honest, from a third party perspective, it sounds like you’re getting pretty defensive by someone giving you an answer you don’t like to a question that you seem to already know the answer to. I’ve done the same thing where I worry incessantly about something and ask for an outside opinion, and when they don’t give me the reassurance I am directly looking for, I get defensive and come up with every reason to go against them. Bottom line is, if you’re that worried about it, go get a test for some peace of mind. Even if a doctor says “I don’t think that’s necessary” you have every right to be like “but I would like to be sure, please have the test done”. Even if you’re pretty sure you don’t have it, there’s nothing wrong with getting it done just to solidify that fact and get rid of any anxiety towards giving it to someone else.",2022-03-22 16:25:03,3
tk3vlw,You said the person you’re dating “probably has the virus anyways” I assumed that meant he hasn’t been tested for everything since you don’t know if he has the virus or not.,2022-03-22 15:31:49,1
tk3vlw,As I just stated. I am not concerned about asking people to get tested for herpes. It is not recommended for a reason. I am more concerned about accidentally passing it on. I have literally stated that twice,2022-03-22 15:33:29,1
tk3vlw,I’ve already answered that question. The only way to prevent accidentally spreading it is to get tested and know your status for sure.,2022-03-22 15:44:03,1
tk3vlw,Okay thanks for your perspective I would like to talk to somebody else who has actually read through my post and answered my questions tho.,2022-03-22 15:46:21,2
tk2zep,"2. Get tested. Type 2 usually doesn’t occur as often orally. 
3. You can still transfer it to genitals but chances are low. 
4. Valtrex/acyclovir/famvir are used to combat hsv. Either take them as a daily suppression or just when breaking out.",2022-03-22 13:58:45,2
tk2zep,Thanks very much for the advice! Will get tested tomorrow,2022-03-22 14:22:51,1
tjur19,"Sending you lots of love. Let’s hope for a cure. 

Maybe don’t disclose until someone gets to know you. I don’t have advice. I found out when I was pregnant and tested without my knowledge. I am still technically not single and haven’t tried dating yet. But I believe someone out there will know you have more worth than a skin rash. 

I think there should be a Reddit group for people to meet and date with hsv. Maybe you can make one.",2022-03-22 06:22:21,3
tjur19,For men it's a lot harder. Women can disclose and have sex (intimacy) maybe not marriage/relationship but that's still affection from the opposite sex whereas men disclose and it's not passing the talking stage much less a date. It's normally a whole lotta rejection. But it's not an easy road,2022-03-22 10:31:49,2
tjur19,So you say emotionally manipulate them.  Getting them to fall for you before this issue is addressed.   This is what happened to me.  There is.

tjoje9,Me. Constant red peeled off skin and sores coming and going. Tested negative for over a year with my last negative results coming through yesterday. I’ve decided to let this go. The creams I’ve been using have been helping and reducing my stress. The body does weird things sometimes,2022-03-22 01:22:55,3
tjoje9,I’m hoping this is the case for me. I had a negative test in January. Unprotected sex in feb with a past partner and a few days later had 2 bumps appear. I went to the er she said it didn’t look like typical herpes but I had a lot of new discharge and ended up positive for something called mgen. She still gave me antivirals as a precaution and so I’m waiting my 12 weeks to be tested again. My bumps never blistered or scabbed over but there was tingling. I had some tingling today and see a bump the same as last time so I’m waiting to see what happens. I’m assuming the worse until my next blood test,2022-03-22 02:21:19,3

tjoje9,Rash that turned to blisters that took a couple weeks to clear up. Never scabbed over like a classic outbreak but I was convinced and reddit had told me it was possibly herpes which i took to mean 100%. I even started taking valtrex before I got my results back.,2022-03-22 00:07:02,4
tjoje9,"Same… I got sores but nothing blistered, they literally just disappeared. The doctor did a swab and blood test and said it’s genital hsv1 but a part of me is still hoping it was just a false positive 😅",2022-03-22 04:39:42,2
tjoje9,i’m sorry if this is personal but did you have any swelling/redness/itchiness/discharge? i’m dealing with that right now and i have a doctors appointment tomorrow to test but i have a ton of anxiety.,2022-03-22 01:28:49,1

tk5dyz,"Save yourself the embarrassment & move on with your life. Herpes absolutely sucks & it sucks even more to be lied to but none of this is worth it. Hell, if by some miracle this would ever go to court, the chances even your judge & attorney have HSV are fairly high. Do yourself a favor & go live your life.",2022-03-22 19:30:12,7
tk5dyz,"You would need written or verbal proof of them admitting that they knew, you’d probably need a copy of their test results. You’d also need your printed negative test results from before you contracted it to prove that it wasn’t dormant in your system. 

If this is a money issue, I can understand why you’d want to sue. If this is for revenge or to teach someone a lesson, just remember that, unfortunately, it won’t change your status, or your symptoms (which will likely subside with time if you’re like most people), you’ll still have to find a way to live without letting the mental weight consume you (which you can, because I know many people who have and have myself), and you’ll still have to learn to disclose (which you also can do).

Suing this person might get you money, but it won’t force them to disclose in the future, and it won’t make your herpes go away. Most people who take legal action against their gifter decide that it’s more of a headache and even more emotionally draining. If you can’t prove that this person gave you herpes, you could even lose money to them. 

Best of luck moving forward. We’re here for support.",2022-03-22 17:29:27,7

Don’t try insinuating whether I disclose or not as that’s not what I was commenting on at all.

Herpes can be managed, yea it can be intrusive, it can cause pain, but it’s also blown way out of proportion, by people like you. I know I won’t change your mind, it’s only worth a reply because I like to try and give people perspective and hope on here, not type negativity and fear, as you do.

Secondly...  he can't sue you.  In certain states he can but in Denmark or Canada (me) no he cannot. So even if you had lied and never told him.. he still can't lol  he's shit out of luck.

tjehjy,"No, no - you aren't stupid. Medication is a personal decision, and for females to males, with just avoiding sex during outbreaks, it's a 4% chance of transmission per year. 

If you add daily suppressives, it's a 2% chance per year. Statistically, that's not that significant of a difference. 

Your ex is an ass who doesn't deserve you, and don't spend a minute blaming yourself. He took his chances, you were honest, and now he's being a big jerk.

You are not alone, you won’t ever be.
You need to shine as much as possible Hsv doesn’t define you. Even when others are not as strong as you are. Don’t look at the world from inside your mind and what your eyes can see.
The world is a big place and there are plenty of people, whom would love to spend a day by your side, more over a lifetime. But you need to shine and only you can’t see this. Think about this I met the love of my life, and found out I have it on my hands HSV-2 but it was enough to put me to the side. So best thing I can do is shine shine and shine, reprogram my mind to believe what is true.

This is not an accurate depiction of what it’s like to live with herpes especially because most people who post here are newly diagnosed and are panicking because they’re now exploring unknown territory.

At 4 months, it's still a new infection, and hard to predict. If you stop the lysine, and get an outbreak, it doesn't mean it's the lysine, it could just be your infection. 

Also, you have antibodies now. Your body has done all it is going to do. Things will settle down, but some people get more frequent outbreaks than others. It doesn't mean your body isn't handling it. It's the very nature of the virus - it recurs. It's not a failure or something if you get recurrences. 

If you have ghsv1, you might have far fewer recurrences than with ghsv2, so that's a consideration, too. Ghsv1 averages 1 outbreak a year, ghsv2 averages 4-5 a year.",2022-03-22 01:50:47,1

If this would have been your initial outbreak, most people who have noticeable symptoms describe it as serious pain and discomfort, not mild. Most people *know* it’s herpes because of the distinct feeling. 

That being said, some people have mild symptoms for their first outbreak, and if you’re worried about it you can get tested. Keep in mind that if you have a blood test done, that doesn’t mean that it’s a new infection. You could have contracted it before meeting your fiancé and been asymptomatic since (which isn’t uncommon).",2022-03-22 18:49:07,1

tjrkjx,"Sounds like it’s not herpes. 

I caught herpes while wearing a condom (which I didn’t even know was possible) and the only affected area was that around the base of my dick that wasn’t covered by the condom. 

If you’re worried get a blood test done. Ask for igg specifically. If you do test positive, that doesn’t mean it’s a new infection. You could have contracted it a while ago and just been asymptomatic. 

If you test negative, understand that a *lot* of people have HSV, either 1 or 2. Most of those people are asymptomatic, so they don’t even know they have it. So even if you ask someone “do you have herpes?” And they say “no I don’t,” the only way to really know is to ask to see their printed igg numbers. After asking a handful of people, you’ll start to realize that isn’t really a sustainable way of protecting yourself from herpes. Many people have had cold sores since childhood, so while they’ll say they don’t have herpes, they can still pass it to you orally through kissing or genitally through oral sex. 

Basically, herpes is super illusive, peoples test results flip flop, most people who have it are asymptomatic and unaware, so you can do your best to avoid it, but there’s really no telling who has it! It’s best just to use protection and get tested regularly.",2022-03-22 18:54:50,3
tjrkjx,"Thank you for your response, the part currently experiencing issues was covered but I did have some unprotected sex around 20 days ago so I guess that could be the route as well? But I read 2-10 days is the typical period and a large drop off. 

Nothing has really changed since yesterday and the sting isn’t unbearable just every now and again and annoying, I even showered without pain using soap so it’s weird. The part of the skin is just a tad bit whiter than the rest but that’s what makes me think it may blister. 

If you don’t mind I have a couple other questions for you if you’d have an option them? 

What do sores typically look like at early stages? I read they are usually bumps not what looks like just a white part of my skin. 
Would anything else to your knowledge potentially cause something like this?

tjcd2g,"When I was using apps more regularly, I would disclose usually by the first or second date. It would always vary. 

I suggest “practice disclosures” with people that you’re not that attracted to at first so it’s low stakes. If they reject you, it’s whatever because you’re not even that attracted to them. This gets you used to the feeling of saying it out loud, and let’s you practice how to handle different reactions. Not a waste of time at all in my opinion and I’m glad I took the time to have these practice dates. 

Just remember that there are MILLIONS of people out there, herpes or not, so don’t put so much value into what one hot/funny/smart/wealthy person thinks of you. Even if they tick all those boxes and reject you, there is someone else who will also tick those boxes and won’t give a shit or has herpes themselves. Don’t take it personally, if they reject you it’s much more about their lack of education about HSV than it is about you.

Transmission reports with GHSV-1 are unheard of outside of an outbreak. It’s probably the least harsh strain to have to deal with. 

Washing your hands constantly isn’t going to change nothing. Obviously keep up normal hygiene but washing constantly isn’t going to be of any advantage whatsoever.

I was diagnosed a week ago and i was stressed in the beginning but I turned around within a couple days.

It just isn't gonna feel great to hear about someone that was with a partner but too worried to have sex with them and 10 months on is worried to have sex with anyone cause there's a chance they could have it even though they don't know at all.

I'm mostly saying this for people I know in this group are insecure about it cause I personally don't care.

But as far as what Id say to you. I got it from receiving unprotected oral from someone that was asymptomatic so it can happen. Doesn't mean it definitely did.  If you are testing negative and have no symptoms, don't assume you have it. Just test for it between partners if you want but don't stress yourself. 

Also if you're this worried do be aware most people have hsv1 and hsv2 is also pretty common and most people who have it don't know. So any future partners could have it too and if you care as much as you seem to you should make sure you know their status.

Yes, absolutely. That's 5 months. Antibodies develop within 3 months, and that's all it takes.

>0.90 for hsv 2

Are you sure it said that exactly, or did it say <.90, which means less than .90, which would mean anywhere under .90, clearly negative. If he had contracted hsv2, that number would have been positive by the time he tested 5 months later. 

You can test, but you were only at risk for hsv1, both orally and genitally. If you test positive, there is no way of knowing when you acquired it - from him, or some time in your childhood or from someone else you kissed or got oral from. Since you haven't had genital symptoms, it's very unlikely that you have it genitally. 

The hsv1 IgG test misses 30% of infections. There's no way of knowing if your previous tests missed yours unless you get a Western Blot test, which is expensive, and without symptoms, kind of pointless. You'd have no idea where you have it - oral or genital - if you test positive, though statistically, it would be oral.

67% of people under 50 globally have hsv1. Hsv1 isn't really anything to freak out this much about. Let it go.",2022-03-22 02:29:40,1

Don’t even bother testing unless you have symptoms",2022-03-22 03:14:30,1
tjpoet,"I’ve had herpes for almost two years now. In my personal (yet unpopular) opinion it’s not worth getting tested unless you have symptoms. 

If you test positive for HSV1, many professionals advise non-disclosure. Disclose to a handful of people, it only takes a few negative experiences to understand why. People are hypocrites. You’ll say “hey for your safety I need to let you know I have oral herpes,” they’ll say “gross no thanks,” you’ll say “well it’s just cold sores,” they’ll say “no it’s not, everyone gets cold sores. Hardly anyone has herpes.” At least this has been my experience. 

Let’s imagine you do have herpes. What’s different about your life now? You don’t have symptoms, it doesn’t sound like you’re disclosing to new partners, and until you have a positive test, why would you? If you’re worried about the morality of it, you can tell new partners “hey my last partner had herpes but we never had penetrative sex, I’ve never had symptoms and I’ve never tested positive for it since.”

Let’s imagine a scenario where you play it safe, you’re celibate until you know for a fact that you are negative for a virus that more than 50% have some type of (1 or 2). Even then, are you really stopping the spread? If you’re slowing it, it’s only marginally. People will continue to have sex, however safe, knowing their status or not, disclosing or not, and herpes will continue to do it’s thing. 

I’m the scenario that you are negative for herpes, so many people carry it asymptomatically and are unaware that the very next person you sleep with who thinks they’re “clean” could be the person who does in fact give it to you. And if not them, the next person you kiss, so on and so forth. 

Basically herpes is a phantom that’s omnipresent and there’s really only so much you can do to avoid it. You can ask to see peoples printed igg levels, but then you have to take their word that they haven’t been physical with anyone since their test. You also have to hope that they were tested after the undetectable period of 2-4 months. If they were tested immediately after their last exposure, there’s a high chance the test is inaccurate. 

I’m just some guy on the internet, speaking from my experience and the other stories I’ve heard from the sub and other people with herpes that I know in real life. Take it with a grain of salt, but my advice is don’t stress. If you end up getting herpes, it’s not the end of the world. Like at all. My heart goes out to those who deal with constant symptoms, but that likely won’t be you.",2022-03-22 19:16:25,1
tjpoet,I didn’t not have sex with my ex because I was too scared of catching herpes I didn’t have sex with him because I’m a virgin and I personally didn’t feel ready to go that far.

tjpoet,Okay so if I do get tested and its positive should I assume I have it genitally as well? I’ve never had an outbreak or anything. Someone once told me that genital hsv 1 usually appears right after an individual contracts it and it doesn’t stay dormant for long periods of time. Is there any truth to that? Are people still able to perform oral sex on their partners if they have oral hsv 1 like should every person who’s been intimate with someone who gets cold sores assume they have it genitally?,2022-03-23 02:02:00,1
tjpoet,Ah Im sorry I read that wrong as being because of herpes and did assume. The rest of what I said stands though. If results and symptoms don't point to you having it I don't think you should worry. And sex of course can still be safe if you do and doesn't need to be avoided as for whatever else you are thinking could give it to someone you'd want to date like kissing.,2022-03-22 03:47:32,2

tjpoet,Okay great you should closely monitor for symptoms for the next month or two. After which you can forget about it,2022-03-22 03:33:23,1
tjpoet,"There is no way to tell whether you have it orally or genitally unless you have symptoms. At least to my knowledge. 

As far as symptoms appearing soon after contraction, that might be true in some cases, but definitely not universally true. There are married people who post on the sub that say they’ve been married for years, don’t suspect cheating, and have their first symptoms seemingly out of nowhere, likely triggered by stress. Sometimes one tests positive, assumes the other is cheating, and yet the other tests negative. 

I’ve definitely received oral from people with ohsv1 because I wasn’t aware that cold sores were herpes. They didn’t have symptoms, so I didn’t contract it. 

Having sex, oral or penetrative, with someone who is herpes positive, type 1 or type 2, doesn’t guarantee transmission. There’s a higher chance during an outbreak, and still a small chance without symptoms, but sex with someone HSV+ =/= transmission.",2022-03-23 02:09:08,1

I slept with one other person in that time period but we used protection and it was too close to when my symptoms developed so wasn't enough time for it to be them.

There's one other person it could have been to be fair. I just feel like I know. If it was the other one then it laid dormant for a month and then symptoms were triggered by rough sex and developing a UTI potentially.",2022-03-22 18:31:16,1

I highly doubt it's not HSV. I have faliculitus on my chest when I shave, I don't get shiny red skin and 5 or so clear blisters grouped together that itch like crazy.

I was absolutely mortified when I got it and thought life was over. I did some research into what causes flare ups, and how to avoid them. At that point it essentially becomes a super power, it helps you understand when you're not at your healthiest. I've had a few bumps here and there questioning if it'll be an outbreak, but in the 3 years since my first ob, I've only had one, and also met the love of my life on a dating app. (Not everyone is this lucky unfortunately). 

It helps you find the sincere people so easily, because a good person won't care if you occasionally get some pimples down there. I've had people react grossly and I just write them off as someone who's opinion I don't care about. 

All in all, do some research, get a really good understanding of what it is and how it effects you. Look into getting treated medically for it if necessary, there's medicine that can help reduce the outbreaks. There's vaccines and cures in the works, most likely within our lifetime, if that's something that ends up being necessary for you to hope for. Definitely read previous stories on this subreddit and you'll see time and time again, people either are ready to give up on life because of it, or they've lived through it and see it's an extremely insignificant part of life.",2022-03-21 15:25:13,5

I understand medically what it is and that it really isn't a big deal, but the unfortunate reality is that people will see me differently because of it, whether it's warranted or not. I agree with the other comments/stories on here that the stigma of herpes is really what causes issues. However, I don't think that the public view of herpes will ever change, until like you said, there is some type of cure/vaccine for it.

tjdf72,"It's one of those things that only experience will be able to provide the comfort and answers you're looking for. It really bothered me for a few months, but then I met my girlfriend and she was just like ""oh ok, well pretty much everyone has it in one form or another and you're still you"". That moment for me was a lot of clarity I needed to hear and experience. Since then I don't even really think about it at all at this point. It's truly no more intrusive in your life than a big ol pimple on your face may be. Ya it's a Lil gross, but if someone makes you feel bad for something literally everyone goes through in some form (skin irriation/pimples) then fuck em! I wish for the best for you truly! Times have changed a lot since even I initially got it 3 years ago, but stay confident in yourself, and if you weren't, then find that confidence! You're still the exact same person you were before, now with even more awareness and experience. Don't let it define you or your life. The right people won't bat an eye when you mention it and those are the people you want to be friends with. It's a great judge of character. 

Seriously, I found myself using that diagnosis as a way to exemplify the negativity in my life. I wasn't confident prior to getting it, so getting it absolutely destroyed my confidence. Maybe try working out, doing something YOU care about and getting good at it, eating right, could all be options to feeling healthier. It sounds so dumb from your end I'm sure, like oh of course, take care of myself thanks. 

I just bring this all up because my diagnosis, although life ruining at first, turned me into an extremely confident person as I tried to fix it by maxing out my other stats. It's not a bad thing unless you structure your thoughts into thinking it's a bad thing. This could be life providing you a way to spark that fire you needed to do what you always wanted. The first outbreak is also always so so so much worse than the rest. My first was horrendous, now it's no different than just a little razor burn.

Sorry for ranting, that's all just assurance I would've loved to have gotten before. Try to keep your head up and look for the positives in the situation. Just because other people in life deem it as a bad thing doesn't mean you can't deem it a good thing. Good luck my friend!",2022-03-21 17:40:24,4
tjdf72,"I'm lucky enough that my outbreaks have never been severe enough to warrant the prescription (outside of the first one). There's a specific list of foods to avoid, but in general its just avoid fatty unhealthy food. Surprisingly though I've heard broccoli can increase outbreak chances but I still eat it lol. I think of it as something that's a little more sensitive than normal acne. 

The way I think of it is that it's essentially just acne that triggers a little easier than normal acne. If eating greasy foods, drinking milk, shaving etc cause acne normally, it'll cause flare ups even easier. If a lifestyle change has helped you remove acne in the past, it'll likely help here. Also in general keeping as strong an immune system as you can, since it is a virus. Staying healthy in general is definitely a good preventative. My second worst outbreak was rather recently and I definitely attribute it to be Hella lazy and eating a ton of junk food for like a month. Thats why it's like a super power, it gives you free motivation to be healthy lol.

tjdf72,When you say the state of your genitals would you mind describing?,2022-03-21 16:25:23,1
tjdf72,"Diagnosed at 23, currently 26. I've most likely had many more outbreaks, but I get ingrown hairs rather easily, so any outbreaks that have occurred since diagnosed have been insignificant enough to me to not be able to tell if its an ob or just normal ingrown hairs. At most, I just get a few red spots that are very tiny. In terms of big outbreaks, I had the first one, then one recently where it was clearly an outbreak due to how it spread on contact and noticeably different than normal ingrown hairs. 

The diet stuff I was never sure of, I read that foods with a certain chemical (can't recall the name) can intensify an outbreak, like broccoli or brussel sprouts. I ended up not having any difference either way. 

In general when this happened I switched from eating junk food and being seriously inactive to a completely Mediterranean diet, mostly eating veggies and avoiding red meat. I also ran a few miles everyday. That being an extreme contrast to who I was a before definitely made me feel good and boosted my immune system. A weak immune system is one of the main triggers for an outbreak as well. Again too, this is just my personal experience with it. I cared a lot at first, adopted a super healthy lifestyle (went from 260 to 190), and have since just coasted on that new lifestyle, not really experiencing any issues with hsv nor do I really even remember I have it 99% of the time. I just recently developed /got diagnosed with lactose intolerance at the same time I was eating a ton of junk food and pizza (back up to 220 lol), and at the tail-end of that binge is when I had my second big outbreak.

In general I'd just advise staying as healthy as possible, in whatever way works and feels healthy to YOU. If foods give you stomach aches, or breakouts, listen to your body and don't eat that food. If a part of your body aches, work it out until it doesn't ache the same. Drink a ton of water and stay hydrated. It sounds kind of pseudo-scientific which I hate (I like to know how things work). But it really does work, it eventually becomes almost like a 6th sense and in my experience, really helped me to understand my own body a lot more.",2022-03-22 11:58:02,1

tjdf72,"As abstract as it sounds, you are quite literally what you eat. I think eating healthy is certainly the biggest thing you can do to having a good immune system. Working out is the next best thing. Other than that it's more like avoiding certain things; bad air, getting sick, drinking, smoking, too much red meat, etc. Getting bloodwork done can tell you what you may be lacking or consuming that is doing more harm than good. That's not to say I never eat a burger, drink or smoke. I just recommend do everything in moderation and always try to make sure you're getting all of the nutrients you need.

The blood igg tests can take a while it come back positive if someone does have hsv , up to 12 weeks .  So testing too soon can miss positive cases. And some people even with OB don’t test positive with igg , misses 30 % of hsv1 & 8 % of hsv2.  If you have been exposed to a hsv + partner it doesn’t  mean you will absolutely become infected , if they aren’t having an OB or virally shedding then the risk is lower.",2022-03-21 16:46:43,1

Ask for several refills of antivirals so you don’t have to wait around when you get OB. Go get any bumps swabbed and get some meds for the yeast infection. Any time you get antibiotic ask for a subscription for yeast and just take it directly after finishing the antibiotic. It will save you discomfort in the long run.

Clearly this chick ain't that concerned about stds ..please ask her to get tested and in the future ask partners to get a test before disclosing.
Just read your update. She sounds really uneducated . If she doesn't already have hsv1 * which I guarantee she does) and she's that concerned about it ,she needs to pull a Howard Hughs and isolate in her basement the rest of her life.",2022-03-21 02:41:49,31

I felt so awful and came clean to her on the spot. She was pissed obviously. I still feel like I’ve committed a crime against humanity or something, but we’ve had constructive conversations since. Make sure you’re supportive in any way you can be. I think making sure your hu knows that you are genuinely compassionate and understanding of the situation she may be in goes a long way. Also, I don’t know if this applies to you, but as a college student, I’m probably drunk more than I should be and my incident really made me reflect on the way alcohol affects my judgement.

Try reaching out to the person via call or in-person and explain your situation. It's going to be a difficult conversation but letting the person know will allow them to get tested and prevent them from potentially exposing someone else.

One girls comment here last week really stuck with me.  She was talking about how she and her boyfriend have had unprotected sex for like six years and he’s never gotten it from her, because she simply avoids having sex when she senses prodrome coming on. 

And it’s been 100% successful.  

A bunch of people warned her that she’s still a walking “asymptomatic shedder” no matter what and she replied:   

“Lol.  People around here really hate themselves”.

I have participated in several other chronic health condition groups and the majority of them focus on medical and alternative ways of fixing the fucking problem. 👍🏼 Sharing stories and anecdotes and tips and tricks for improvement and getting back to life. 

Because at the end of the day that’s the only way you actually feel better. This unfortunately is one of those subs where I can’t find a single person talking about that stuff. 

It’s probably because most people here are newly diagnosed and those who have chronic outbreaks. But that’s why maybe there should be a separate sub for them.",2022-03-21 19:36:13,2

Some have frequent outbreaks and some have none, some get tingling and pain every time and some times it there’s no warning. Outbreaks usually get less and less frequent over time. I’ve had about four outbreaks in the last year and 3 hurt and one I nearly didn’t notice. The first outbreak was definitely the worst! Sex is a trigger for mine so I got prescribed antivirals and I take them every now and again if I’m worried I’m about to breakout so try and speak to a doctor to get some urgently if you’re worried but chances are even if you are about to have an outbreak it won’t be as bad and over time it’ll get less painful and less frequent.

I’ve heard of people with HSV taking daily acyclovir to help with suppression. Also, waiting a week after an outbreak heals also helps to decrease the risk. But with that being said the risk is always there, no matter how many steps you take to lower the risk. People with hsv can shed the virus without having symptoms. I think the bigger question is if the risk of having unprotected sex with your partner outweighs you getting hsv.

tj2z0o,"Hi there!:) I’m definitely no expert, I just recently got diagnosed myself. Just from my experience so far (and also looking at doses online), usually the course of acyclovir is 5-10 days. Maybe you just needed a longer dose? I worked in the OBGYN clinic for a couple of years as a nurse, and sometimes patients came for yeast infections or BV, and we would give them a typical dose of meds. Sometimes they’d come back needing a longer dose. It looks like it *could* be herpes. Sometimes when I get outbreaks I’ll itch a lot and irritate my skin, so it gets murky as to what are actual lesions and what are cuts. But it looks rounded and filled like herpes can look like.

tih3fl,"I have been with about 25 men and 6 women , and no one has ever told me they have hsv. Even several who I knew had cold sores as I'd seen them. With the men (after my 2nd and his friend told me he had hpv/genital warts) if it's going to be a refular thing and I want to not use condoms anymore I required mutual testing.  However this usually doesn't include hsv. I was never that worried about it to begin with but i know alot of people say they'd never sleep w someone with herpes, yet they've never been tested,  don't use condoms and never ask partners for a test.  The hypocrisy is absurd. And no, I don't intend to disclose that I tested positive for hsv2. I've never had an outbreak I'm not going to waste my time on people who obviously don't care. , i think.its ridiculous.  I will continue to require negative tests for  chlamydia,  gonorrhea,  syphilis,  hiv and hepatitis before sex. But Herpes?? Lol. Nope .",2022-03-20 15:18:40,7
tih3fl,"No one has ever disclosed to me. I’m 22F. I’ve been with 26 people and I have GHSV2. 
I’m planning on disclosing to people but it’s hard to think about how many people will judge me. I had sex freely before (I will too in the future), but it’s put a strain on that part of me mentally. It frustrates me that it’s expected of me to be upfront and open, when they don’t even ask me or get tested themselves - and most of them try to get out of using condoms (I was always the one pressuring to use it). And then I’m the one who gets it :))

The thing that makes me want to disclose is that I want to break the stigma. I also don’t want to end up liking someone and then having to disclose after multiple rounds of sex/hook ups. It would break the trust. I would be upset if that happened to me too.",2022-03-20 20:13:01,7

tih3fl,"24 (F) - I have HSV 2 and honestly I’m on the dreaded medication daily that’s fucked up and altered my taste, I don’t have casual sex anymore, so to me I’m taking a lot of preventative measures. I myself became super educated on it so when the time does come to disclosure I have the facts and confidence to do so. But I guess what I struggle with is my boundaries with disclosure ya know? Because I’d really hate to be really into someone, haven’t done anything sexual and then break the news months later and them freaking out and leaving - resulting in time wasted. The stigma is insane. The guy who had given it to me thought it was included on STD panels and he was asymptomatic and I got it. I can’t even be mad because he didn’t know like MANY people don’t because there is no routine testing and a lot of people are asymptomatic as well as scared to disclose. The double standards of “I’d never sleep with someone with herpes” “herpes is dirty” …but when you confront those same people they have NEVER been tested. I’ve had many people go that route with the sigma (it wasn’t brought up with me having it) and I got really defensive because I’m living it and people have NO idea until it’s you. Sorry to rant on but man I cannot stand the stigma and I’m so disappointed and the lack of education on it.",2022-03-20 18:23:59,4

tih3fl,What do you mean?,2022-03-20 21:15:28,1
tih3fl,"no i dont feel really guilty. because for one if you get an std panel herpes usually isnt tested for unless requested, so if the CDC doesn’t think its a big deal then why should I? additionally 60% of people with herpes are asymptomatic and may never know they have it so if were not actively testing AND people are going around hooking up not knowing they have herpes then why am I going to ostracize myself because I have minor visible symptoms that appear very rarely and very shortly

but it also comes down to the fact i don’t believe there are “good people” or “bad people”, I believe that were all on a spectrum and oscillate around fluidly. yeah, not disclosing is bad but I don’t think it makes you a bad person.

but for context i definitely think there are times when disclosure is necessary and your intuition will usually let you know

oh and lastly if someone asks you upfront about it don’t ever lie about it thats extremely fucked up",2022-03-20 17:16:09,7

tih3fl,Im a bottom and always have been so. and like i said i’ve never had a top disclose. I think if the goal is normalization of herpes then we shouldn’t have to preemptively disclose unless you feel an outbreak. if you’re worried then always wear condoms or be monogamous with someone because 60% of hsv+ people are asymptomatic and many of those people have no idea they have it because its not being actively tested for during std panels.,2022-03-21 02:06:38,1

tih3fl,"No one cares dude. People say they care ,but if they truly did they would demand a negative test before every sexual encounter.  No one does that. The ""you clean?

Lolol that's like disclosing you had chicken pox in 1993. I will never disclose. And these people on this site are the only ones doing that.  Its unheard of IRL .

tih3fl,"so would you still not disclose if the sex were unprotected? what about oral sex? don’t you find it the least bit unethical to not even give someone the option to be at risk or not? 

I do agree that it’s different in the hookup community, everyone is always at risk then.

I know that standard STD panels don’t include herpes, but that typically means the people who are diagnosed get outbreaks. which typically means higher viral shedding (sometimes even with antivirals). I just think that warrants a little “hey, I have genital herpes, do you have any questions about that”.",2022-03-21 04:48:06,1
tih3fl,"Yea look it hasn’t been fun.

But those are people I wouldn’t want around me if that’s something that makes them that uncomfortable! 

What happens if you lie and do get with someone and it becomes something. I don’t think i could trust someone that tells me AFTER the fact that they knowingly kept it from me just to sleep with me. 

I understand the frustration. This shit threw me in a total loop and completely fucked up my life. And I’d be lying if I said I didn’t think about doing it too. Just not saying anything and sleeping around again; and then I remember how upset I was that first day and I just can’t do that to someone else without their consent.",2022-03-21 05:46:05,1

I had my first ""noticeable "" classic herpes outbreak with sores. I most likely was asymptomatic or very mildly symptomatic that I attributed my symptoms to something else because there were no sores or blisters present. 

Honestly I'm not doing great mentally, struggling really hard. The ob it's self lasted about a week and I just have an itch now. It was a tiny small cluster of 3 very small blisters, they hurt like hell at first because it was on a very sensitive part of me. So in terms of that I guess I was lucky.

We didn’t choose to be in this position. 
After that 1 month ob I kind of convinced my self my body ‘got over it’ but I received another. For yourself I would be somewhat prepared for another one, and if it doesn’t happen then you have more to celebrate about. Acyclovir has been really helpful for me.

tj0ipx,"Ugh you poor thing:( that sounds terrible! I work in women’s health (currently labor and delivery), and let me tell you: YEAST INFECTIONS IN PREGNANCY ARE INSANE. I’ve had so many patients struggle with UTIs and yeast infections during pregnancy. You’re more at risk for both by being pregnant! Go into the doctors ASAP and beg them for meds for your UTI and yeast infection! I’d also ask them for a daily suppressant of acyclovir. I know they’ll start you on it when you hit 36wks, but you shouldn’t have to suffer now. In the meantime you can take topical antifungals like monistat for your yeast infections! Make sure to watch out for the oral antifungal med diflucan, because that is NOT safe to take during pregnancy. Also for your UTI you can take Pyridium (azo urinary pain relief). This med is in category B for pregnancy meds ( animal studies show no harm to fetuses but there are no well-controlled studies in pregnant women). This med works so fast at relieving your bladder spasms/need to piss every 5 minutes, buuuut it won’t get rid of the actual infection. Youll have to go to the doctors ASAP for that. Don’t wait too long to go. Sometimes UTIs can spread into a kidney infection. All in all, I recommended some meds, but if you feel uncomfy at all with the thought of taking these meds, call your doctor and get a second opinion:) sending you good vibes and a healthy pregnancy:)",2022-03-21 05:21:58,1
tj0ipx,Thanks! I already treated the uti a few weeks ago luckily dr gave me antibiotics. I had some monstat on hand since I get yeast infections any time I take  certain antibiotics. I have a weeks supply of anti viral I keep on hand as well I hate the idea of being on any meds regularly for herpes since I don't typically get break outs at all so hopefully this is the last outbreak or ill have to start taking suppressants. Which of course I'll have to do weeks 36 anyway for the baby safety. Good thing I keep lots of meds on hand at home,2022-03-21 06:14:21,1

ticom2,Can I ask how you disclose and when? Those things make a big difference I found,2022-03-20 04:14:13,1
ticom2,What do you normally say when disclosing? If you don’t mind me asking. I’m new to this so I haven’t been with anyone since! I’m scared to. I love your outlook on this though ❤️,2022-03-20 08:35:52,1
ticom2,Yeah that’s pretty much what I say,2022-03-20 18:17:01,1

ticom2,Are you serious? What if they have HIV? Hepatitis? Syphilis? You have an occasional non life threatening skin pimple /rash condition you think you HAVE to disclose but your partners could have bubonic plague and you don't care? That's really weird thinking.  If someone refuses to get tested that's a HUGE red flag.,2022-03-20 19:04:15,1

When I’m on meds my lady area finally feels completely normal and I can’t wait to get that feeling back🤦🏻‍♀️",2022-03-20 14:37:52,1
ticom2,I didn’t say that at all lol. I don’t know where you live or what but if you think everyone will do that I think you have the wrong idea. Obviously if someone told me they have hiv or something like that I wouldn’t bother. Usually I get to the point where I actually trust someone before telling them. Gonna be a waste of time if you go around asking everyone to get tested before even disclosing,2022-03-20 19:17:55,2

ticom2,I'm not saying people will get tested. I can't make them. But I've already got herpes and I'm NOT going to get something else. So if I don't see a negative test I'm not sleeping with them. It's their choice.,2022-03-20 19:33:49,1

tiz58h,"43F. During my first OB (18 months ago) I didnt see any sores but it was the worst pain I have ever experience in my life. It was probably tiny and close to my urethra. Maybe inside. Couldnt get tested because the doctor didnt see anything. Was given Valtrex just in case.

2nd OB again no sores. A tiny spot of skin was very  painful. No sores and no redness but it felt like that spot was on fire. Had the swab test. It was hsv2. 

So yes it can be tiny but I dont know in your case.",2022-03-21 01:55:09,1
tiz58h,Anyone else see this as familiar? To their experience.,2022-03-21 19:30:48,1
tiz58h,"Can’t it go completely unnoticed in some ?

It’s also just weird that these show up and then go away within a couple days. But they’re always kind of red and irritated. 

I did and it came back negative. This was 9 weeks after unprotected sex. And 5 weeks after protected and unprotected oral. I’ve had lots of weird nerve feelings in my legs. Itching and burning at different times on the skin of the shaft. So I really don’t know what to think anymore",2022-03-21 00:45:40,1
tiz58h,With this being the case. I feel like most people should just not even care. And go on with their lives like there’s nothing,2022-03-21 02:17:28,1
tiz58h,Your symptoms do sound like herpes. Although I'd say it might not look like it from the pic - it looks different on everyone. And this could be herpes. Best to get it swabbed. Yes it can go away in few days tho. Weird nerve feelings?? I'd say nerve pains are very noticeably painful... . Placebo effect is real tho. Get tested and try not think or read much about it now as you'd just give yourself symptoms.,2022-03-21 01:25:18,2
tiz58h,"Yes if I can explain. The nerve feelings in my legs at times just feel like dull ache or restless leg. And then occasionally a little zap feeling below my butt on the back of my thigh. I could definitely be just noticing something that always was there. 

And honestly I’m contemplating if I will even get tested again. Not knowing definitely isn’t fun and it’s eating me up. Especially not knowing if it may be hsv1 or 2. 

But part of me thinks I should follow what the cdc says and just not test unless I know for sure. And have serious symptoms. 

I generally hyper focus too much and I’m going to try to stop giving a shit about anything anymore. Why should I care. I barely have sex anyways. So I’ll just move on and not hyper focus anymore.",2022-03-21 02:16:38,1
tiz58h,At least your nerve pains are bearable. Some people need meds for them and I don't mean antivirals. I'd rather know in case it isn't herpes and I have something else .-. But it is obs your decision. I'd personally feel terrible if I accidentally give it to someone else when I knew this could be herpes but just never tested so never disclosed 🤷‍♀️,2022-03-21 08:04:08,1
tiz58h,If I have it. At 5 weeks I was negative. So who knows. Only time will tell.,2022-03-21 14:18:17,2
tixhsz,Does anybody have any input please?,2022-03-21 18:50:48,1
tixhsz,"I’m not sure this helps, so I’ve never had an OB, anywhere so I believed.
I got tested for my former gf, (she can’t get pass it)
I tested positive for Hsv-2 and I went all in.
2 blood test at different labs, and finally the gold standard “western blot test from Washington university. I got this shit. All of these are blood test.
I’ve never had a swab test or blisters or anything on my junk or mouth… ever.
But 20tears ago I would care for my mom, who used to get these little blisters on her hands.
She always said it was a fungus so we treated it with fungus spray.
After she passed I started getting the same on my hands, I believed that it was a fungus and treated it with the same anti-fungus as I did with her.
This went on for years. Eventually I never got another OB on my fingers.
After my I tested positive I did research and read that Herpatic whitlow is HSV2 or HSV1 that has entered the body via a lesion, or cut into the hands , I can only point to that place, for my source for my infection.
After speaking to Terri Warren, she said that she would not believe that that’s my source of infection, because nobody has ever had daily testing from that source done.
But my point is a different one. From all the research I’ve done, once you have the virus in your system it only sheds or outbreak at the source of infection. So if you have it on your hands it should not travel to your Genitalia or your lips, because your body has created anti-bodys to protect those other parts of the body.
I would love to hear that I’m wrong 
I hate misinformation but nobody has been able to give me any proof otherwise.",2022-03-21 22:08:35,2
tixhsz,Thank you for the reply! I read something similar but I also read that it can spread within the first few months of getting it. It’s only been a few weeks since my potential exposure so I think I’m still in that stage where it could possibly spread.,2022-03-22 00:38:15,1

tixdxh,I've noticed that when I first got it. Btw also 20yr f. But tbh then I started using lube even if I don't feel like I need it and haven't had it happen again. Since then even without lube I'm not as irritated or swelled up there after sex. I've also talked to health professionals and they've told me it's because of the kind of sex I have 🤷‍♀️. But yeah buy some lube and over use it I'd say if this is bothering you  :),2022-03-21 08:14:52,2
tixdxh,thankyou so much! do you have any suggestions on what lube works best for you?,2022-03-21 10:27:24,1

The safer sex conversation should be a part of every encounter you have. You're fine with having it with casual sex partners, so approach this the same way. Maybe he doesn't have herpes. Maybe he has HPV. Or maybe he has something else that will impact you in a relationship, like bad credit or a criminal record or a bad relationship with his family.

tidfny,I’m guessing that’s what it is the dr didn’t really tell me which is where ! And I asked for igg levels and they told me that they don’t do that there and basically that it doesn’t matter about the levels I still have hsv1 and 2 in my blood,2022-03-21 03:30:17,1
tidfny,lmfaooo ok. well i think it’s related. my ears get clogged and muffled sometimes.,2022-03-21 04:03:16,1
ticgwt,"Yes, mine never burst. Sometimes they don’t even fully form & regress back into the skin.",2022-03-20 11:50:36,2
ticgwt,Yep. Agree with the other person.,2022-03-20 15:35:13,1
ticgwt,You’re welcome!,2022-03-20 15:36:28,1
ticgwt,"Interesting. How long does it take for yours to fade away?

I changed my approach in treating my outbreak. I did this when I first saw a TINY blister last night at 6pm. It’s now 10:30am and the swelling is down. I still see a mark (blister?). I wonder if it’s regressing back.",2022-03-20 15:32:45,1
ticgwt,"How long does it take for your blisters to fade away? What signs do you notice that show your blister won’t progress and burst? Sorry for all the questions, I know it’s different for each individual.",2022-03-20 15:41:35,1
ticgwt,Anywhere between 3 days to a week.,2022-03-20 15:34:20,1
ticgwt,Been + a little over a year. Each outbreak is different. I’m currently having one that started a week ago. Started with one blister on the left side. It was itchy & pinchy feeling in that spot. Like a needle prick. For me I can feel them coming under the skin before they surface. Like knots under my skin. There were more coming but as soon as I noticed the blister I added more antivirals to my day & used a lysine cream on them a few times a day. Everything went away within 3-4 days. Then I found a new blister on the other side a few days before the others healed. Same story going on with this one. It’s going away.,2022-03-20 15:51:20,2
ticgwt,Ok thanks!,2022-03-20 15:36:07,1
ti8bec,"Don’t be scared. Just look at the stats of how many people have it too. Get things steamy and then before you do anything that can cause an outbreak just say “I want to be transparent w you before things go further..” and simply disclose what happened and say how many other people have it as well (like 50% or more?). And also if you’ve only had one outbreak you may not experience symptoms again, which is something to share as well. But it’s all in your attitude, be nonchalant and confident about it. You got this. I’ve fortunately had all good disclosures so far where they were comfortable moving forward bc the commonality of herpes or having it already themselves. If they want to have sex w you often times herpes won’t stop them. Just have condoms on deck if they (or you) want to use protection.",2022-03-20 02:49:48,4
ti8bec,"Make sure you ask your potential partner to get a FULL PANEL std test. Then when they have their results in hand say "" oh I have hsv1 . Statistically speaking chances are 80% or so that they have hsv1 as well. Problem solved.",2022-03-20 06:20:38,3
ti8bec,"Listen, we can be rejected for anything, right? Maybe political views or religious beliefs are too different, hobbies are too different, one might be a steak lover and the other vegan, one might love animals and the other's allergic. It can happen for any reason - that's what dating is for - to find people we mesh with. 

So maybe take some time to get to know people before disclosing, and if someone violates your trust, then deny. They'll look like the ass, not you. Or you could own it. Your call. 

Taking your antivirals every once in a while - I'm not sure what that means. If you want to reduce shedding, it has to be every day. 

Remember that every single person you meet has something they would rather not have to tell the person they are newly dating. Everyone. Yours is just a virus that 67% under 50 have. :)",2022-03-20 02:58:49,2
ti8bec,"I agree, with another comment here - maybe encourage your partner to get a full panel and exchange your results. Failing that, get to know them a bit better and then disclose.

I dont agree with what the other comment on here suggests about waiting to get hot and steamy and then disclosing - that to me sounds like a bad time to disclose. Especially if they end up with having questions they want answered. For some people it could ruin the mood. But that's just me, your mileage may vary.",2022-03-20 22:51:41,2
ti8bec,"Hey! I legit just got diagnosed and am still dealing with my first outbreak, so I haven't disclosed to someone I want to have sex with right now yet, but I've told a lot of people, including people I slept with and people wanting to sleep with me.

Everyone has been really nice and talking about it has made me feel a lot better and a lot less like it's something bad or shameful. I think they key is to be matter of fact. Don't be outwardly nervous or acting like you're telling them something awful that you hope they can accept you for, cause that's not what's happening.

HSV1 is incredibly common. Your potential partner is more likely to have it than not and will certainly have been with others that had it whether they knew it or not. The only difference is that you're being open and communicating about it which is a good thing vs an embarrassing one. It's a sign of a partner who you can probably have great sex with since they are open and responsible.

GHSV1 is very unlikely to be transmittable even on days where you are shedding, which is apparently as low as 4 days a year. 

Just be mindful of if you are having an outbreak. If you want to be extra careful, my doctor said taking antivirals at least from 10 days before sex is best.

You might want to encourage them to get tested for HSV1 and HSV2 themselves. This is a two way street.",2022-03-20 01:09:28,1
ti8bec,"Forgot to mention that people I've talked to re sexual partners I all met only once. A couple I hadn't slept with yet but had planned to. I didn't know them long, so I don't think connection needs to be super deep. I do imagine though that if it's one of the first things someone learns about you, they will potentially judge you and dip. I figure my plan will be to meet someone in person at least once and then tell them, even potentially during the first meeting just later on. 

I think in the situation you're in, that most reasonable people would be fine with it.",2022-03-20 01:54:11,2
ti8tus,"Hiiiii take a deep breath! This is only herpes. It's bumps on your skin. I don't mean to diminish your concerns because I've been there myself, but I promise you'll be okay.

Get yourself on antivirals if you want. I take them daily. 

My dating and sex life have not changed much since having the herp! If anything, it's made me more communicative and pickier about who I sleep with. I don't get outbreaks. I've disclosed to probably.....30 people or so and only 2 have ever cared. 

This feels shocking right now but it won't always be that way.",2022-03-20 03:44:56,2
ti8tus,"I’m older but I think we all felt this way. Cut yourself some slack & let yourself go through the process of processing your emotions. 

I bought a bottle of cheap-ass wine at cvs when I was waiting for my first bottle of valtrex to be filled. You aren’t alone. We are everywhere. I was embarrassed to pick up my antiviral at the pharmacy & the pharmacy tech said, oh we run out of valtrex sooooo frequently. Everyone here is on it). 

Don’t hate yourself. We are everywhere",2022-03-20 04:10:26,1
ti8tus,"Hey hun. Take a moment to appreciate all the wonderful and beautiful things about you. Those are what matter. Herpes does not make someone ugly or untouchable. You are the same woman as before.. you just got a little something to deal with. And by little, I mean little. 
(From here on I’m calling it HSV because that’s what I prefer)

HSV is not this all the time outbreak you have to face. At the most it will pop up from on occasion and at the least it will only pop up a couple times in your life. It’s easy to live like it’s not even there. When you do have outbreaks... sure it’s uncomfortable and can make you sad. BUT you get through it. Life doesn’t stop because of some bumps. 

I’m 23, pregnant and happily with my boyfriend. We found out we had HSV-2 at the same time and decided it didn’t matter much. It’s taken me a couple years to really accept it but even back then I stayed optimistic and learned as much as I could about the virus and my body. It felt scary at first. But you will find that most people won’t ever know or need to know. And anyone you choose to tell will show you if they’re someone you want in life based on their reaction to you. You don’t want a man, friend or whatever that doesn’t accept and understand something trivial. And when you break it down HSV 1 or 2 are both silly little pains. We are part of nature and not immune to things like this. That’s okay. It’s just life. You 100% will go on to find so much love and enjoyment in life.



Here’s some facts that help me feel unbothered and secure in myself as a woman with HSV-2! 

- HSV-2 does not transmit to the mouth as easily as HSV-1 transmits to the genitals. 
- Unless you are having a time of viral shedding (causing high viral load) your chances of infecting someone else are very low.
- there are couples with one positive person and one negative and they don’t transmit.
- there are meds that help protect your partner from getting it. You take the anti-viral and it helps keep your viral load way down.
- condoms are a thing 
- HSV does not hurt your reproductive system.
- there are many options for how to manage it. 
- TONS of people have type 1, 2 or both. 
- other STIs should be taken more seriously than HSV. HSV gets a bad rep. HSV is not life threatening. But you know what can be? Chlamydia and gonorrhea! Yup those can kill you if left untreated. HSV cannot. It’s just a little irritating thing that happens sometimes.


Hope some of this helps! 

Remember you are more than your sex. But also your sex and love life is not over. It’s just different... which no matter what life will throw things at us to challenge our relationships with others and ourselves. Be confident! Knowledge is power

Sorry for the novel",2022-03-20 06:33:49,1
tidj6p,Not until they have been tested as well and you know their status. THEN you have the talk not before.,2022-03-20 06:22:09,1
tidj6p,Agreed. No more one sided disclosers. Full transparency or find someone else to fuccckkkk IDC,2022-03-20 06:44:14,2
tidj6p,Soooo turns out I told him and he has it too,2022-03-22 10:29:58,1
ti86gw,Been in the same situation and it made me feel better once I said something to the person. Your guilt is going to eat you up if you stay quiet… just explain your situation and tell her that the next day you felt symptoms. Or just wait and see how it goes for a couple of days if she’s fine after a week and things keep going to the right direction still let her know your status,2022-03-20 01:33:10,1
ti86gw,And no it’s not a for sure thing she got it.. my bf gets them all the time and I’m fine,2022-03-20 01:33:48,1
ti86gw,"I can't lie and say I don't regret getting with the person that gave it to me but a lot of that is because I didn't even like them/feel attracted to them. I just felt like I needed to stop being prudish. After them I was with people I was more attracted to that I had better sex with using protection.

If I had liked the person and the experience, and was explained the situation as you did, I would understand and I wouldn't be that upset.

With ohsv1 being so common and you having had it so young, I understand why you didn't think about it. I always assumed I had it and never thought twice about it, the same goes for a lot of people. Turns out I didn't have it as a kid like I thought and contracted it now so I had nothing to disclose till recently, but I thought I did, I just never thought it mattered. It didn't even occur to me

Having my first outbreak and being diagnosed recently as an adult was a wake-up call for me that actually this is something I should be talking to people about.

Don't beat yourself up too much. Talk to her honestly and try to be more open in the future.",2022-03-20 06:08:02,1
ti86gw,"Unlikely tbh. You should tell her though. 

You can ease her in with calling it a cold sore since I assume y’all won’t get sexual that quickly. There’s a good chance she gets cold sores too. 

If she doesn’t, warn her. If she gets infected, it’ll take a few months before she has enough antibodies to protect other regions from being infected.",2022-03-20 06:43:41,1
ti86gw,Thank you for the comments I really appreciate taking the time the answer my questions,2022-03-20 02:35:08,2
