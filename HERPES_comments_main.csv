Herpes is basically the best thing that ever happened to me (not joking),"1st 2 months I thought my life was over. I hid under a comforter with no AC in the middle of a Phoenix summer. I was depressed af. I was a stripper and identified with my sexual side to a probably unhealthy degree. 

6 months after contacting it I wanted to hook up with this guy because I knew he had herpes. I ended up dating him. I ended up loving him. I ended up having a daughter with him. 

She is why I live through my worst depressions, why I quit smoking, why I live and breathe.

Do I always need to disclose my HSV-1?,"I recently slept with someone I was casually dating and before we did anything physical we both agreed to get STD tested, including HSV 1 and 2. I have never been tested for HSV before and have never had an outbreak, but my test did come back positive. I'm not surprised as it's so common for sexually active adults. I told the guy I was seeing and he was fine with it as we agreed to use condoms anyway.

Now that I have this positive result though, am I required to disclose to every sexual partner moving forward? I always use condoms if I'm not exclusive with someone, but I really just want to do the right thing here.",ts5qxh,4,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/ts5qxh/do_i_always_need_to_disclose_my_hsv1/,2022-03-30 08:52:04-04:00

I want to help my girlfriend after giving her herpes but I’m unsure how,"Almost a year ago right before our 4 year anniversary my girlfriend and I we’re having sex problems (her libido and mine weren’t matching up because her birth control). I pushed her discomfort little bit too far one day by letting me go down on her which she never really enjoyed and she tried to partake but had to stop. To make matters better about a week later on our anniversary she had a MASSIVE extremely painful outbreak. Turns out me having cold sores as a child could transmit oral herpes. I had no clue and I feel insanely bad about it. Now she’s haunted about our anniversary time and oral sex. (She’s in therapy for unrelated reasons but has talked about it with her therapist). She will go down on me but absolutely resents getting head and even after a year with me asking periodically she’s not interested. She recently came to me upset saying I felt so guilty I never addressed the issue and ignored the fact I gave her this skin disease that causes her to suffer monthly and that me not acknowledging that and not helping her hasn’t made her more inclined to get head. She’s right and honestly I feel shitty in so many aspects. I just want to help her. I’m a year late and I have no idea what to do. But I plan on marrying her and I really genuinely want to find a way to fix this. Obviously and unfortunately I can back what I gave her, did, or didn’t do. But if anyone has any advice on what I can do I’m all ears. I just want her to feel better. 

I also want to add that she’s been a great partner to me. She doesn’t hold what happened against me and has worked hard to catch up with me sexually. We genuinely love each other.

Edited to add: I am her first partner and was the one who took her virginity and all first. I’m not sure how important that is but maybe it is",ts52d6,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/ts52d6/i_want_to_help_my_girlfriend_after_giving_her/,2022-03-30 08:13:52-04:00
Can test results with no outbreak tell you if it’s oral or genital?,"If you get tested for herpes and the results say you have either hsv1 or hsv2… can the tests also tell you if you have it orally or genitally? Or is the only way to know is if you have a current outbreak?

My results show I have ghsv1, but I had an outbreak when I got tested. They also swabbed my mouth but didn’t say anything about oral hsv1. But I’ve also never had any signs of oral hsv1… does this mean I could also have oral hsv1 and not know it cause there was never outbreak to test for it?

"Confused about test results. Was told negative on phone, but then told positive. pic in post.","https://imgur.com/a/gNxRgwX - Results (see picture for proof might take it down later for privacy):

HSV 1 and or 2 Abs, Igm by elisa 0.81

HSV type 1/2 Combined Ab, IgG 4.79

HSV 1 Glycoproteins G ab, IgG 0.15

HSV 1 Glycoproteins G antibody, IgG 0.13

i'll posted on askdocs if you want more details.  I didn't have visible sores but was sick with the flu-like symptoms and was negative for covid, strep, flu and on day 4 Urgent care said they saw blisters in my throat so wanted to swab for HSV and do blood test amongst other things.  The swab was negative.  Had to wait until yesterday to get blood results and over the phone they told me Negative, no antibodies.  I got a copy for my records and it has this combined test positive.  When i called back they seemed super uniformed and said I DID have antibodies.  just trying to understand they were pretty aggressive and just told me to go to PCP.  I requested the doctor who requested the tests to give me a call back since she seemed knowledgable, but that could be a few days.

So wtf is going on? 1 person on Ask docs said that i don't have it and the Combined IgM and IgG are kind of first pass, and since I got a positive on combined IgG that triggered the individual glycoproteins. So since those were negative, thus I am negative.  I've seen posts that IgM and Combined are not accurate.    I found this [link] (https://ltd.aruplab.com/Tests/Pub/0050916) to the testing site to the test which seems to confirm that.  they even say it IgM is inaccurate (nothing about combined) and to refer to individual glycoproteins.  

I can get behind this combined test flagging for incorrectly for something other than herpes, and then the more accurate IgG individually.  the notes on the results seem to support that ""ARUP test code 0050292 and 0050294 will be added additional charges may apply”. so like that positive triggered the individuals and then those were negative. so thus i have IgM  negative and then individual HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG negative. 

So i don't have any HSV antibodies and don't have any recent IgM antibodies building up so all good, negative for HSV, and can move on?",ts8wyb,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/ts8wyb/confused_about_test_results_was_told_negative_on/,2022-03-30 11:24:41-04:00

Lost,"I’m F17, and was diagnosed with HSV2 about 2 months ago. I wasn’t even supposed to find out. My boyfriend had a scratchy throat and the doctor said it could’ve been HSV or tonsillitis, and my bf said no way it was HSV so they went with tonsillitis. We were recently broken up for a while, in which I saw some other people. He asked me to get tested, which I did, but didn’t realize originally that HSV wasn’t on the STI panel. I went again and requested for HSV as well. It came back positive for HSV2 but not 1. I have never even had an outbreak, and I can’t help but think, if my bf never had a scratchy throat, I would have kept living my life. 

My boyfriend and I are still together, but nowhere will test him. He’s very laid back about it, says that he either has it or doesn’t, and we still have sex with no condom. 

I’m so young and I’m scared about what this means. I don’t want to stay with my boyfriend just because he accepts me already and it’s easy. Will I have to disclose everytime I kiss someone? Or only when we have sex? What do I even say? I don’t understand how I could have HSV2 and never have had an outbreak. 

My doctor told me that I’m not contagious because of my igH? the way he explained it was basically that I only tested positive for the antibodies. my igG level was 1.68, what does this mean? Could it be a false positive? I’ve read about a Western blot, could I do that?

Has anyone gotten the western blot in New York City?,"I live in NYC and I'm interested in getting the western blot test. I tested low positive 3 times (august, september, and january) with scores in the 1.2-1.3 range and I've never had any sores.

I've been igg tested 3-4 times previous to this over the course of 6-7 years which all came back negative.

My doctor seemed confused at me asking to have this done and didn't sound very open to it. He has a very small office without much equipment - he generally sends me off somewhere else for anything beyond basic blood/urine samples).

How did you handle passing HSV to someone and you didn’t know you had it?,"This wasn’t the case for me, but the person who gifted me this, had no idea they were a carrier. I’m just curious to see how you handled it, if you were in their same situation. The reason why I’m asking is because I want to get an insight of how he may be feeling. We haven’t communicated much since I told him about my results. He got tested and found out he did have it and from comparing previous sex partners with when we last got tested, he most definitely was the one who I contracted this from. 

I handled it really well and I haven’t ripped him a new one. He just keep telling me that he doesn’t blame me if I hate him forever. I reassured him that wasn’t the case, but I just find it odd that after all this he completely ghosted me. It was weird because we had a nice thing going on prior to this.

Does this look like an internal outbreak?,"I’ve had enough of everything because I have had zero clarity this past year but symptoms keep persisting. I had an encounter last March where the person gave me unprotected oral and protected sex which started all these symptoms such as anus sores that would come and go in a day. I kept testing negative on the IGg tests for HSV 1 and 2 up until one last week which would’ve been over a year post-exposure with this guy. All tests negative. 

This weekend, I had a stressful time and barely got any sleep, had heaps of pizza and sugary drinks and was fingered by someone and the next day, I felt some watery discharge (I am ovulating so could be related) but I’m feeling these nerve shooting sensations in the anus and vagina region and it feels a bit hot inside. I have nerve pain and I did sleep funny on my back. There are no external sores but I take a pic and see these when I pull the opening.

Do these look like anyone’s internal outbreaks? There are more images if you click the link. What do I do when my tests have been consistently negative for a year? I cannot afford the WB nor is it feasible for me where I live and every time I can get a swab booked in, they disappear. 

I would appreciate your help so much. I have been trying to let this go but when I keep getting these symptoms, I cannot function anymore or let this go until I get some relief.

"Long distance relationship, disclose now or later?","I'm 36 and I've had HSV2 since I was 19, I'm now largely asymptomatic (maybe a flare up once every 2 years).

Over the last year I've built a relationship with a girl from work and whilst it's mainly been friendly it's become more intimate in the last few months. I've tried (ish) to distance myself from discussing anything sexual but it's become impossible and the flirting is getting a bit steamy.

She's in Canada and I'm based in the UK, but my company is moving me over to her town in 4 weeks (for 6 months) to expand the business and train new employees.

I consulted with my friends a while ago on this and they unanimously recommended I wait until we meet in person. I did agree with this at the time but as the relationship has escalated in the last month I'm starting to have real anxiety and don't want to seen as deceiving her or leading her on.

My previous disclosures came early in relationships but were in my early to mid 20s. This feels like a completely different beast to tackle, plus it's been a while.

my crush told me he has herpes… after we hooked up,"I’ve had a crush on my neighbor since I moved in. We hooked up 2 weeks ago, and I ended up going to his house several nights in a row, so we had a good amount of unprotected sex. He went on vacation and when he got back he took me out on a date.

As we were driving there he told me something had been weighing on him. That he has herpes and should have told me sooner but he hasn’t had an outbreak in so long. He told me not to worry because his outbreak didnt start until days after we had last had sex. I told him it was ok and kept the conversation brie and pleasant even tho I was freaked out 

I knew that there was still a chance that I could have it because I’ve done research before and know it can spread without an outbreak.

Now I’m starting what seems like an outbreak. It hurts, I took a picture and saw bumps around my vagina, but not in it (almost like bad razor burn) I’m having a lot of watery discharge so much that I need to wear a pad or it feels like I peed myself. I had a fever last night. I just feel so sad. Like I’m doomed to be celibate even though I know that is dramatic and untrue.

I really really like him. I don’t want to blame him because it was my choice to have unprotected sex. Anyone could have given it to me. I was recently tested for all stds however so I know I was clean before hooking up with him. I just wish he had been honest at first. I would have accepted it and used protection and if I eventually got it from him then I would be ok. 

I know I’m going to be ok I just feel so low right now. Things were going so good between us and he truly thinks he didnt give it to me and I’ve been avoiding him a bit, mostly bc I feel like shit but I also don’t want to tell him bc I don’t want him to feel worse about it.

Even worse is that I hooked up with an old fwb while he was on vacation. We are in the same friend group and he has recognized that something is weighing on me, that I’m sad and not myself. Do I put myself through telling him even tho he may not have gotten it from me?

Clarity Needed,"Recently I've been on a bit of a sexual escapade, meeting people on Grindr, not all of them leading to sex (oral or anal) but definitely mouth-to-mouth contact. After my most recent conquest, I had a sore throat and a headache that lasted for a couple of days. At first, I thought that it was just the weather or pollen (which is very high in my area), but then I noticed my nose getting red and forming bumps when my headache and sore throat went away. Initially, I thought they were just oily bumps and didn't think much of it but they hurt and look different than what I normally get. They're small, yellowish bumps in a cluster around the tip of my nose and hurt when I touch them, almost like a burning sensation. They look more like blisters than an oil-clogged pore. There was also one above my lip too that I picked at (whoops). Something just doesn't seem or feel right, and after my spree of strangers, it makes me wonder if I have herpes or not. I'm getting tested tomorrow so hopefully, I will have official clarity within the next couple of days. Of course, all of this is happening days before my first date which I haven't had in over a year and I am not sure what to do. I want to be precautious of course and want to ensure that I will not put him at any kind of risk, but in the meantime, I don't know what to do; nor how to cope if herpes is the case.

Do I have to disclose if my Ex never got it from me after sex?,"I have HSV2 (genital, not on my penis but like the pubic mound area bc thankfully I did wear a condom that time) in **March 2020**. I had the initial outbreak for a month. Got tested and confirmed HSV2.  


Then a much milder outbreak a few months later in **July 2020**. Then I never had another out break even til this day. Thankfully.  


Then about a year later in **June 2021** I got back with my ex, disclosed my condition, and she accepted me. We had sex for a year straight, no condom, and she never got anything. No herpes transmission. I even get cold sores and she never got that (because I made sure to *never* kiss her with a cold sore and wait a week until it went away.)  


We broke up recently :C and I want to get back in the dating game. I'm getting TONS of date but I'm veryyy slow to make the move to sex bc of the HSV2 and I'm afraid to disclose bc I know it'll turn off 90% of my dates lol.  


So my question is , if I had sex without a condom for a year straight with my ex while I technically had HSV2 and she never got it...do I really need to disclose this to new sexual partners?  


If she didn't get it, I don't think these other people will either. Especially if there are no visible signs of an outbreak (that was my gauge for when my ex and I would have sex. And at some point we just never thought about it again and would have sex. Of course if there was a red bump/sore or something I wouldn't have!)

Questions about Western Blot,"I see that when it comes to the IgG test it’s recommended to wait 12 weeks after possible exposure for most accurate results but I was wondering if that same timeline applies to the Western Blot? 

I took my first IgG test yesterday even though It’s only been a little over 2 weeks since the possible exposure but I did so with the intention of following up again at a later date at 12 weeks out. I see so many posts about the “low positives” on the IgG that turn out to be negative on the Western Blot that I’ve already got my mind wondering if I should just do that at 12 weeks or sooner if that’s possible? 

Is there a comprehensive post or link in regards to the western blot I can find here? It would also be helpful to be able to share with my doctor.",trju7c,1,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/trju7c/questions_about_western_blot/,2022-03-29 16:47:51-04:00
False negative results after negative blood and PCR?,"Sex with girl who didn’t know she had herpes (asymptomatic)- she got tested after and let me know she was positive. 

I have small red blisters that keep appearing randomly. I assumed it was herpes. IGG blood test at 12 weeks was negative. Recently got a blister swabbed PCR (5 days after it appeared) and it was negative as well. Although, I also have really painful lymph nodes in my groin. One seems infected because some pus is coming out when squeezed. I know swollen lymph nodes is a sign of herpes. 

What are the chances my blood test after 12 weeks and PCR test were both false negatives? I may have taken too long after blister formation to get it swabbed/ not enough time for type specific antibodies to form?

Not sure if it’s HSV or something else?,"Hi everyone,

I am a female who is sexually active with a single parter, been tested for everything in between partners. 
I recently got a few small itchy bumps on my inner thigh (2 mid way down my thigh and 3 in a triangle on the crease of my leg). I have had a herpes scare before but it ended up being a Staph Infection. Now, the bumps are different and it’s more than one. They itch sometimes but not often, mostly at night. They started as tiny red bumps and are still, no sign of blisters that I can tell. It’s been about 4 days and from my knowledge of herpes, they would start blistering today or in a couple more days. 
I have no flu symptoms or anything, I have had chronic yeast infections so I have had abnormal discharge, but nothing that I haven’t had the past 6 months (is being addressed). 

I got a full panel std test (including hsv) yesterday because I got worried. My partner says he’s clean and has tested before he was with me but I am not sure if he is being faithful or not. I don’t want to say anything because it very well could be some weird spider bite (I got a couple on my leg and foot that were similar a few days ago but these bumps are lasting longer). 

I asked my doctor and since I have been concerned about it before, they just told me to do the std test and didn’t want to see me. I’m going to a minute clinic tomorrow just to see their opinion (it’s like urgent care but at cvs). 

I have no idea what to do and all the pictures of herpes online and on here don’t line up with mine. Would really love some guidance. I’ve been taking pictures of them everyday and they haven’t changed much. 

Please let me know what you think, I’m so stressed waiting for my blood results because I know I won’t have those for a week or so.

Does this look like herpes? Long term itching,"Posted a couple days ago but things have slightly worsened since from what i can see. Essentially, i had protected sex with a woman (Im a male) last year in August. No kissing. But she gave me head without a condom on. I dont have any herpes symptoms at all (Fever, pain, cold sores) - and my penis has been completely fine since. Nothing indicating anything off.

Since October, i started to develop an itch on my bum. It’s basically been consistently itching since. Mostly bad at night time but if i take a poop the itching flares up sometimes. I have no other symptoms. No pain. Nothing of the sort. Just a consistent itch since then. It’s itched every night since October to now, and yes i know im a little crazy for not going to see a doctor already. So please save that haha. Just a little stumped. I do plan to try a hydrocortisone and if that does nothing i will bite the bullet. Howver i thought id post here first to check. I had someone tell me it looks like hemmeroids (the little swollen part directly on my anus) but the red patches look odd and thats where the primary itching comes from. There’s no liquid in them, they just bleed if i scratch them.

The redness and itch also extends up my entire buttcrack, with another one of those red patches at the very top.

Why herpes is tricky.,"This is a tricky virus because it’s the only virus that somehow gets into our nerve receptors. The immune system has no filtering of that bodily system. 

The virus also has several tricks to hide and cloak itself even when it is living dormant in a cell membrane. 

The virus’s favorite receptor it used to originally infect us is by attacking our Heparan sulfate (HS) which is a linear polysaccharide found in all animal tissues. Which are basically the carbohydrate molecules on our skin. 

After that it’s in and there is a lot of enigma on how it then fuses and also how it gets into our nervous system and able to constantly re infect us over & over.


So far gene therapy/editing seems like the only route that might stand a chance on getting the virus out of our nervous system and trials are being done on animals. 

Education is needed like this because I was once suicidal but when you start looking at it from a logical technical analysis you just start to realize it’s a whole another world going on at the microscopic level. Viruses aren’t by definition alive, like bacteria but it’s quite amazing how these things move and protect themselves and procreate and replicate. 

You don’t have “herpes”. You are a subject to a molecular assassin who has broke through your bodies defense cell membrane and attacked your central nervous system and we just don’t have the technology yet to reach him.",tqg0sx,42,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tqg0sx/why_herpes_is_tricky/,2022-03-28 14:35:09-04:00

I read a lot that ghsv1 has a bad primary outbreak within 2-10 days of exposure and ghsv2 goes unnoticed for a while, but could ghsv1 still be a possibility in this case?

Does this look like herpes to you? No idea what it is,"I had protected sex last August, but got a blowjob. No kissing or anything. But that was it. Since around October last year, ive had a consistent itch on my rectum. Maybe between now and then, ive had a single week where it didnt itch or was barely noticeable.

It’s only really bad at night. I dont feel the urge to itch during the day at all, hence why i’ve gone for so long without seeking help. Also after a poop it tends to get a little itchy as well. The dark red spots ive itched and caused them to bleed before slightly, but that mightve also been from itching too hard at night. I have no other symptoms. No pain or discomfort, apart from the itching of course. Also as far as i know the herpes ‘sores’ have liquid in them. The red spots i have just bleed when i scratch them and then slightly disappear.

Decided to throw a camera down there and take some photos and it looks a little weird. Looks just like a traditional rash but the couple darker red spots have me concerned. Thanks guys.

[UPDATE] Was told by two medical professionals I likely had Herpes. After being tested it turned out to be Syphilis. Get tested.,"Just wanted to put up an update to a post I made over the weekend. 

For context, in mid-February I had a sore or two on my penis and based on my symptoms I had assumed I had herpes and was going to let the first OB heal while I was traveling for work before going to a doctor. When it never fully healed and I started to get *new* symptoms (Balanitis) in mid-March I went to an Urgent Care. 

The professional at the Urgent Care spent 5-10 minutes talking to me and said I'd be better off going to a health clinic that does more comprehensive STI testing. However, they said that I very likely had herpes and I'd probably only be going to confirm it. 

I scheduled an appointment at a clinic (Planned Parenthood) two days later. I did comprehensive STI testing (blood, urine, swabbing) and talked with a doctor there. They also said I most likely had herpes, but a couple of things I said made them think there's a chance it might be Syphilis instead. 

Over the weekend I got even more symptoms (non-itchy rash on my trunk, general fatigue). The results came back today and they said I was only positive for Syphilis (Stage II). Luckily it's treatable with an injection of penicillin in the hip/buttocks. If I had gotten tested sooner, I would have only needed to take some pills for it. 

General takeaway is don't just assume, make sure you get tested. If I had kept assuming that I had something that I didn't and had gone without treatment, this could have turned into a more damaging and potentially deadly problem.

Disclosure,"I (F22) have ghsv-1. I was diagnosed early feb 22, and have only had the 1 initial OB. 
To be honest, i dont feel different/gross or upset that I have it like at all… im wel educated on HSV1&2 and i know genital type 1 is the least “contagious” out of all the herpe strains. That being said, i dont feel the need to disclose to my sexual partners at all (im ready for the controversial debate in the comments). 2 drs even told me theres no need to disclose for casual hookups. 
My reasoning is because oral HSV1 is so incredibly common, yet no one with cold sores ever discloses before they kiss someone. At most i will tell my sex partners i have hsv1 which most commonly causes cold sores. If they choose to accept the risk to sleep with me knowing i have hsv1, without disclosing the location then I feel like that’s perfectly adequate. They are accepting the risk of catching oral HSV1 which is the most contagious of all herpes, if they accept that risk then i feel like ive done the right thing.

Day Old Diagnosis,"So today is my first full day after my diagnosis, got my results emailed back to me yesterday. In all reality I’ve likely had it much longer without knowing. 

I had been seeing a guy off and on for about a year. Turns out he had been cheating the entire time with multiple women. One of them found my Instagram and contacted me, and through talking to her found out she had herpes and they had unprotected sex AFTER she told him. Looking at the timing realizing he most certainly had unprotected sex with me after this date. 

When I found that out I scheduled an appointment at my gyno who actually sort of dissuaded me from getting the test as I hadn’t had an actual outbreak saying “oh you would know, and we would swab the outbreak anyway”. So I felt relieved and went on my merry way. 

I have slept with this man since then (a questionable decision, but a discussion for another time or subreddit). He showed me a screenshot of his test with HSV negative. Now I believe he either doctored it, or he was tested too soon after exposure and got a false negative. I believe this because he is the only person I have slept with during that entire time period and since, and I have since had two small outbreaks. There’s a possibility I’ve had it for years, but with the timing of the outbreaks I believe it is from him. 

Anyway I had an outbreak this week after sex with him and I decided to go get a blood test. Results came back yesterday as abnormal. 

We had gotten in an argument about something else that resulted in him leaving my house. But I texted him my results, he read the message and all those after, and has said nothing. 

I’ve been bouncing between devastated and somewhat alright. Devastated mostly at the situation itself. And alright in reading some posts here and seeing that people live pretty normal lives with HSV2. 

I have no interest in being intimate with anyone new anytime soon as I will have to process my involvement with him and heal, which I think will take a very long time. But maybe this is a blessing in disguise, to help me see who values me as a person regardless of my health concerns.

Has anybody ever had bad side effects from taking aciclovir?,"So I’ve had hsv2 for a few years now. I get a couple mild outbreaks every now and then but nothing major. It’s been pretty easy to handle for the most part.

2 weeks ago, however, I had an outbreak that was worse than usual. I was in the uk (I live in Spain usually) so bought some aciclovir from a pharmacy there.

Within the next few days I started to feel really bad. My vision was blurry, I was super fatigued, thirstier than usual and pissing like a racehorse. I also had diarrhoea, headaches and tingling in my arms and legs. 

It seems like lots of these can be aciclovir side-effects, but they’re rare. At first I was convinced I’d developed diabetes, but thankfully a visit to the doctors for a blood test reassured me that wasn’t the case.

So. Has anybody ever had side-effects like this from aciclovir? I have taken it before with no qualms.

Symptom timeline question,"GHSV2 Exposure 11 days ago. Shaved that morning, I used a condom, partner on antivirals with no outbreak.

Morning after “symptoms”, headache probably from lack of sleep. ED just for the day from anxiety. And noticeable razor burn from shaving the day before which left what looked to be a spot that grew into a bump which is harder than what I’ve read herpetic lesions are and skin colored not clear with fluid or puss. Urinary urgency. I know the day after more than likely has nothing to do with anything other than Anxiety since it’s too soon.

4 days after exposure noticed urinary urgency continued. No “flu symptoms” just slight cold symptoms became noticeable, sore throat, sinus congestion, respiratory congestion. Also noticed scrotum was dry and flakey. Noticeable skin flakiness if scratched but not itchy. My thoughts were eczema or contact dermatitis since I started using a new body wash. This also left inflamed fordyce spots and raw skin in some places the dry skin came off. There was one inflamed fordyce spot that had dry skin where I rubbed it off and maybe clear liquid came out, but from what I’ve read contact dermatitis can cause this (picture of this spot added at bottom of Imgur). This flakiness has continued since.

6 days after exposure constipation started. A laxative alleviated and fixed urinary urgency. Constipation continued since just not nearly as bad to the point it’s causing bladder discomfort.

10 days after exposure I noticed a tingle or static feeling in calves. As well as slight leg weakness. The tingle and leg weakness have lasted maybe 12 hours where they were noticeable and have gone down to not really noticeable unless I pay attention to it.

Anti virals before swap?,"Yesterday I was what I’ll call “soft diagnosed” with herpes. I’ve had symptoms (painful urination and general vagina soreness) for a week and went through a run around getting diagnosed with a UTI, then jk it’s just BV, to eventually herpes + BV. 

I found a small ulcer next to my clit late Saturday night and went to another urgent care Sunday. She took a look and told me she thought it was herpes, ordered a blood test to be sure (awaiting results). Their swabs were expired so she couldn’t swab the sore. She prescribed me valacy. 

After reading about the accuracy of a blood test I decided to schedule an appt with the minute clinic today to get a swab done. At this point I’ve accepted that it’s more than likely herpes but I’d like to at least know which kind it is. Should I still start the antivirals or wait until the swab is done? 

Tldr: will antivirals interfere with a swab test if started 4 hours before swab test?",tqch4f,2,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tqch4f/anti_virals_before_swap/,2022-03-28 11:57:00-04:00

Can I use abreva for ghsv1,"I know there is a lot of posts about the emotional repercussions of herpes and just wanted to briefly interrupt with a technical issue.

Once in awhile I'll get a single sore on my outer-outer labia (like closer to my thigh), and it was confirmed awhile ago to be hsv1. I know the bottle says it can't be used for genital herpes, but it also says it's for hsv1 so... unofficially what can happen

Boyfriend tested positive 3 months ago and now tests negative I have some questions,"My boyfriend has these red spots on his penis that seem to never go away. About two months before we met he went to a dermatologist about these “penile lesions” the doctor said “it doesn’t look like anything” and sent him home with a script for a topical cream used for jock itch. 

We have been together for just over 6 months and have been having unprotected sex the whole time. He was tested for stds prior to us meeting but not herpes. 
So I told him to order an online test. 

We went with the iDNA site and bought their most comprehensive test bc it also included ureaplasma mycoplasma which weren’t included on many tests, it was 300 bucks. This test did not include hsv type 1. It was a blood drops on a card style test and urine. When he finally got the results back it came back negative for everything except for HSV2. They did not provide a range number. So I start researching everything I possibly can about herpes. 

Big thank you to this sub by the way I’ve been visiting here for the last 12 weeks almost daily reading everyone’s different experiences. 

At 9 weeks from the last time we had sex I bought a hsv2 test from stdcheck and went to the lab and had my blood drawn. Got my results next day and it was negative. I have not had any symptoms. 

At 12 weeks I got another test this time I went with the 10 panel test bc it wasn’t much more expensive than the hsv type 1 and 2 test. Went to the lab had blood drawn and received results two days later. Negative for everything. 

My boyfriend also finally retested with stdcheck/quest labs at 12 weeks. Tested for type 1 and 2. I thought maybe he tested positive in the first place bc he could have type 1. He received his results three days later and turns out they are both negative. 

So now for my questions;
Should we now assume we are both negative?
Should he retest again to be safe?
Also I’m wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience with false positives with the iDNA (I do need answers) website? 
Or maybe false positives with any blood drops on card style test? 
Are these at home tests for herpes just totally unreliable? Even more so than the already questionable accuracy for herpes tests in general? 

Thank you for reading. Thanks in advance for any replies. And I hope everyone has a wonderful day and life!!!

How ever the fuck I caught this thing, I learned that maybe there’s some good in having this virus. I discovered hobbies, learned how to maintain a more healthy lifestyle (healthy diet and exercising 6days a week). For whatever reason, my dating life turned for the better. I realized who just saw me as a piece of ass and who legit wanted to get to know me and gave a shit about me after disclosing. I’ve grown to be okay with having herpes and developed new ways to cope and come to peace with everything. I know it’s completely different for a lot of other people, but what sense does it make crying about this virus. What’s done is done; the only thing we can do is look forward to the vaccine and cure that’s in progress. 🥰🥰🥰 Below are links to an article of the vaccine in process and a pic of the research.

Protected Sex w/ non disclosure,"

I (30m) recently went on a first date and it was terrific! We connected well and she (29f) is someone I would pursue for a long term relationship. And I’m getting the same vibes from her post date.

We ended up having protected sex (w/ condom) that night. I take my antiviral medication like a daily vitamin and never have OBs when I do.

I didn’t disclose and now I need to.. very nervous. Any similar stories with success? Is it that bad not to disclose before protected sex with anti virals? Any transmission fact sheets I can use if she asks for information?

Edit:

Don’t do what I did. It’s best to disclose before sex. Woman in question didn’t take it well. Think how you contracted HSV and what a difference it would have been if you had an appropriate sexual health talk before sex. 

I’d rather deal with the rejection before sex than the way I feel now which is disgusted with myself.",tq9vvr,1,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tq9vvr/protected_sex_w_non_disclosure/,2022-03-28 09:57:17-04:00

Should I do the blood test?,"Back at the end of November I had sex with a new partner, a person I’ve known for years. I’m female he’s male. First time was strictly oral, and after a few days I remember feeling kinda itchy and like he threw off things down there but nothing bad. 

Couple weeks later we have full intercourse unprotected but it lasts maybe 2 minutes (he couldn’t keep it up lol)

Few days after this I’m super itchy, mostly noticing at night. I found myself waking up scratching the same spot but whenever I looked it didn’t notice much, just redness and some white spots. I decide to pray it ends soon and do nothing (smart I know) but it goes on for a while. I look again and see a fissure between my inner and outer labia which is where I had been scratching. It was very long and white, no pain. This makes me decide to try yeast infection treatment along with steroid cream. Same time the fissure is there I’m a little tender at the opposite side of my vulva when I press on it but other than that I never had any severe pain, blistering, I could pee just fine. 

I take the one day canesten pill and use the anti fungal  cream and steroid cream and things start to feel way better and the fissure is gone within two days. After a few days I stop the applications and go on my merry way feeling much better 

Then about a week or so later (January now..) I’m itchy and irritated down there again so I go back to the cream and it seems to get better.  Never get another fissure or anything. Repeat this until today where I continue to get these bouts of itchy and irritation. 

I have anxiety and googled the fissure and got worried I had contracted genital herpes. I’ve had a cold sore in the past so I know if I test I’d have that. I’ve mentioned this to my family doctor and he didn’t seem worried and because I had no issues at the time said to bring it up at my next PAP which he has referred me out for because they don’t do them. It’s taking forever for them to get back to me.

Getting into single life with HSV-1,"I am 23m and just got out of a 4 year relationship this week, and tested positive for HSV-1 about a year ago.

When I was diagnosed my doctor dropped it on me and didn’t give me more than a minute to try to come up with questions about it. Since I have been doing more research the past week, I realized that I have had two outbreaks for the 4 years that I think I have had it, but they were both in the genital region. Every once in a while, for a few days, it hurts to pee too. This would mean I have GHSV-1 right? Can I pass GHSV-1 if I share a drink or kiss somebody? 

Also, I have promised myself that I will disclose every time I may have a physical encounter in the future but it feels like this will destroy my sex life and it’s really bumming me out, even though it’s the right thing to do. It feels like I’ll never have something beautiful or spontaneous ever again, there will always be this skin condition hanging over my head. As douchey as it sounds, I’m 23 and just got out of a 4 year relationship so I want to have that “go to bars, be spontaneous, and hook up” experience but it feels impossible. It’s been a huge hit on my confidence and happiness.

One redeeming thing about the situation is that out of 4 people that I have told that I have it (all friends and family members), 1 said that they are diagnosed also, and 2 of them said that they get cold sores too.

I have had one outbreak so far 

I started off getting really dry, than itchy, than it hurt to pee and I got very swollen , and it hurt to sit as well. When I looked inside it looked like 3 paper cuts inside my vagina. Everything else looked normal . It would be nice to see more people with similar symptoms . I am afraid of a second outbreak, and even more afraid because when I google my symptoms they do not necessarily correlate with “ typical “ herpes outbreak symptoms 


I do not have insurance so I am trying to save the anti medication for emergency’s only …

Disclosure frustrations,"Just needing to vent for a little bit here. First of all, I love this community and have found lots of support within all of your posts. Thank you.
I (31F) met someone (26M)a few weeks ago and everything just clicked. We fell very hard very fast and things got physical pretty quickly. We had everything in common and felt like we had known each other forever. It was definitely a “this only happens once in a lifetime” feelings.
I disclosed before anything physical happened and it was a deal breaker for him. We hung out more and tried to see if we could get past it and talk about it , but ultimately he decided that it was not something he was willing to take on.
I respect his decision 10000%. I know that it’s a lot to handle . Im just really upset and devastated as I was thinking he could be MY person. 
I asked him if he knows his ex didn’t have it ? How does he know she didn’t sleep with someone who has it ? Etc. I get that he’s young and he’s had limited sexual partners. To be honest, I’ve been extremely fortunate in that 90% of my sexual partners have not cared or have worn a condom . So the fact that he is not okay with it, is a huge reality check for me and I’m not sure how to navigate it. I don’t want to downplay his feelings but I also don’t understand throwing away your soul mate for this. . .
Anyway, just needed to vent and get it out in writing. I just hate that something so good has to be ruined by the herpes diagnosis. It’s seriously such a bummer.

I experienced fever , oral thrush, head aches , yeast infection feeling different kind of discharge , the itching and tingling like when u eat a pineapple but i felt it every where including down there I had really bad pelvic pain/ pressure that I never felt like that before ever it was worse then period pain , I also experienced nausea, sensitivity to light my eyes would itch so bad and became very pain full so I thought maybe it was all because it was the first out break , I also experienced lower thigh/leg pan and lower back and but pain. I started noticing a change in my skin under tone and around my eyes and lips , chin and Nose and forehead i  have reddish/whitish millia looking bumps that where not on my face before this first out break anyways I had every symptom that was on google when u search herpes except for the actual sores !  I went to the dr told them my situation and the dr Basically told me there is no way that it would be herpes since she couldn’t get a swab done cause she didn’t see any sores but she did do a yeast infection swab and that came back negative for yeast and she said that the discharge I was getting was do to the hsv1 and 2 any ways I tested for everything and everything came back negative but I just realized that she didn’t test me for syphillis, and I also researched that it could’ve been to soon to test for hiv … so Let’s back track I started kissing/ making out with dude let’s say January 15th , February 15th I went and got tested and results came back negative for everything but hsv1 and 2..she gave me 4 pills of valacyclovir and told me next time I feel these symptoms or  get any cold sores to come and ask for more medicine. Smh I think I tested way to soon okay so now here’s what’s really troubling me so  ever since then I have not been feeling anything but I’ll .  When I asked my dr if I can get the igg levels she basically told me that they don’t do the levels there and that it does not matter where it is orally or genitals. In my blood I have both strains is what she told me!! So anyways after that I was already feeling better slowly because I think I was already getting out of my first out break. So I’m trying to cope with all of this but okay since the dr diagnosed me I have been feeling nothing but Ill , I got my period march 14th and I think during that time I was experiencing my second out break again all the symptoms and no sores ! I felt lower thigh pain, fever, again my eye pain was out of this world and I even noticed I have more little bumps around my eyes nose and mouth that aren’t cold sores but look like tiny little white heads that won’t pop they are all over my eye lids and under my eye and lips and nose and they won’t go away , anyways what’s troubling me now is for ten days straight I have had a ringing in my head and in my ears and awful head aches .. and now I’m scared because it’s not going away idk if I got tinnitus? Or if it can be due another std because I said they never tested me for syphillis and my hiv came back negative but what if I tested to soon for everything?!!! So I’ve be. Having this constant ear and head ringing like it does not stop not one second and my eyes have been so bad I’ve noticed more reddish veins around it  inside my eyes and and I’ve noticed now that my vision has changed dramatically! I’ve had glasses since the 6th grade and my vision has been the same since I was in sixth grade !! I am near sited so I need help seeing far away things but now I can’t even see anything up close ! I put my phone close to my face and I can’t even read the letters and everything is so blurry! And even when I look far I am still super blurry and getting worse ! Am I going blind ? Idk if this can be all from hsv1 and 2 I just feel like there is no  way! And they say that it is rare to catch hsv2 orally but that’s how I got it from making out ! So now tomorrow I booked another dr appointment and I’m going to go and get blood drawn and tested for every std again and I’m going to ask them to std test me for hiv and syphillis again but it’s like I’m scared I’ve been scared to go to the dr because just the hsv1 and 2 has fucked  with my mental health so bad idk how I’m going to handle anything else!

relationship questions,"So myself and my partner were recently diagnosed with hsv 2. I'm still struggling to accept it but I have a few questions.

If we're both positive, unless we get frequent outbreaks is there any benefit to taking anti virals daily?
 Is it bad to have sex if you have an outbreak? can an active outbreak trigger an outbreak in your partner? 
Is there anything else we should know or be careful of? 

Also,  If you already have hsv 1 coldsores, do you get coldsores from both now or do you have to contract hsv 2 orally?

Thanks!",tpvxsm,2,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tpvxsm/relationship_questions/,2022-03-27 19:24:30-04:00

"Can anyone chime in? Just looking for opinions, feeling quite overwhelmed","Hello all,

I was diagnosed via swab with gHSV-1 on my penis just under 3 weeks ago, and the first symptoms came a little before that.  I had two clusters under my foreskin, and a few pimple looking spots on the outside of my foreskin that eventually popped and scabbed over (about the size of very small pimples, or pin points). I took no antivirals, and the sores looked a little better for a while. 

I have nothing external anymore, but beneath my foreskin looks quite red and blotchy.  No big, open painful clusters like before, but some red patches that are redder than the rest.  I’ve always had some irritation under my foreskin, but now with the herpes it’s hard to differentiate between that and an outbreak.  I’ve been using some Ketaconazole cream under my foreskin that my dermatologist told me was okay to use and wouldn’t negatively impact the herpes.  

Just mainly looking for anyone to chime in about their first outbreak and how long it took to heal, and if anyone has had irritation that seems to be a little persistent.  Does this sound normal for a newly diagnosed case of gHSV1?  I’m just so worried about having constant outbreaks and always being symptomatic with a high transmission rate. :(

This is all very new to me and I’m just feeling a bit overwhelmed.  Thanks in advance",tpvmzd,2,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tpvmzd/can_anyone_chime_in_just_looking_for_opinions/,2022-03-27 19:07:59-04:00
Breaking up with the one who gave you HSV,"At the start of Covid I got with a girl from an app. She was nice, if a little naive sexually, and we made a good couple when we both were locking down to avoid Covid. Used condoms, tested before sex, but 6 weeks after our first time, I get a massive outbreak. Went and had the lesions tested and boom, HSV2 confirmed. She says she didn't know she had it, but that she thinks she knows where she got it...

Now today, things are opening back up and I'm not really feeling the relationship. We're still compatible in isolated situations, but when we're with friends, she's just not syncing and I don't want to hang out with her and my friends at the same time... Because of covid, our relationship never really matured, so it's not something I'm invested in, even though it's been 2 years. This is where I'd normally have the break up talk. 

Now here's the question, do you all have some weird attachment to the person who gave you HSV, or do you want to avoid meeting new people because of it? I have never had to disclose. I haven't had to risk that rejection or worry about my partner's exposure. I'm seriously struggling to leave this relationship because it seems easier to just stay and avoid the hassle of having to deal with meeting new people.",tpodcp,5,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tpodcp/breaking_up_with_the_one_who_gave_you_hsv/,2022-03-27 13:12:06-04:00

Help please!,"Hello! At the moment I’m actually really scared, but I’m trying to keep calm. 

A week ago I started feeling some discomfort in my genitals (I’m a female) after having protected sex with a guy. We’ve been having intercourses for almost a year, always with protection. 

At the start I thought it was only discomfort because of the roughness of the sex, but then I started feeling pain. I used some creams for rashes (a safe one) in the hopes that it would help but nothing came of it. When showering I felts the area near my clit like it had some sort of inflammation, and I just ignored it. Today I decided to finally take a photo and see what was going on and I was scared.

The last few days I had a body temperature of almost 100F and my body ached a lot. I thought for a moment I had COVID but the tests came negative. I’m taking some medicines for it and I’m feeling better. But in my genital area I have around three blisters that seem infected… around the area of my clit.

i just got this diagnosis less than a day ago and i am so overwhelmed i don’t even know what questions to ask. i mean i’ve just learned about something i’m going to deal with for the rest of my life. the worst part is my boyfriend shows no signs of genital herpes meaning we’re in a committed relationship (and we’re young and very very sexually active) but i have to try not to give him this virus. how? i love him so much and want to do whatever i can for his health and the health of our relationship.

also, how long does the first outbreak last? i’m miserable right now and just want to feel normal and healthy again. do the sores last longer than the flu symptoms?

I am sick of pretending herpes does not ruin your life,"I am really sorry if that upsets or offends anyone but I need to get this off my chest and rant.

I foubd out a few months ago someone gave me herpes and ever since I have been deeply suicidal, I came online to learn more about it and it is driving me insane. I have had to come to terms with the reality of being a man with herpes.

First of all casual hook ups are basically gone from my life, the same thing that most young people get to enjoy has been taken from me forever by what doctors call a ""simple skin condition"" I have checked online, seen polls and even commemts on here from people like myself who got it saying if they had known they would not have hooked up and why would they? Herpes is literally the only other non curable STD besides HIV and it ruins your life. So from now on I will be the guy who gets rejected 90%+ of the time and be the guy who women discuss with their friends they went home with and he had herpes and they had to go home.

And in the hopes of finding love that has now dropped by a very large margin and not only that if I ever find soneone kind enough to be accepting I have to spend the rest of our relationship worrying that the one kind and accepting person has an ever increasing chance of getting this horrible STD and its not fair on them. They get punished for being accepting and if they are unlucky enough to get severe symptos and pain I will probably have a mental breakdown.

And ontop of that there are millioms out there who have it and dont know or dont care who get to live a somewhat normal life while because I know yet have no symptoms I ""have"" to just accept my sex life is over and tell people and take antivirals that thin my hair and other side effects forever.

There are other more serious illnesses in the world but people are kidding themselves if they say herpes does not ruin a large part of your life as a guy.

Sorry for ranting and I hope life is good for everyone reading but I am going to check out from love/sex and just focus ob other parts of my life and reLise due to herpes love and sex is something you lose due to herpes",tp8is7,34,85,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tp8is7/i_am_sick_of_pretending_herpes_does_not_ruin_your/,2022-03-26 20:31:23-04:00

I have been avoiding any casual relations because I am not mentally ready to disclose again.,"I came out of an abusive relationship nearly a year ago. I contracted HSV2 when I was 19. I was sexually assaulted and a virgin at that time. 

I still remember breaking down after the doctor told me that I had it. There’s still that lingering pain around. I am 26 this year. I had healthy casual relations before I got into a relationship. I always disclosed from the get go and educated many men along the way. 

My ex provided many red flags when we first started dating but I just got comfortable with the fact that someone is willing to be in a relationship with me despite knowing my status. I wanted to leave many times because I knew he was not good for me, but apart from manipulation of telling me he’d change etc, the other reason for staying was, I felt like I’d never get anyone else and the daunting thought of having to disclose again. 

It’s been a year since I’ve had any intimacy and I don’t mind it as I am wanting to focus on myself. But at the same time, I know I am just not mentally ready for when I disclose and I am either treated with rejection (which I don’t mind, but in a fragile state of mind is a bit hard) and or rejection with nastiness. I had one guy I did disclose to and he accepted it, but before we even met, he was already showing signs and I thought to myself, “This is not worth it just because he accepted it.” 

If I could turn back time, I would leave the relationship I had way sooner because despite of my status, I had become accepting of my status and was confident in the past. 

My ex used my status against me, it still plays into my mind. He spat in my face one time and told me, “At least I am not a diseased herpes bitch.”

Treating Cold Sores with laser therapy.,"I’m surprised this isn’t talked about more on this page. But I work In the dental field and I treat Cold Sores via laser therapy all the time. It can only be done at very early stages, ideally when you first feel the “tingling” and before a fluid filled blisters appears. I see really good results, meaning, sometimes it never progresses if done earlier enough, shortens the duration and doesn’t show up in the same spot again. Its also pretty much painless and doesn’t take more then 3-5mins. 
It’s also usually pretty cheapish, my office changes $50. I would say most offices have lasers nowadays but would definitely worth calling to see if your office does.

This involves something new to myself i would like some advice. Skip below to see main questions. Is this herpes on my face? Did my ex give me herpes? 

About me - I am also poliamorous and try to be as ethical as i can and safe as i can. Sometimes ladies lie and things get messy but its pretty hard to fake an std test. I've had my some come out to me about being hsv+ and others that refused to take the test and i made the hard choice to leave sometimes. Or stay and learn. My friends are + we haven't had an issue because it doesn't involve me so i try to respect and understand the situation for anyone. I always ask and I'm getting tested annually and am hyper aware of my skin. Its not healthy mentally i know and i try to stop myself but things pop up only to be vitamin deficiency to fordoyce spots to random cases of ""skin discoloration"" which is a thing that happens with age i guess. I have other issues but we get the point. 

How i possibly got it - i decided to take a break from sex and dating to focus on my career. When a girl that changes plans. I try to resist and she pursues and i genuine liked more than anything for a while. One day (in the middle of covid) i notice is wearing a mask around me more and has a bandaid on her face. I asked what it was and she said a cold sore, i immediately was like what? I had fallen so fuckin quick i skipped my safety procedures. She claimed its not herpes and that her mom (a doc) had said it's not herpes. As the conversation went, She made me feel bad for pursuing the thought and to leave it. It went away in a week as if nothing was there. I kept my distance during that time but we did go on dates and share food and she kissed me once or twice but was sad i wasnt too comfortable with it. We lasted a 16 months or so and this was only one time and no where else did it happen. 

Me - fordyce spots on lip, black heads on lips, dry skin  and chapped lips and canker sores from time time due to tmj and slight tension that moves my jaw. I look normal its like muscle pulls and slight face swelling. Barely noticeable and confirmed by dentist and others but can also cause migraines. I got tested at the end for everything and was fine once again 3 rounds with top tier health insurance at the time. 7 months after, i find another great girl, we went on our second date we made out and she went down on me. We hung out the next day and she had this kind of deep cough and informed me that it could be strep throat. That she always gets cuz lung issues while we were 420... 
The next day the spot appeared in the pink part of my lips. 

The spot is on one side of my corner of my mouth and it looked like a zit. My anxiety hit and i popped it and a white spot came out and some fluid, followed by blood. Symptoms after - its scabed up and the white head came back. Just 1 white zit, no tingles or stinging. I do have some itching but i wear a mask now. Something new and the itching takes place randomly on my upper lip. Never the corners of my mouth. I think its my small mustache with the mask. Ive have had a headache that feels different from my migraines recently though and have been feeling extra dehydrated and groggy at times. No pain on its own. Only when it was scabbed and i streched my mouth. but the white spot grew in the healing process. Not that much but still. Now it feels healed but i have a light spot there now. Is it done healing? Is it herp? Everything is very stressful for me right now.",tpe1q2,1,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tpe1q2/is_this_herpes_or_just_more_anxiety_1st_outbreak/,2022-03-27 02:21:08-04:00

I just got my western blot results...,"And I don't feel anything. Not happiness or sadness like literally feels like nothing has changed. I got a full STD test on Feb of this year per request of a new person I was seeing.  I had confessed to him that my long marriage ended because my ex-husband cheated on me and left me for someone else. This new person was worried, and I completely understood why, and since we were sleeping together already, he was very concerned.As soon as I got my results from Labquest that I had both HSV 1 and HSV 2 , I informed this person, and he immediately told me we shouldn't see each other until he got tested and received his results. I was devastated.

Two and half weeks passed, and I sent him a text that I was worried about him since I hadn't heard from him since that day I told him of my results. He told me that his doctor told him that HSV is no big deal and half of the population has it, but since his results were negative, he didn't want to get exposed by continuing seeing me. To say I was crushed would be an understatement.

I got the results by email today from Terri that I'm HSV 1 positive and HSV 2 negative. But it just doesn't make a difference to me. Herpes is herpes, doesn't matter which one it is, and I'm still depressed about losing this person that I really saw potential to have a relationship with over something so trivial. I'm asymptomatic, and I have never experienced an outbreak, but this has really impacted my life. I know it is not the end of the world, and this is nothing compared to what other people are experiencing that really has an impact like terminal cancer, but I just can't seem to move on.

Some advice please,"21yo male.  
I did an STD test last week because I had unprotected sex with someone questionable on new year's. I have since then gotten a girlfriend who I have been very sexually active with.  
On March 15th, I had unprotected sex with my girlfriend, while she had a UTI (not smart, and yes it was kinda nasty). The following morning, I woke up with a cluster of pimples above my shaft. No pain or anything. I also felt a mild burning sensation when I was peeing, but it was barely noticable.  
I got an STD test the following friday, and last friday I recieved the news that I tested positive on the Herpes IGG test with a score of 1.17. Negative on the IGM test. My doctor told me that I had herpes, and talked about prescribing some medications for it. 

Since then, the pimples went away except one, which I popped (stupid), which formed a into lump on my skin. Another lump appeared on the shaft of my penis. 

As you can imagine, I'm freaking out, and have been diving into research. I see a lot of studies and people saying that low positive scores have a high likelihood of being false positive. a 1.17 is just above the ""equivocal"" barrier on the test.

Do these symptoms sound like herpes, or could it just be bacteria that I caught from my girlfriends UTI? I didn't notice any symptoms following the questionable sex on new years. Only until right after having UTI sex did anything come up. 

I dunno man, I've been really tripping about this for the past couple days. Does it seem pretty likely that I have herpes? Should I get tested again?",tpc17y,1,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tpc17y/some_advice_please/,2022-03-27 00:01:10-04:00
Any support appreciated,"Hi everyone, let me start by saying I’m very new to all of this. I’m a 24 y/o female, still in college, and my life is typically pretty happy. I learned about a month ago that I have both HSV1 and HSV2 which came as a total shock considering I haven’t had any symptoms and I have had a really hard time accepting the diagnosis. I was depressed for a while after learning this and was convinced my sex life was done for. But I found hope a few weeks later when I started dating one of my best friends who I’ve known since my first day of classes at my university. I quickly realized I like him a lot and we took things slow and were having a really wonderful time. When we talked about how we wanted to have sex at some point, I went back to my doctor with a list of questions so that I could become properly educated on the matter and feel more confident about everything. My doctor answered all my questions and told me that it is possible to have a normal sex life which was reassuring to hear. I was extremely anxious about disclosing everything for the first time but knew he had the right to know before we had sex of any kind. I figured if my best friend wouldn’t accept me for this, then who would? So I disclosed it to him and explained the basics on HSV and how I’ve never had any outbreaks, take a daily antiviral, and how my doctor told me I could have a normal sex life. I also told him how my doctor said we could both come in for an appointment if he had any questions about it. Long story short he thought on it for less than a day and then dropped me. He said he didn’t even want to kiss me or cuddle me anymore because of it. I’m still in shock at his reaction and how he went about everything and have since fallen into a dark depression that I have struggled to come out of. It’s just so hurtful and discouraging that my first disclosure resulted in me losing a love interest and one of my best friends. I have started seeing a counselor to cope with everything that has happened in the past month, but sometimes I feel like this is something I will never be able to accept about myself and live with. None of my friends share this diagnosis so any advice, experiences, or words of support from anyone are appreciated.

Could I have transmitted?,"Hello everyone, 

I am worried I could have potentially transmitted hsv to a partner. While I have never had a formal diagnosis I believe I have oral hsv (not sure if 1 or 2). Last Wednesday I had oral sex with my FWB and on Friday night I developed what I believed to be a cold sore (although I am not 100% sure that’s what it was). He texted me today and said he has had what he described as a cold since Wednesday (7 days after his potential exposure). Unfortunately, he didn’t tell me his specific cold symptoms. Could I have transmitted my potential hsv to him? Would hsv cause cold symptoms for 4 days with no OB? I’m not sure where his potential OB would be (oral or genital) and I am really freaking out. He doesn’t have any sores anywhere to my knowledge…..is that a good sign? He knows I get cold sores but I would feel absolutely terrible if I transmitted to him. 

Any words of advice would be wonderful as I am kind of freaking out right now😭

Update: he says he has a sore throat, congestion and headache but did not say if he had a fever. Does this indicate hsv?",tp9irv,1,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tp9irv/could_i_have_transmitted/,2022-03-26 21:28:47-04:00

The skin came off a little and left a shallow sore like spot. There was no pain or fluid. I have no other symptoms other than my usual soreness from friction.

"Was told by two medical professional I likely had Herpes, but I am beginning to doubt it because of difference in symptoms. Still awaiting results 1 week after getting tested. Any insight on what to expect based on my symptoms?","For context: I am male. Age 27. 5'11"" and 180lbs. Physically active, nutritionally healthy. 

In mid-to-late January I had unprotected sex with an on-again-off-again girlfriend. Shortly after, at some point she told me that she had also been sleeping with somebody else on occasion in late November/December/early January. Soon after that, she had told me that he had mentioned that she may need to get tested--but did not specify for what. 

From what I was told by her, both he and she got tested and the results came back negative. I don't really trust them saying that, and I've never seen official documentation to prove it. 

**My symptoms showed up maybe ~3 weeks later:**

* **In mid February I had a single large, dark red, distinct bump on my shaft just beneath the head of my penis.** (It might have been two bumps right next to each other? At this point I'm second-guessing myself) **It was painless** and I only noticed it by chance when I was laying down. 

The following two and a half weeks had me travelling consecutively both for work and pleasure, and I didn't have time to go to a clinic. After some reading I assumed it was probably herpes and I would let the first outbreak run its course before deciding to go to a doctor when I got better. 

* **In late February the sore burst against the pressure of the water in the shower**. This, too, was painless. There was a **mostly sticky, yellow pus/discharge underneath it**. The skin beneath it was raw and deep. Overtime this developed into feeling like scar tissue. 

This was when I initially did begin feeling some pain. The broken skin was raw and uncomfortable when I would go on runs. Sometimes if I was walking especially far. This would also be a problem at night when I would have erections in my sleep or morning wood when waking up. Over time this began to heal but at a snail pace and it is still not done healing.

* **In mid-March I started experiencing new symptoms: an irritable rash-like region on the top of my shaft surrounded by lots of dry flaky skin. A few days later, a single hard white bump appeared underneath the head on the opposite side from the ulcer. A couple days after that, my foreskin (I am circumcised) began swelling immensely. It felt like I had half an erection at all times. There was now more irritation and even some itching.**

This is when I decided to visit an Urgent Care. I told them my symptoms and they said while they did do *some* STD testing, they didn't do enough of a comprehensive one and that I should go to one of the local clinics in my city that did or my primary doctor. They said based upon my description their best guess was probably herpes but I should find out for myself. 

I went to the first available opening at a clinic for testing two days later/this past Tuesday. I described my symptoms and they also said they think it could likely if not probably be herpes, but there is a chance it might be Syphilis instead. The irritation + swelling + flaky/hard skin bumps they said was **Balanitis** and that I likely had a male yeast infection and to get some miconazole cream to treat it with. They did a comprehensive STD test screening (blood, urine, swab on the still yellow+sticky pus/discharge) and told me results will likely take 3-5 days, but they would call me in 1-2 days with some of the initial results to rule a few things out. I've yet to hear anything back. 

Latest developments: 

* I am near the end of week 6 of the ulcer (or 6 weeks since it began as a bump/2 bumps). It is still healing slowly. There is still some yellow sticky discharge/pus.
* After applying the miconazole cream 2-3 times a day, I've seen improvement on the flaky skin + irritation. The white hard bump fell off after two days of use. The rest of the flaky skin is improving but not completely done. The swelling has gone down a lot except for in the area nearest the original ulcer. 
* Today I noticed for the first time that I have some red dots appearing on my trunk. They are near my stomache, chest, sides, and back. It almost looks like a rash but they don't itch at all. 

I'm coming here because I've been lurking through old threads on this subreddit ever since the first bump appeared, but now it seems like my symptoms are deviating from what is the norm for herpes.

Just so sick and tired of getting coldsores...,"First time posting in any sort of coldsore/herpes group... Sort of just a mini rant but also looking for comfort, reassurance, suggestions....




I used to get coldsores rarely. It was like a once-a-year kind of thing since I was 15 (28 now). They've been getting more frequent lately over the past few years and it's scary... I had over four of them one year and had a huge scare when I had two at the same time which had never happened before.. I know stress is a factor and my life has become significantly more stressful since we moved to Colorado to take over my husband's dad's company three years ago..

I went to a dermatologist after the 2-at-a-time scare and he prescribed me valacyclovir but he told me to only take 1000mg twice a day when I feel it coming on. He told me if I took 1 when I noticed it coming on and 1 before bed that same day, that it should prevent it from actually forming..The bottle (and the internet) say 2000mg twice a day but i did what the dermatologist told me. I never felt it was working and always still had to use Abreva and suffer for over a week..   

I had a coldsore in late February this year and it ended up lasting over 2 weeks.. I woke up this morning feeling a bump where I had been tonguing a cut from biting my lip accidentally last week. Here we go again 😭 I know I should have left the cut alone... It feels like every time I have even the slightest cut on my lip it turns into a coldsore... This one is the farthest away from my usual breakout spot too which is terrifying... It used to just be the right side of my lips and this is on the left side near the center.. 

I'm just feeling really... defeated.. disgusting... losing all my self confidence.. I hate it. I hate that I can't kiss my husband, I hate the constant fear of spreading it to other people or to other areas of my body. I over-wash my hands and panic constantly.. I feel gross... I feel undesirable.. I'm just so tired of it and how frequently they occur. I become a hermit when I have a coldsore, out of embarrassment... I have a solid fear of it becoming a permanent thing.. like a coldsore that won't go away that everyone can see and immediately know that I have herpes...

I'm seeing a best friend next Friday, a college friend a couple days later, then flying to my college bff's engagement party the following weekend. Like.. the timing just sucks... I have to get rid of it...

I had three valacyclovir pills left this morning and I took 2 immediately when I knew it was a coldsore.. (idk how I have an odd number, probably forgot to take the night pill one time). It costs me $50 to refill the prescription without a doctor's scrip and I'm planning on doing that again today since the dermatologist is closed until Monday... That way I can take another 2 tonight before bed and hopefully it will go away... This is my first time trying to take 2 in the morning and 2 before bed.. I'm almost afraid to use Abreva because I feel like Abreva speeds up the whole process and it will become a full blown coldsore by tomorrow...

Does anyone have any amazing, incredible, and effective remedies for a coldsore that's just starting? Or at least making it go away within a few days rather than over a week? I'll try anything at this point... I just had one and I'm so sick and tired of how constant they're becoming.. This is my second one this year and we're only in the third month.... 

Halp.

ETA: Just found out I cannot refill my prescription today since there are no more refills left and the doctors office is closed today... pharmacist suggested teladoc or something to get a new prescription but I've never used that before... just sitting in bed crying from all the stress and frustration...",tosvc6,1,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tosvc6/just_so_sick_and_tired_of_getting_coldsores/,2022-03-26 11:29:43-04:00

Girl I’m dating disclosed HSV1 to me.,"Hey everyone,

A girl (32) I’m dating recently told me (male 32) that she has HSV1.

We talked about it a bit, it sounds like it’s had a real impact on her life and self esteem, which is horrible. I thanked her for telling me and told her I needed time to understand it before deciding where we go next.

After doing some reading it blew my mind to discover how prevalent it is. It also appears like it’s really just a minor inconvenience from a health perspective; she doesn’t take meds, has about one outbreak a year and was in a four year relationship where it never transmitted to her partner (m) who she was having unprotected sex with. From a stigma perspective, it seems like way more of a burden. Sorry to all of you that have to carry that.

My question to you is, if you were me (HSV negative): A) what would you want to know that I might not B) What would you do if you could wind back the clock to before you think you contracted HSV1?",tntdf1,54,69,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tntdf1/girl_im_dating_disclosed_hsv1_to_me/,2022-03-25 13:43:47-04:00

Cold Symptoms or Not?,"Hi,

This is a follow up to my previous post. Since then, I’ve been reading the archives trying to find information without bothering or bugging any of you again in this method.

I know that every human being is different, our bodies and immune systems are different and therefore, symptoms can be different. But I do see a lot of people in this sub that have  said a sore throat/coughing and other cold (as opposed to flu) like symptoms proceeded or accompanied their outbreaks.

As I’ve mentioned before, my friend recently diagnosed with GHSV and on her period and possibly on antivirals stayed with me for a few days, as did another friend. I had the most direct skin to skin contact when rubbing cream on her back where there were pimple-like spots (but since she didn’t know for a while during her first OB, I’m not sure if self inoculation occurred). I am the only friend that is sick. Sore throat all one day, less sore throat and cough the next, now cough and stuffy nose. On/off, I feel fine but then the cough and stuffy nose always remind me that I had the sore throat (five days after she first came) and that I have a cold?

I trust her to wash her hands each time she uses the bathroom, but I saw her searching for her tampon once and then finding it and closing the door with her bare hands. I assumed after 10 seconds, it would be fine, but I’m not sure if living with her for a few days could’ve somehow passed it, especially since my skin is already cracked and torn due to over washing (not burning when sanitizer is applied, but peeling and flaking due to dryness).

I think I am still worried because of the posts in the archives with common cold symptoms and the fact that my other friend is perfectly fine.

((TL;DR)) So, are common cold symptoms symptomatic of having caught herpes from fairly casual contact and would over washed hands provide a direct route?",tooold,1,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tooold/cold_symptoms_or_not/,2022-03-26 09:38:36-04:00

Sex in long term discordant relationships,"Ok I have a question. What are peoples practices in long term relationships? I have genital HSV2 and he does not. We both take antivirals (he has oral hsv 1 and gets regular outbreaks without) and we use condoms. We have been in a committed relationship for 2 years. At some point in my life I want to enjoy condomless sex again. He gets nervous about our body parts touching, and this can impact foreplay and my mood during sex. I have expressed my desire ditch the condoms someday in the future, but every time we talk about it he tells me he really doesn’t want to get herpes and doesn’t feel comfortable going without, probably forever. Which honestly I understand that no body “wants” herpes. But, after 2 yrs I was hoping he would accept me with HSV2, the decision to wear condoms forever feels like he doesn’t. Am I crazy for letting this be an issue? I want to respect his body/his choice. But I feel like he doesn’t accept me completely. What are pols thoughts?

wholesome acceptance,"So I've always done my best to monitor my health, and be honest with my intimate partners.  I've never tested positive for an STI. I've been much more active and careful about testing between partners, discussing, and asking others to test/disclose ever since receiving a mass text (!) from a person I slept with years ago (2015 or 16 ?) saying that ""if you're receiving this, please get tested""... she had gonorrhea, if I recall correctly, whatever it was, it was treatable... long story short, I got a ""full panel"" and had all negatives. Her example was really inspiring.  I have no idea how many partners she had, but I'm sure it was a significantly higher number than me. No shame on her, she was a lively gal and  actually sounds like she was having a lot of fun 🤣

Anywho,  I was fresh out of a breakup from a long distance relationship back in autumn 2020. We were monogamous, and I hadn't slept with anyone but her in 4 years, fairly certain she was 100% faithfully monogamous too. Hadn't seen her since Feb 2020. Pandemic really ruined our relationship. Long distance and no end in sight to separation. I'll spare the details, but it was tough losing the relationship. It was almost a year after the breakup that I started trying to date in earnest.  I met a really nice girl who I liked a lot,  and I thought it was the right thing to do to get tested just as a general courtesy to anyone I might start a relationship with.  Went on a few dates with this girl, we really started enjoying each other (no pants off dance-off, just a lil smooch here n there thus far). Got my test results back, and everything was clear except an equivocal result for HSV2. I was kinda shocked, because to my knowledge, all my past partners were negative,  no known exposure to STIs. I was kinda shook honestly, but since I was early on in my budding friendship with this new girl,  I took her on a nice hike and we sat down at the peak to rest and have a snack and I just busted it out and told her what was going on. I explained that I've never had symptoms, and I was shocked to receive an equivocal result. I told her that I've learned there can be false positives and that I was asked to test again.  My doc told me that they wanted to see if my body would ""clear the infection"". Not sure if the context that I hadn't slept with anyone in like 18 months really translated to them... anyway, when I told this new girl I was dating,  she surprised me with completely wholesome acceptance. Her response was basically that she wasn't worried about it.  She explained she had a past partner who was hsv2 positive, that she didn't contract it, and tested negative since then.  Getting it off my chest was a huge relief which was exponentially multiplied by her understanding and appreciation for my openness. 

I have since tested two more times,  1 month later and 4 months later than that. Both results were low equivocal range.  Really kinda frustrating because I'm not sure what to do with that info, and don't really know if I should pay for a western blot. Meanwhile, just wanted to share with this community the positive experience of being honest and having that honesty returned with genuine understanding.  We have been dating for 6 months now,  and I've been thinking of asking her if she'd like to cohabitate. Really like her a lot, she's crafty, quite caring, and we have shared hobbies. Also FWIW,  we met  online, and I have always had incredibly low expectations about dating apps, but apparently there are some good human beans out there who are looking for some gentle companionship.

Awareness + Advocacy for Women + Moms w/ HSV,"Sorry for the long post but this must be addressed ...

From the hsv message boards and groups I am a part of to keep me sane + realize I'm not alone , there is a common thread I'm noticing - WOMEN ARE SUFFERING!!!! It seems that outbreaks are closely tied to our hormones . Doctors don't seem equipped to help us. I see ladies who are scared to get pregnant , women suffering with outbreaks through pregnancy , and those like me suffering after childbirth with no solution offered other than valtrex, which isn't working . They say HSV is not deadly . How do they know that ? How many people have suffered in silence and perhaps taken their own lives bc no one could help? How many people are beat down daily and their mental health is suffering tremendously? This is no way to live . For many of us , we didn't ask for this . How are we supposed to get over trauma when we are forced to relive it with each outbreak? I am not ready to tell the world I have HSV. I don't think I ever will be . But I want to work behind the scenes and advocate for better quality of care when it comes to this horrible disease . Where can I start ? Who is with me? This simply cannot go on. I'm not one to stand by and let this ruin my life another day bc let me tell you , it has beaten me down so badly this past year - I'm not quite sure how I've survived. They say it gets better and symptoms lessen with time and from what I've been experiencing and reading in message boards , that's not the case ! We have to start somewhere . If you have any ideas , suggestions, etc please lmk ! I can't go one like this . My son needs me to be healthy and vital. I keep telling myself it will pass and it just feels like it's never ending .

Tell me your thoughts …..,"Ending Stigma - Just a thought …….
Yesterday I tried posting this post maybe I chose the wrong subreddit where it was not allowed but it never posted so I figured I would try again here. 

I shared how since my diagnosis on Dec. 2020, I have just been really thinking n wishing there was some way to make this disease more known, ppl need to be educated and just be more aware so that also the horrible stigma can somehow be less or changed completely! 

I was thinking what if HSV was blasted all over the world using billboards, digital billboards like the ones in Times Square, Tv commercials n radio. These could include EVERYTHING.. from education on the difference between HSV1 and HSV2, signs and symptoms, statistics on exposure, statistics on how common it is, benefits of being with someone knowing their status and actively under treatment, education on who can get it - from a person losing their Virginity their 1st time to a person with 1k partners, treatments n medications available now, research n studies happening, ways to donate and encouragement to get checked and ask for HSV as this is not commonly tested during regular std panels etc. 

Marketing- how and who presents it would also be a huge deal on how this message is perceived so using humor , maybe stand up comedy clips of comedians talkn about having herpes , or using those comedians as presenters or the awesome influencers on YouTube or Tik Tok that speak about their experiences with herpes doing the commercials or even respected celebrities who could at least acknowledge, maybe relate or in a way inflict compassion and respect for the disease in someway. 
This way we can also beat the pharmaceutical companies that make those horrible commercials n make ppl like us look like monsters and untouchable bc we have herpes!! 💪🏼

I used to feel like I wanted to hide under a rock, prayed the topic was never brought up and I never had to face it but .. that’s inevitable and only makes the stigma worse ! Ppl need to know the real truth about HSV and be educated period ! The more ppl know the less of a deal it becomes and the better for us! I’ve also started to learn and accept that if someone is even worth a damn they won’t automatically dismiss you or not accept you bc of HSV and they will at least want to get educated and see the good qualities about you !!! So ultimately if you fuck with me with my HSV great and if you don’t okay …. Keisha carry on !!  ✌🏼 lol 

Anyways wish I knew someone very wealthy that could make this happen ! Lol Let HSV be everywhere !!! Eff it !!!!

First off, I am decently educated on the symptoms and mode of transmission of herpes. I mostly want a second opinion on the appearance because of my lack of experience actually seeing herpes in person (and google doesn't help much). I currently do not have any systemic symptoms, and the bumps are not sore or irritated. The ones on the right are similar to razor bumps that I get regularly in that areas, but the ones on the left look different. The grouping is tighter, they are more peaked, and at least one of them has a little bit of a whitehead. I've also had ingrown hairs that kind of look similar to that but never this many, this close to each other. 

And before you ask, yes I have had sexual excounters with multiple people recently; and they were without protection unfortunately.

Newly Diagnosed HSV-1 Questions (M25),"Hello,

I hope everyone on here is doing well! I am a 25 year old male who was recently diagnosed with HSV-1 and had a few questions that I am hoping could be answered. Ever since my diagnosis, I have been reading so many posts on here and just wanted to give a sincere shoutout to the community and how supportive they are for diagnosed people.

This diagnosis has come as a complete surprise (although I guess I shouldn't be - more on that below) as I have been asymptomatic for the most part.

I received unprotected oral sex (no other contact or kissing) from someone who had no visible sores. After 11 weeks since this one-time exposure, I got a full STD panel test and tested negative for everything except HSV-1 at an igG value index of 47.6. I was wondering if this is likely from a previous exposure or likely the most recent one 11 weeks ago? I know that igG values don't represent location or when it was contracted, but I was wondering what the likely scenario is given that the value is so high.

The exposure before this was also a one-time exposure in the beginning of July 2021 (approximately 8 months ago). I received protected oral sex and intercourse (no kissing). However, the female did suck on my testicles and spit on my penis a couple times and proceeded to masturbate me. I was wondering if this was a high risk exposure? There were no visible sores either but I know this does not mean the virus is not contractable. I did have some weird symptoms on my genitals. Urge to urinate, incomplete emptying of bladder right after urinating - I actually still have these lingering symptoms until today. I was tested for UTI but was negative so not sure what it was. It might be important to note I was extremely stressed with work during this period so I'm wondering if that's the cause even though those symptoms still come and go when I'm not stressed anymore.

Lastly and the most probable scenario: I dated someone for two years who did have cold sores time to time. I wasn't really aware of how contagious cold sores are and did not even know they were herpes. We shared utensils, lip balm, and engaged in all sorts of unprotected acts. I remember possibly having a primary OB on my lip (right on top of it). Although, I can't tell for sure because I assumed it was a pimple although it seemed a bit different than my usual acne. Even my dad commented on how it looked a bit strange. That was a little more than 2.5 years ago and haven't had any known outbreaks since then (knock on wood).

Basically, I was wondering what the community thought of each of these exposures and how high risk each exposure was. Obviously, I am thinking I contracted it from my long-time ex but wanted to see what the community thought of the most recent two exposures. Lastly, given that I am asymptomatic, other than disclosure to future partners, is there anything I should do differently? Is it still recommended to take the anti-viral drugs?

It's been a hard couple weeks since diagnosis but I have come to accept the fact and trying to grow from it. Thank you in advance for taking the time to read this lengthy post and I hope everyone stays healthy and safe! Will make sure to reply to everyone who replies.

Disclosure,I have hsv2.... I am scared of disclosing in fear someone could possibly use it against me or make me feel dirty. My sister has hsv1 she told me a story about how someone threatened to kill her after she told them. Why do people who have hsv have to disclose if everyone's gonna get by the time they get old. Why can't we just continue to live our lives freely regardless? No one's going to die. Why can't we feel like ourselves before the diagnosis? I really hate that I can't fully be my sexual self. It sucks sometimes I want to just meetup and fuck someone without disclosing. This shit sucks. Literally I don't want to tell anyone but I'm also not use to being a liar. I hate that for myself bcuz I want to stay true to myself but this virus is a part of me so how can I not disclose. Also a lot of the older generation didn't go around disclosing as much bcuz they knew it wasn't that deep to have. This sucks🥲🥹... Why should we feel dirty or have to expose ourselves to random strangers to hook up. The only way I really see myself exposing myself is before I get into a relationship but for hookups idk... I'll never see the person again. I literally got hsv2 from my boyfriend not knowing he had it. I wasn't mad at him when I found out bcuz we both decided to have sex. Life goes on and sex is sex... Stds should be normalized... At some point everyone will have already carried some form of it🥹,tnldvb,7,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tnldvb/disclosure/,2022-03-25 08:59:39-04:00
Need some help,"Hey guys- just looking for some advice and input. I have ghsv1, I was diagnosed the end of last month. I had the first initial outbreak which cleared up in about a week. I keep hearing mixed feelings about taking acyclovir and or valacyclovir. Some say it’s best to only take it when having an outbreak, some say it’s best to take it daily to avoid outbreaks and to try to help protect who you’re intimate with. I’m only worried about taking it daily because I don’t want my body to depend on it and have bad outbreaks if I ever stop or miss a day or two. (Read that’s What happens to a lot of people) my question is: if ghsv1 has low shedding rates, and I don’t have many outbreaks is it even worth starting the medication?",tnq2sh,3,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tnq2sh/need_some_help/,2022-03-25 12:35:32-04:00

Another post disclosure disclosure,"Another cute boy told me about his gHSV2 only after I disclosed my gHSV1. And he made it out to be no big deal. I was very nervous as he was getting all hot and heavy in the conversation and I didn’t want to go too far down the road and then get rejected. 

I am at the point where it’s just on my profile and it’s just a point of general discussion. 

I’ve had not had good luck getting people to disclose their status. 

Still not sure how I’m feeling about all this. I feel it important to disclose this so we can move our lives forward. 

Should I even care if I’m on antivirals, and use protection? No one really seems to care (or it’s not a big deal).

Western Blot finally taken from doctor and results back in less than a week. Safe to say its nice to know exactly whats going on in my body… I guess.,"I had hoped the numbers would be kind to me but that “false positive” range can be one hell of a bitch. Blood tested at IgG 2.29 for my second blood test and followed up with a WB about 4 months (maybe 5?) later. Came back positive. 

I was on the subreddit for a while and talked to a few individuals about how low IgGs can mean so many things and to get the WB to be completely sure, so you bet I was hot on that trail. Finally convinced a doctor within my regular practice to order it for me at a very reasonable price, thank god. Honestly what a gem. 

Ive been living as if im positive of course (hoping i might be negative), and as Ive put in a couple previous posts Ive been with a partner who has been very accepting of my diagnosis. He was my first disclosure, and thankfully was a very positive an empowering experience. Its been wonderful. We decided a couple weeks ago it would be best for him to also get blood tested just for good measure, and his came back at IgG .90 and he just laughed it off. I cant imagine being that light hearted but he’s made this whole experience much easier to navigate and deal with.

Still not showing symptoms which I suppose is a huge relief. Just going to take this day by day and hopefully make it just “one more thing” and take them vitamins.

My achy breaky ... body?,"So, I'm a first timer, just had my first cold sore outbreak on Tuesday. I likely got it from my wife, who has oral HSV1, in a momentary lapse of judgement when we accidentally kissed shortly after she caught a sore before it broke the skin. I'm not mad or upset, in fact, if it hadn't happened when it did, it'd probably happen a couple of years from now. We're taking it in stride.

However, aside from the war zone that is my upper *and* lower lip, my body has seemingly ached for three straight days. Advil seems to help subside the overall malaise but I definitely haven't felt 100% all week. My dermatologist prescribed me Valtrex, which I just took this morning, and I'm actually still waiting on the culture swab to come back. I've tested negative for COVID-19, no fever, and I don't have any other symptoms other than swollen lymph nodes in my neck. My mouth and gums are still a little sore but not as bad as before the sore broke free.

How long did the achy, tired, run down feeling last for y'all? I'm on day three and feeling miserable because it's making it hard to get comfortable in any capacity. 🤞🏻 I'm hoping the worst of it will be over soon!

"Girlfriend has herpes, how to support?","Hey all, a little bit of context. My most recent ex had herpes, but only orally. I was with her three years, so I always assumed I had it in some capacity, but didn’t get flare ups. I told my current girlfriend this, so she knew it was a risk. Long story short, I had an outbreak that I didn’t realize was an outbreak and now she’s tested positive for it. 

She’s scared, worried, doesn’t like the unknown element of it all. What can I tell her to best support her? I work in healthcare so I don’t see herpes as anything more than an STD, but she has been raised with the stigma of seeing herself as unclean for having it.

"Anxious, Panicked regarding my diagnosis and future.","Gay, male, 30. I just got my diagnosis (HSV2) and started Valtrex yesterday. I’m totally obsessing about it which is causing major anxiety and I’ve even came close to a panic attack. Luckily I am prescribed Klonopin for severe anxiety but I don’t think taking klonopin every day is the right solution although I did need one this morning. 

I understand that the virus itself is mild but I’ve always enjoyed a fun and healthy sex life. I didn’t get this on a hook up, my ex boyfriend didn’t tell me he had HSV2. I saw that he had Acyclovir and he told me it was just for cold sores. When I texted him that I tested positive he stopped replying. Now I’m freaking because Im afraid that im no longer desirable, that I could infect someone else, that I can’t have a care free attitude about sex anymore, that guys won’t be interested and most of all that I will be stigmatized as being extremely promiscuous or unclean.

How did you deal with it when you got your diagnosis? How do you deal with the anxiety of your initial diagnosis? I have no one to talk to because I frankly all of my friends gossip and I’m from an Irish catholic family. I’m in therapy but only a scheduled appointment once a week. Idk I’m going to manage my Klonopin dosage very carefully and try not to take it tomorrow.

Unique walk down H Lane....years later still not completely sure?,"Hi, I am a 24yo gay male and I'm definitely a herpes ally (may be silly to say but it's true!), definitely an oHSV carrier, and quite possibly a gHSV carrier. I'll start with some background as then get into my most recent SYMPTOMS. Yes I read the rules on symptoms. I'm going to explain the confusing occurances that have me posting here this evening.

**BACKGROUND**

Child. Cold sores. Like half of the population. We get it.

* Now as an adult, I may get a cold sore every couple of years or so.

19 years old, I have bumps on my junk. Shitty Urgent Care doctor says herpes. No pain, did not even look like herpes. Calls for a blood test. Came back as HSV+....duh, cold sore history.

* Gets call at 8am while still in bed before work. Nurse tells me I have herpes for the rest of my life, have a nice day.
* 19yo me spent WEEKS going down the rabbit hole, thinking my sex life was over, all the terrible things that unfortunatley I know many on this forum are familiar with.
* Thru this however, I became educated realizing the truth, and having had cold sores occasionally in my life made me more familiar/I guess you could say I was slightly more ""comfortable..."" than others would be accepting this.
* Basically came to terms with having herpes...told my parents and even told a potential partner and he was accepting...
* Go on Valtrex, NO CLEARANCE OF SYMPTOMS.

About 4 weeks after the initial diagnosis I see a real doctor, a dermatologist.

* Views my bumps, immediately says it is not herpes, but rather Moluscom Contagioso (sp?), a random ass skin infection that is common in kids, although can be passed thru the genitals in adults too.
* Tells me that the blood test should be considered INCONCLUSIVE, all about how the CDC doesn't recommend the blood tests, that the only way to be sure is to test the fluids from an active infection.
* He burns those bumps off and I'm good as new. Definitely NOT herpes, lol. That would fucking kill.

\~ Past 5 years I've openly been a herpes ally. Any time the topic comes off in a negative light, I'm quick to defend. I've been there, and I know that a huge portion of the population is there, even if they don't know it yet. Should not be stigmatized the way it's been. We all know that. \~

To this date, my total body count is probably 40 people, maybe 50. I am the one to initiate the STI talk before sex every.single.time. I am on PrEP for HIV, and used to use condoms almost always, although I've had unprotected sex with probably 15-20 of those partners after we both disclose that we were both recently tested and I feel decently comfortable. In my life I've had chlamydia twice and ghonnorea once. So, kinda promiscuous but I literally make a point to be responsible more than most people I know...(damn, maybe that's my problem).

**2 Weeks Ago. 24yo (FIRST TRUE OUTBREAK?) These are how my symptoms went:**

* Trims pubes. Cuts my penis where the shaft meets scrotum. Has rough sex a few hours later. Being circumcised, sometimes when I penetrate a partner my penis gets considerably irritated on the sides from the friction with the anus, hair, etc.
* Later that night and the next day, I could feel the residual pain, sort of like brush-burn from the friction on my penis. (TMI but this is why I should just bottom, lol). This is honestly COMMON when I top. (thanks for circumcising me, mom & dad – not). Since this is common I didn't think anything of it...
* Approx 3 days later, however, I notice 3 tiny scabs on the area where my I cut, had the brushburn. Never had scabs like that down there before....The scabs remain for a few days, don't really change, and it does NOT HURT at this point. Since the scabs were 3 tiny little circles, however, I got suspicious – Didn't look like how you'd expect a brush-burn scab to look like when you scraped your knee at the park.
* Go to sexual health doctor where I get my normal STI screenings and PrEP. This place is legit and they offer Primary Care too. The doctor says it does NOT look like herpes and so she runs tests for everything else.... Everything Negative.
* OK. Life as usual. Couple days later, the scabs come off. Looks like some lowkey scar tissue, as expected under any scab. STILL NO PAIN.
* Now, I get suspicious though because like, the circles are just so circular....(lmfao) I'm like, this has to be some sort of infection; cuts don't look like that. So, thinking it was an infection, I made an effort to like thoroughly clean it in the shower, since I was more delicate before because I didn't want to rip the scabs off prematurely.
* THIS IS WHERE THE PAIN STARTS. Idk if my charcoal body wash irritated the wounds, but from here on, it HURTS. This is like an entire week after the first onset of the tiny scabs before it even begins to hurt. Upon cleaning the area, it went from what looked like a healthy, healing scar to a pissed-off open sore. Fuck. 
* The original 3 pissed-off open sores open up a Satellite Sore near the head of my penis now. Much smaller, and the new one actually doesn't hurt. This is where I figure this has to be herpes. That is not normal of a brush-burn to spread like that. The sores hurt at this point, kind of firey/tingly like a cold sore. I figure, yep, it's herpes...
* so I go BACK to the doctor to be sure and get the proper test done while the sores are there. He digs the cotton swab in my sores and it fucking HURTS like he's poking a hot needle in my dick. He's like ""Yeah this is a special type of cotton that is really good at picking up viral material. If you have H, it'll show"".
* Waiting my results, I kept the sores under vaseline because IDK what to do. However, EVERY TIME I CLEAN THEM, THE SORES OPEN UP AND SOME YELLOWISH FLUID COMES OUT for like 15 min or so until I'm completely air dried. At this point I'm like completely certain I have herpes, and although it's tricky/stressful to think about disclosure and everything, I'm honestly just accepting that I have it. Life goes on, my past has literally GEARED ME UP for this.
* **MY SWAB RESULTS COME BACK NEGATIVE** !?!?!?!
* I am literally just confused. I know herpes sucks, I know HSV and all its variants suck, and some people's cases are more serious. But, we also know that soo many people have it and pass it on having no idea. I'm just sitting here like...SO DO I HAVE IT OR NOT? But more importantly, since I don't have a super straight answer, do I disclose this entire novel to potential partners?!? LMFAO – This roller coaster of a skin rash y'all. 

Please do not take my 'lmao's as anything but my own self-coping mechanism after having thought/known/idk that I have herpes for the past 5 years. And after all this recent stuff I felt so sure, But then a negative result from the open sores.

What do you guys think about the sequence of my symptoms?

I had no pain/signs/inklings before the first small scabs showed up. Normally before getting a cold sore, I feel it coming on the day before. Didn't get that sensation this time. But ever since I broke them open cleaning in the shower, it has this familiarly firey tingly feeling which is what made me assume it must be herpes. And the fact that the one little guy showed up later...

&#x200B;

Leave this all behind me and live life as normal until I have 100% confirmation? Or what do y'all think?

&#x200B;

"How to tell if cold sore, pimple or angular cheilitis?","I’m prone to angular cheilitis/cracked corners of my lips, and last night made a comment about one of the corners of my mouth feeling sore/cracked after drinking less water than usual and wearing a mask all week. I slathered some lip balm on it and went on with my life. About an hour later I felt a bump on the border of my lip right beside the corner (but not in the exact corner, on bottom lip right beside the corner) that had developed a small white head and felt painful, with red around it. 

Last time something like this happened was 3-4 years ago and I just assumed it was a pimple. I popped it/picked at it and it turned into a scab on the edge of my mouth and I remember complaining that it looked like I had a cold sore. From what I remember, the scab mostly affected the skin outside my lip and honestly didn’t look any different than a pimples I’ve picked at on other parts of my body. But I know now that HSV-1 is way more common than I realized and that for a lot of people, cold sores really do look just like pimples. 

It currently just looks like a big pimple, it’s a bit sore but pimples also hurt! There was no numbness/tingling/itching/symptoms in the days leading up, but once I started thinking it could be a cold sore I started to feel those things, but I have anxiety and have given myself fake symptoms before when I’ve been paranoid about specific conditions. 

Any advice would be appreciated, since it could be 3 things and only one of them is highly contagious. I’m also nervous because if this is a cold sore, then the pimple from 3 years ago was probably also a cold sore. I’ve had a few different sexual partners since then (never during the period there was anything on my mouth) that I never disclosed HSV status to, because I didn’t know that what it (possibly) was. Should I reach out to them and let them know, even though none of them are current partners? I’m having a hard time knowing where the line between honest communication and paranoia is, and I’d hate to tell somebody “I might have given you herpes a couple years ago without knowing sorry lol” if that’s not the case, you know?",tnl11l,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tnl11l/how_to_tell_if_cold_sore_pimple_or_angular/,2022-03-25 08:39:56-04:00

My new boyfriend gave me HSV 2,"I started feeling symptoms a few days ago I thought it was a vaginal tear at first. The blister were from just recently shaving and ingrown hair. Which I normally do get a bit off. 

My boyfriend 22M And Me 19F 
We just started dating about a weak or so. We did moves pretty quickly to having sex. I knew I was clean before this cause I recently got tested also in late February and haven’t had unprotected sex since. Until it was with him. So when I started to feel the symptoms I told him to get tested again but specifically for Hsv 1 & 2. Cause I noticed on his tested paper before that those were the exact ones missing. Which I found very odd. But he said he didn’t know cause he told his doctor for everything and he thought they did and the lab apparently made a mistake. 
We’ll come to find out yesterday he tested positive. I was shocked but I didn’t know what to do. He was worried I was going to hate him and leave him because of it. But I mostly just brushed it off and said we now just stuck with each other. Besides me finding out he gave me hsv. He’s a really sweet loving and caring guy and has been the best since the relationship started. We both have met each other’s parents and hang out almost everyday before or after work.

Well I still don’t know how to feel about finding out I have this. And I live in a really small city. Where everyone talks about everyone business and we don’t want it spreading that we have something like this. Because we will both just be viewed badly. We agreed to hide it from everyone. And just stick to ourselves.

I also told him. How I have no healthcare insurance. He will have to pay for my medication expenses for a while.And take me to get treated because my symptoms are becoming very annoying and painful.

I have done some research to understand more about this. But I still need all the information I can get. 

So for anyone that is a carrier for HSV 2 can you let me know as much information I need to know for someone who just got it and is pretty new to it.

How do I avoid giving people herpes in martial arts?,"I've given up on ever doing grappling arts like judo and wrestling because of the grappling and sweaty rolling, so I'm going into kickboxing which is way less intimate. I've ordered moisture dry-wicking fabrics to wear underneath my clothes for both my torso, arms, and legs so sweat doesn't get everywhere. I have HSV-1 and HSV-2, both diagnosed. I'm not really worried about transferring HSV-2 because not only will my sweat fabrics and clothes cover my entire crotch lower area, I've never gotten a genital outbreak since my initial. I'm also take 1000mg valacyclovir a day, l lysine and vitamin c. My areas of concern are mainly my face  and hands outbreaks from HSV-1. I figure that for sparring I could wear headgear with a faceshield which prevent sweat and saliva contact but for my hand outbreaks, sometimes our coach makes us do a drill were we punch eachother in the stomach for 5 minutes without gloves so im not sure what do there, unless I can find smaller moisture absorbant mma gloves to cover my hands.

Don’t know what else I can do! Need help urgently!,"Don’t know what else I can do

Hi
I’m a male 23
So just a brief history about 5 years ago I got circumcised and a few days during my recovery I started developing some small itchy clustered rash on the tip of my penis and i was told it’s herpes. The doctor didn’t conduct any tests. She just looked at and said it’s herpes. She gave me some meds for the itching and sent me on my merry way. I wasn’t even counciled on how to live with it. Anyway long story short after that it cleared and I’ve been fine 

But starting last year I developed a lump in my groin area on the upper right area between my testicles and thigh which was painful and not going away. I saw a series of doctors starting from a general doctor who was no help at all then moved to a dermatologist and now 
I’ve been having issues with lump like boils appearing all over my groin area I saw a dermatologist and he treated me with antibiotics for a month and some cream 
But it didn’t help. And he seems to be clueless on what it could be. He then told me we have to collect puss from the boils but the problem is the boils aren’t releasing any puss. So he literally told me there’s nothing he can do until the puss starts coming out. And I observed that it seems to get disturbed if I masterbate. Idk if there’s any relation between the two or not. 
Has anyone gone through anything similar? Is it herpes or could it be something else?

Partner was diagnosed with HSV2,"I met a wonderful woman who I’d like to pursue a relationship with. When we met we had sex (used condoms) and we decided before we met up again we would both get tested for STIs so we could enjoy each other without the feel of latex. She came back positive for HSV2. 

I talked to my doctor about. Said if that was the only thing holding me back from seeing her it’s not a good enough reason. Especially if she’s taking medication. 

I agreed that I would see her again to see where things go. I requested she start taking medication which she had no problem with. 

I’m a little nervous about potentially catching HSV2. I already have HSV1. (I disclosed this to her) It just seems so nonchalant to have oral herpes but if you have genital herpes people act like it’s the end of the world. 

Also, statistically you’re less likely to catch herpes from a partner who manages their symptoms and is aware of there status over casual sex partners who may not know, or even mention anything about having herpes. 

If an average of 1 in 6 people has HSV2, divide my body count by 6, I’ve probably had sex with 10 women who have HSV2. And this is only the second woman to disclose this to me. 

Seems like I’m really anxious about nothing. Has anyone been in a similar situation? Did you rely on only medication for prevention of transmission? Or did you use condoms? Both? Did you regret it?

How to talk about false positives?,"Hey all.

I wanted to ask about something that I haven’t really seen discussed, both on this subreddit and on the internet, generally.

Some personal history: last year, I underwent STD testing for the first time and received a surprise low positive of 1.47. A follow-up test came back with a second low positive of 1.51. I followed up with a Western Blot…which came back indeterminate (yay). I’ve never had an outbreak and have had an exclusive partner for 7 years (who has consistently tested negative).

Recently, I decided I wanted answers and got in touch with Terri, who offered to help me redo the Western Blot. As I suspected and as available resources have led me to believe, Terri’s opinion was that protein(s) in my blood have triggered false positives. With that said, she also told me that people who receive false positives (and/or indeterminate WB results) will typically *continue* to receive false positives simply due to their body chemistry.

*Given this, I’m curious if anyone here has experience or advice regarding explaining false positives to partners. Do I mention it? If they ask about my STD status, do I disclose? Do I ask for an STD panel that excludes HSV-2? Questions, questions.*

It’s a tough spot since there’s such a stigma and lack of general understanding regarding testing, results, hell, even the condition itself.

Equivocal,"Hi all, 

I've been dating my boyfriend for around 5 months. He disclosed himself as positive to me before we ever were sexual and when I pressed for more information, said that he was given an igH test after seeing a very small red bump that did not blister on his shaft prior. I forgot the value of this test but it was borderline, essentially equivocal. Two doctors other than the one who administered the IgH said that they didn't think it was herpes. He still went on antivirals, I don't go down on him, and we always use a condom. None of his former partners tested positive for herpes. We waited a while to have sex because I was so anxious. I feel horrible for putting that stigma on him but I couldn't really help it. Honestly, I wish he did not tell me. He recently got a iGG test 8 months after his suspected infection. It was equivocal at 1.06. He had mono at the time his blood was drawn which is a form of herpes virus. The AHA says that this should be considered negative (under 1.1) and his doctor said to use protection like normal but that we're basically in the clear. The anxiety over this has been the number one negative in our relationship. Can we let it go now? The stress is killing me and someone who I love very much. Should he get the western blot?

I am okay with the information that I've gotten about how to take care of myself to prevent outbreaks and I really don't think it should be as stigmatized as it is. But no matter what I think, it is, and I am so scared of trying something with someone, disclosing it, having sex and then them having to go through the same pain I went through.

I have so much fear around seeing anyone new because I know I will have to explain myself AND not only that, I am now scared shitless of any other STD. I feel like I don't want anyone coming close to me ever again.

I am so sad that I am young and I have not really enjoyed a normal and fun dating life because my first time, which I was so excited about and thought was safe, had this as a consequence.

If you've gone through this for a longer time than I have, please share any useful advice or experiences. I'd really appreciate it, thank you so much.",tm48wt,7,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tm48wt/anxiety_a_year_later/,2022-03-24 07:56:36-04:00
First time swingers who caught herpes,"My husband (37m)and I (36f)are both happily married and have been together for 18 years. 
We've been monogamous to one another besides the consensual 3 some on 1 occasion, several several years prior to this event.

We just recently joined the swingers lifestyle; having been acquainted with only female hookups,  we ventured into swapping with other couples.  
We did go into this lifestyle again with a preconceived understanding that we could ""vet"" our couples on how trustworthy their word was when we asked how ""clean"" they've been. Very naive of us. 

We had our first full swap, again without hard evidence of ""clear"" STI panel on Feb 6th.  We met up with them again on Feb 25th again for another full swap. ( all unprotected )

We met another couple and had a full swap, unprotected, on March 6th, 1 week after our last encounter.  Fast forward 5 days later my husband has his first initial GHSV OB. The female half of our last encounter then has a visible OHSV outbreak a couple days later, and after questioning she's had ""cold sores"" for awhile.

My question to you guys, through the countless hours of reading testimonials on here.  How likely is it that my husband picked this up from couple 2 than couple 1.  The time frame from last potential exposure to initial outbreak was 5 days. Can someone with OHSV be contagious a week prior to their own OB and not on daily anti virals?

 I'm not here for anyone's judgment to be casted on us on our lifestyle and we should've known better, I'm here to get opinions and insights from people who have lived through this and are living through this.

I do know the stereotypical statement of it can lay dormant, but it's too coincidental, from us having unprotected sex to the female having cold sores to have come from a dormant virus.

Someone give us some insight please. 

FYI we have proceeded to stop our swinger profile completely and step away from the lifestyle.  This is not something we wish to give by means to anyone else and now a decision we both will live with together.",tmabkt,5,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tmabkt/first_time_swingers_who_caught_herpes/,2022-03-24 09:32:38-04:00
IGG Questions after exposure,"Hi All, hope some of you can help me.  I had protected oral and vaginal sex with a prostitute 2/27.  I also of course like a dummy was kissing this person just so you know the background.  I think I saw something on her lip as well.  I believe a couple days after I got the same looking thing on my lip.  Nothing aggressive looking but a spot on the lip nonetheless.

Just FYI I have had HSV1 since I was very young (so im assuming its Oral).  I was never diagnosed with a swab or anything though.  A couple days after the incident above I was just not feeling myself (extreme fatigue, kind of fog like thinking, blurry vision etc, and I think I also got sick).  The tip of my dick has also been sore on and off since as well.  Also I got a shot of Rocephin on 3/2 and my doc gave me Azithromycin 2000 mg one dose on 3/4 just to be safe.

I was tested for all STDs on 3/2, 3 days after exposure (just positive with HSV1 IGG at 30.80).  Tested 3/16 (tested positive with HSV1 IGG at 30.80 again).  Tested 3/23 and now positive with HSV1 but my HSV1 went up to 32.80.   I just got the results.

I guess my question for all you experts here, are 

1, is 24 days post exposure truly too early to have a decently accurate result for HSV2.

2, The fact that I got the same looking thing on my lip, my worry is she had OHSV2 and transferred it to me thru kissing.  I know its rare, but if she went down on a guy before me with GHSV2, transferred it to her mouth and then kissed me, its possible right?  

3, is the fact my results were 30.80, 30.80, and now 32.80 for HSV1 have any indication on a new HSV2 infection or are they completely unrelated?  

Thanks guys.  Love u all and appreciate your support and answers.",tn7029,1,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tn7029/igg_questions_after_exposure/,2022-03-24 18:13:34-04:00

Daily aciclovir,"Hey 👋 
I have gHsv for almost 7-8 months now.
And I struggle with a lot of non painful and hard to see outbreaks.. 
some blisters disappear in a few days but then I discover new small onces.
I will get on aciclovir daily next week.
I wanna know if you have been in a similar situation and if it helped ? 
Also i wanna know about your experience with aciclovir and transmission to sex partners.

"Trip Advice Please - 25M, OHSV1, GHSV2","Hello All, I’m a 25yo male that was diagnosed with Oral1 and Gen2 in Sept.2021 from and interaction during vacation in Miami July.2021.

I’ve just been so down since, to say the least, that I’ve cancelled or avoided all trips big or small and even local night outs. 

This upcoming trip however the flights are non refundable so I’m using that as an excuse to try to get out and live a little again.

I’ve kept my diagnosis to myself except for a long distance friend and have worked from home majority of the past few months. Only times I go out consistently are to the office or gym. 

But because I’ve had little experience with the virus outside my own bubble, I’ve never had to disclose or prepare for possible intimate interactions. Meaning idk how to disclose or what transmission rates are depending on different acts. 

Im fairly worried for this upcoming trip this weekend will present possible opportunities to be physically intimate again. 

I’ve tried to educate myself but a single google is already extremely convoluted, contradictory and not to mention discouraging and fear generating. 

This group has been my best resource so I’d greatly appreciate just any general advice about preparing for such a trip or for these things in general regardless of location or vacation. 

For example, what if I receive oral sex, what are the transmission rate or implications of the person performing on me? Like is the performer guaranteed to contract? Also, If they perform oral on GHSV2 and then we kiss, will my OHSV1 turn into OHSV2? What’s the transmission rate of me performing oral to a females genitals? Will performing oral flare my OHSV1 and cause a breakout as well? I’m unaware of transmission during inter course as well. 

Apologies if these are dumb questions I’m really not well educated enough on this and that’s probably why I contracted in the first place. 

Huge thanks in advance for any tips big or small about anything. Or even resources.
❤️

Edit: I’m on day 2 of 5 of valacyclovir in anticipation of the trip as well",tn49kb,1,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tn49kb/trip_advice_please_25m_ohsv1_ghsv2/,2022-03-24 16:58:23-04:00
Herpes or something else? (nsfw),"A little over a month ago I had semi-protected sex and felt feverish a few days later. Tongue got extremely sore and swollen along with my tonsils. It was really hard to swallow and function in general but I eventually got better, although I'm still fatigued with some brain fog. A couple weeks later I felt itchy near where my balls meet my thigh and checked under there to see some red pimples developing. No pus but feels like a bad rash is very uncomfortable to work outdoors with when it gets sweaty. Worried it's HSV but could be foliculitis or an ingrown hair or something. Would also mention that the follicles were tender and I pulled a few hairs a couple nights ago but it usually doesn't result in this kind of outbreak...

Adderall and amphetamines I suspect play big role in getting a nastier Herpes outbreak and also more frequent outbreaks.,"I got a great immune system that keeps my HSV1 in check.  The only two times I've had outbreaks was when I went back to taking Adderall again.  I suspect Adderall affects the immune system negatively and Herpes takes advantage of this and outbreaks in a nasty way.  When I had an outbreak before I started Adderall for the first time, it was a small lip cold sore outbreak.  But when I was without any outbreak lip cold sore for 7 months and I took an Adderall pill for the first time, bam I immediately noticed a nasty base of lip cold sore that was larger and more painful than the previous one.

I read somewhere that Amphetamines weaken the immune system and reduce the immune cell count.",tn1egt,1,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tn1egt/adderall_and_amphetamines_i_suspect_play_big_role/,2022-03-24 16:14:24-04:00

Reddit:
If you are uncomfortable reaching me on TikTok or my instagram I can be reached on reddit I have a page dedicated to herpes (it was the first place I posted my story) Mylovelyladylumps6

r/herpes: subreddit is a useful tool to ask questions and connect with others who also have herpes. There are many positive outlooks as well as tips and tricks to dealing with herpes. HOWEVER do tread with caution the subreddit occasionally gets depressing and people do end up wallowing in self pity on there a lot. There are also occasionally posts about how it is unnecessary to disclose to partners which I DO NOT agree with. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/HSVpositive/ is a supportive non judgmental community for people living with herpes (hsv-1 or hsv-2).

https://www.reddit.com/r/HSV_r4r/ this subreddit is for social and dating purposes. It's brand new and worth a shot for people who are fed up with positive singles or not ready to disclose to a non herpes person. It is literally brand spanking new so I have no opinion on it yet but I am hopeful that it will be great. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/HSV_r4r/:  seems to be a place for people with hsv to form connections. Basically a bunch of singles looking. 

r/HerpesCureResearch: this subreddit is dedicated to information about the cure and other herpes research progress. It is extremely interesting however do not fall down the rabbit hole and hyper focus on the cure. There is no telling if the cure will be successful or will work for both types, or even be available to the public right away. It is definitely interesting to look at but sometimes people will sit around and wait to start dating until the cure comes out that that is not the best tactic. 

r/HerpesPersonals & r/Herpes Dating: these subreddits are more for herpes meetups and people looking to date or friends in a similar herpes situation. 

r/HerpesPics: this subreddit is NSFW and is basically a place to post a questionable sore. Whether it's to figure out a diagnosis or if something is a razor bump or an outbreak. WARNING THERE ARE PICTURES OF HERPES HERE. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimsWithHSV/ : A community for Muslims diagnosed with HSV (herpes simplex virus) to be able to connect and find support from fellow Muslims who are also facing the struggle of having this condition. Herpes is not a topic that you can talk to your friends and family about, especially as Muslims. So, it can be incredibly lonely at times. However, this subreddit, proves that you are not alone and is a place where you can find advice and support that you need as well as where you can offer it to others.

Dating Websites:
Positive Singles: this dating APP is catered to people with STIs (mainly herpes, hpv, HIV & AIDS). You can make it as private as you like by not posting anything but a bio until you decide to reveal photos of yourself to another person or you can set it up like a regular dating app. The cool thing about the app is that everyone on there has something so disclosing isn’t nearly as stressful. 
Things I personally did not like:
A lot of the features required you to pay for the app
Anyone from anywhere and any age can message you so it is hard to weed out who you want to talk to 
It seems easy to trauma bond on there if you and the other person were both recently diagnosed (so be careful and don’t settle for anything less than you deserve!)

2. HSV Dating on Facebook: this Facebook group has over 4 thousand members and is not a support group but a way to romantically meet people with hsv. Mission Statement:NOT A SUPPORT GROUP This group is a safe place for those 18+ years old navigating the HSV+ dating world by allowing us to get to know one another in a group setting. This group is all inclusive for all types of dating.May you find what you are looking for in a partner! https://www.facebook.com/groups/358851731762247/?ref=share

3. LGBTQIA 🏳️‍🌈 Herpes Support & Dating Group: This is a private group for members of the HSV/HPV community who identify as LGBTQ. This Group will not appear anywhere on your profile, and only those within the group can see who the members are and what is posted. No new profiles will be accepted. Over 600 members here! https://www.facebook.com/groups/386952082056743/?ref=share

Inoculating myself,"Hi! Have had GSV2 for a year. I know you build up antibodies that makes it unlikely that you will have it both orally and genitally. I have a tendency to bite my lips a lot (until they bleed) and also love giving my boyfriend oral. Am I way more likely to give it to myself orally if I have an open cut on my lips? Or does the antibody thing still apply?


UPDATE FROM TERRI WARREN:

“I’m glad you asked. The cut doesn’t make it more likely that you would acquire HSV 2 orally, no. If you were diagnosed last year, and he is also infected with HSV 2, your infection is well established and if I were you, I would take this off my worry list. If by some rare circumstance, you did acquire this orally, it would look just like a cold sore and likely not recur. Enjoy your sexual relationship and try not to be concerned about this.

Vent sesh,"It’s been about two weeks now since I found out that I was positive for hsv2. I’ve been taking it really well so far and have stayed overall positive. However, a few days ago the depression started to creep up and I’m feeling pretty down about this and how it will affect my life in the future and my future love life.

It really doesn’t help that my giver isn’t giving me the best support throughout this and I know I shouldn’t expect anything from anybody… but maybe a little compassion for giving me something that’s for life would be nice…. We were just starting to get to know each other and I made the mistake of getting too drunk one night and allowing myself to have unprotected sex without asking his sexual history. I have several friends with STIs so I am very adamant about practicing safe sex. 

This whole situation has been really awkward and I’m trying to navigate through it day by day, but he is truly pissing me off with the way he is handling this. If anything I’ve been more supportive of him being devastated that he did this to me. He “didn’t know” his status, so this wasn’t anything intentional. I just feel like I’m comforting him more for his feelings than I’m being comforted for mine and it’s a little annoying. 

I maybe could see a future with us, because he seemed like a great person before all of this, but a part of me also feels like maybe I should hate him for the way he is handling this. Not for doing this to me, but for his lack of effort and compassion. 

We’ve rarely spoken since he came back and confirmed he was positive, which means he was indeed the one who gifted this to me. The few words we’ve exchanged was him saying “I don’t blame you if you hate me forever. I don’t deserve how nice you are. I hate myself for this.” And I’m just over here coddling his a**. It’s actually kind of embarrassing for me to go back and read, because it’s been over a week now and not once has he tried to check in and make sure I’m okay. 

It’s not that I ever need that from him, because regardless I’m going to be okay and fight through this…. But damn I think common sense would be to be here for me. A part of me just wants to block him and not worry about if I ever hear from him again. I just don’t even know.

Lip Filler activates herpes,This is a PSA to anyone thinking of getting lip filler. Don’t do it. I’ve lived my entire life not knowing I had HSV-2 and I got my lips done in October. A week later I’ve had reoccurring outbreaks since then every month that are very painful and give me flu like symptoms. I’ve done so much research and saw that there’s like a 2% chance lip filler can cause herpes reactivation and usually it’s HSV-1 but I think my issues have been traced back to the filler because I never even noticed I had it until then. My life has been changed and I’m hoping once the filler dissolves everything will go back to normal.,tm07cp,5,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tm07cp/lip_filler_activates_herpes/,2022-03-24 03:19:15-04:00

"HSV-1 Confirmed: Only Ever get One Blister, Is this Normal?","Hello!

&#x200B;

So I am HSV-1 confirmed. I contracted it about 6 months ago for the first time. When I got it, I got ONE blister on the inside of my lip. But, it was a major blister, and super painful. It also affected the right half of my tongue, and the right half of my upper gums. My tongue would burn and get inflamed taste buds, and my gums were extremely swollen and burned.  It took a couple weeks to go away and man, the pain.

&#x200B;

Anyway, I'm curious if anyone else experiences HSV-1 this way? From what I've seen, they're usually clustered blisters on the outer edge of the lips. Mine expresses itself as a single blister in the same spot on the inside of my lip. 

&#x200B;

One more thing, I don't feel like I've gotten a break since my original infection. Over the past 6 months it feels like it's only a week and then it tries its best to reappear. I take Valaciclovir whenever I feel a new blister pop up to combat it and it usually prevents it from getting any worse. But dang, any relief? And how can I best help my immune system to build up protection? I'm not sure if how I take the antiviral is effective or could be negatively impacting my ability to build resistance. 

&#x200B;

The guy I’m seeing gave me HSV-2. Is this a good msg to send to him?,"PSA - I don’t feel the need to explain myself to every person on why I believe he is the person who gave me herpes, I have all the info I need to know that it was. That’s not what I’m asking for advice on. 

I’m so nervous about sending a message. I really like him. I’m 99.9% sure it had to be him that gave me HSV-2, I was screened for STI’s before I slept with him, and I have only had sex with him since (unprotected😶). 

FYI - I have only ever slept with him unprotected, I haven’t had sex with anyone else for months. He was having unprotected sex with another person the same time he was sleeping with me, and didn’t tell me. Over a week after I slept with him I started experiencing all the symptoms, sores, fevers, body aches etc. 

Is this a good msg to send to him? 

“So I went to have an STI check and it came back positive for HSV-2 (herpes). I’ve only slept with you since I was last screened, so maybe you should get checked too. I have mild symptoms, you could be asymptomatic, which is maybe why you didn’t know. I’ve done a lot of research and from what I’ve read, it’s actually just more like a rash that comes and goes, shouldn’t impact sex or anything, but the stigma around the STI is the worst part. This isn’t ideal, and It does suck, especially because I’ve never had an STI before. Lowkey freaking out, but I’m hoping we can talk through this, and work it out together. Feel free to take some time, do some research, and let me know how you feel, and what you’re thinking when you’re ready. Hopefully you’d like to talk about this in person on the weekend, I just thought you should know asap”

Should I retest again?,"Slept with girl unprotected who had HSV2 (She didn’t disclose and claims she was asymptomatic) 
Around 40 days after contact I noticed  2/3 bumps in pubic area after shaving, didn’t think anything of it because I just shaved. 

Shaved again 2 weeks after that and noticed the hard bumps turned into red blisters. These “blisters” were not grouped together and scattered throughout pubic region. After like 2 weeks I popped one and only blood came out. Eventually scabbed over and went away. Now I still have 2 of the red bumps after like 35 days that look like they might be starting to scab over. I went to doctor and he said it looks like folliculitis to him. I am unsure tho because he seemed uneducated about herpes. 

To be safe I also got a IGG blood test at 11 weeks (I know 12 weeks is best) and was negative. 

I really feel like I probably have it because these symptoms are probably not just a coincidence after I was exposed to somebody with HSV2. Although, I feel like I’m stuck in limbo. What should my next course of action be? Just wait it out and get another IGG in like a month? Just accept the negative? Hope there’s a reoccurrence and get swabbed?

But I am starting to feel a little interested in someone - and yeah, it's holding me back. Have considered just mentioning it conversationally sometime. I'm not ashamed of it and would like to reduce the stigma and increase awareness. But - I also don't want anyone to pity me, or to become a fixture for gossip. Sometimes when I've talked about it more with friends I've disclosed to, I get the sense that I might overwhelming with stats/info that *I* think they should know, but that they didn't ask for.

Support for Friend/My Anxiety About Herpes,"I have a close friend who has recently disclosed to me that their partner for about a year has herpes. I didn’t ask any details about strain etc as I just wanted to just be supportive of their decision to stay with this person since they knew it was serious and was willing to take the risk. This person is notorious for not using protection and I have made comments about this with other partners but ultimately it’s not up to me to change their behavior. However I do think there’s a self esteem issue at work here. 

A few months have gone by and I have felt a growing anxiety about my exposure to the virus as this friend continually asks to share drinks, vapes and chapstick. We are very close and I feel like putting up this boundary with them will alienate them further and I’m not even sure if they have it! But I’ve been wiping off my vape after I share and making more excuses for sharing drinks etc because I really don’t want to expose myself and not sure if this friend will share the info with me if they find out they too have herpes. 

I’m married and I shared this information with my partner to get some insight and they are very adamant that I stop sharing saliva with this friend no matter how difficult the conversation.

I want to be supportive and caring because I love this friend but I historically am not great at putting up boundaries and am struggling to even imagine the words coming out of my mouth without sounding judgmental. This friend is sensitive and has since ended their relationship with this person and has had another sexual partner since then and hasn’t been tested as far as I know. So I know I can’t really trust her decision-making on this matter. 

While I have so much to say about their choices I know I can only control what I do and say and for me that is telling a friend that for my own comfort I would prefer not to share vapes etc in order to limit the risk for myself and my partner. 

I’ve done a good amount of research and I’d like to avoid flat out asking if this friend has contracted the virus as that is up to them to find out and share with me if they wish. I also know that the likelihood of getting it from them is minimal but still possible when we’re both slobbering over the same vape pen and chapstick.

update 34 yo female HSV2+ Valtrex anyone?,"Last week I wrote about my diagnosis from a bitter and angry mental place. I've since done a lot of reading in this forum, spoken with a friend who has had HSV-2 for 12 years, my friend and ex boyfriend who is a molecular biologist analyzed STD panels for his job and my sister. I'm very lucky to have such a knowledgeable and supportive group of people around me! My friend talked to me about her outbreaks and what it's been like dating with it. She told me to always be upfront with men before any sexual contact and to give them a day to think on it and do their own research before moving forward. She is also a mother of a healthy beautiful girl, which gives me hope for the future.

My ex very patiently listed the statistics around HSV and told me I shouldn't dwell on who gave it to me. He recently contracted HSV1 from his current girlfriend and we laughed a little about the irony. This is a bit controversial and something I need to do more research on, but he told me he didn't want me to take the antiviral every day and only to take it when I felt the tingly of an outbreak. He said it's less effective later in life and I could experience bad side effects from taking it every day. Some context: we broke up years ago, but are still close friends and share a love of hiking, backpacking and caving.

My sister said, what's the big deal? I got HSV1 from the kindergartens kids I work with! More reason to make men respect you and wear protection! 

Lucky me for my support group! ♥️ Not a word about the fact that I used to be a sex worker. Nothing about how I haven't been married or in a relationship longer than six years. They all told me they loved me at the end of our conversation. I'm happy crying! I know I won't get this positive of a reaction from everyone. That's fine and the people who will look down on me aren't the kind of people I want in my life. I can use this as a filter for people who want to be with me for the person I am and keep people out of my life who look for excuses to judge and look down on others.

Just a little rant,"So, a week and a half ago I started getting painful sores, a fever, and many other awful symptoms. Anyways, I decided to go get tested. After the most painful pelvic exam because I was so inflammed and had so many open sores, all the doctor said was it looks like herpes and sent me to go get blood tested for other stds.

Later that day I got a notification from my pharmacy that I had medication to pick up and so I went and got it, it was Valacyclovir so I started taking that based on the pharmasists instructions.

A few days later, I get my results back. Turns out they put my swab in an expired container so they could not perform the test. I got a bunch of negatives on my blood test though. The clinic said I could come back and get a new test with no charge. However, they were out of swabs so I'd have to wait but I couldn't because I was home on spring break from uni.

Anyways, today I went to another clinic to get tested again. I called yesterday and they said they'd just perform a blood test since I'm on medication and my sores are almost all healed. I get in and talk to the doctor. She says that they don't do blood tests for hsv and exained why. She said I'll just have to wait until my next ob and then I'd come in to get a swab done.

I'm so upset because I just want an answer! Right now I'm just assuming I have herpes based on what the first doctor said. And I'm mad at her because all she said to me was ""looks like herpes but we'll see with this swab for sure"" and then sent me to get blood drawn!

Oral HSV1 guidance,"Hi all - 

Does anyone who has gotten oral HSV1 with blisters have any advice on how long the initial outbreaks will last?

"Besides shortenings outbreaks, what is the benefit to taking Valcyclovir or other antivirals?","Hello all,

Recently diagnosed with gHSV-1 via swab. Had my first outbreak about 3ish weeks ago.  Because I was diagnosed about a week into the outbreak, I was prescribed Valcryclovir but didn’t end up taking it because the doctor said it wouldn’t help at that point.  I also read that some people say it’s good to not take antivirals for the first outbreak.

My question is:
Besides helping outbreaks clear faster, is there any benefit to taking antivirals? I understand that if you take it daily it can help eliminate outbreaks all together, but is there a benefit if you’re only taking them during an OB?  Does it help you not have another OB for a longer amount of time?  Just need a rundown on it I guess.  

Super new to all of this, sorry if these are dumb questions.  This sub has helped me a lot.  Thank you all in advance",tlif3c,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tlif3c/besides_shortenings_outbreaks_what_is_the_benefit/,2022-03-23 18:14:15-04:00

HSV-1 on my chin?,"Hi,

So it was a confusing time. I have a history of perioral dermatitis (POD, dermatitis around the mouth, nasolabial folds and chin) and my chin was super red and burning. I assumed it was POD and used my typical creams and antibiotics for it. It got worse, spread, and started to harden. I went to the dermatologist who said it was HSV-1 that got on my chin. Which I thought was weird. I assumed I had HSV-1 since I used to get cold sores all the time but it was on my chin, not on my mouth. It turned into painful blisters, the whole thing.

After a Valtrex prescription, SuperLysine+, tea tree oil, zinc, hypercolloid bandages, it was gone in two weeks. A week after the initial clearing, my chin is red again. I'm so paranoid it's HSV-1 again. Or it could be POD? I'm back to taking Valtrex 1mg 3x a day and Lysine for prevention. Has anyone ever had it on their face like I did? Just so weird. And awful.",tl3vs7,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tl3vs7/hsv1_on_my_chin/,2022-03-23 13:54:12-04:00
OHSV1 transmission never occurred with ex,"So I've been getting more educated about OHSV1 in the last year.

They had never cared and always kissed me and got physical despite me having an outbreak. 

I am still in touch with them and they've told me they have never tested positive for HSV. Could this be a situation where it's dormant or is there another reason?

Nerve Issues,"I (30F) will preface this by saying I have had HSV for 11 years. Contracted at 19 in a traumatic way. Never was tested for what type it was since the doctor told me it didn’t matter. My husband contracted it from me and he goes years in between outbreaks. I have had outbreaks on my genitals, tailbone, in my nose, and cold sores. I have figured out triggers over the years. Stress, masturbating, and it used to be monthly when I was on birth control. 

While my outbreaks have became less frequent over the years they have not become less severe. I have a week of bad nerve pain prior to an outbreak. Most recently I had extreme sharp back pain that was quite brutal and then a cold sore appeared and it went away. I hadn’t thought the back pain was related until it magically disappeared after a week of suffering when this facial growth showed up.  


Looking to know if other people experience HSV at this level and if anyone takes the daily meds that keep it at bay, if they find that to be successful. I’ve always been hesitant to take them in fear that if I ever went off them the outbreaks would get (even) worse somehow.

I think my partner gave me herpes,"My partner and I started dating 9 months ago. We both got tested via blood and urine for full panels including herpes 1 and 2. Both of us came back negative. I also got myself tested again two months into the relationship, because I slept with someone a month and a half before we started dating and I wanted to be sure. This also came back negative. 
A few weeks ago I noticed bumps on my privates, 3 total. It doesn't hurt to pee and they only tingle on occasion. They haven't gone away and don't seem to have burst. But I've never had bumps like this and I am worried it is herpes. I sent off an hpv test and I also have an appointment tomorrow for a swab for herpes. 

Can I get opinions on this timeline, is it likely he cheated or could it be the test he took when we first dated was too soon to when he slept with others (unsure of when he slept with others)? 

I do think it's odd that it's taken til now for me to have an outbreak if he didn't cheat.. 9 months in..

For some context, before the one time I had sex with another guy (1.5 months before dating this one) I did not have sex for three years and got screened multiple times during this period of no sex, to be safe and also because I do have a fear of stds. 

I understand the stigma behind stds but I have extremely low self confidence. It seems there's always something about me for someone not to like.

she has naver told me before that she has herpies. When I became infected, she told me that she had cold sores once in primary/secondary school and she was young back then and had no idea what was that. Her mother has this shit regullary so I guess she knows :/

We are together for 5 months, and she has never mentioned and she has oral herpes

I don't know what to think, for me it just sounds ridiculous. She said it is not that is not a big deal and I don't have to worry about it. It seems for me so selfish or extreamly irresposible and stupid to spread fucking herpes on someone's face

I am worried as fuck. I cannot get rid of this virus and also cannot break up, I am not going to find another girl with this shit on my mouth and I don't want to spread this shit on someone else

I don't know what to do, she is a nice girl who do really care, maybe I am just overreacting? But from my point of view it was completely irresponsible

Today Is my 9th year herpiversary!,"Today is my 29th birthday which officially been 9 years since I got diagnosed with herpes and I wanted to give a life update. When I was diagnosed at 19 two days before my 20th birthday I thought my life was over. I was suicidal and felt absolutely alone and lost. My boyfriend who gave me it dumped me accusing me of cheating, I had no friends and knew NO ONE with herpes. I felt as if my life was over and I would never be loved or have sex again. It took me way to long to grow and learn that I am so much more then my herpes diagnosis. I have had hoe phases, I have had boyfriends I have lived my life. I have healed. I know many of you on this sub are new and scared but I promise it gets better. I promise things turn around. Do not isolate yourself.  The only people your herpes effects are the people you are sleeping With. Friends are supposed to be your support system and if you tell them your story they should not judge you And they will learn from you And your experience. Do not hold yourself back from dating or disclosing. If you let someone you like go because of fear of disclosing you are rejecting yourself without giving them a chance to make a decision. And if anyone rejects you for a skin virus then they aren’t the perfect person for you. Your perfect person will like/love you for your personality, the way you shine not for any physical trait or a minor skin virus that’s not even leathal. As always my dms are open if anyone needs to talk! And I have so many resources in the linktree in my bio, outbreak guides, disclosure guide, herpes facts, all social medias about herpes. And if you have any questions I will always try to find an answer backed by science and facts!!",tk4hpb,52,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tk4hpb/today_is_my_9th_year_herpiversary/,2022-03-22 10:40:16-04:00
Casual Contact Activities… Am I Fine or At Risk?,"Good Morning Everyone!

I hope you’re all doing well. Thank you for the sheer amount of information, love and support that you all provide to strangers that you do not even know.

[updated w/ additional info: my friend left on Tuesday. On Wednesday morning, I woke up with a sore throat that persisted the entire day. On Thursday morning, I woke up with a slightly better sore throat and a slightly more prominent cough and mid/upper back aches. Besides rubbing her back twice and possibly touching the red spots that did not look like blisters, I am confident that I didn’t have any other exposure to her skin long-term that I would categorize as more than you’d get from a coworker.]

In January, my friend was diagnosed with GHSV. I’m not exactly sure if she has Type I or Type II down there, but I’m assuming it’s Type II. Anyway, she is here to visit and she is on her period, something that I know can trigger or cause OBs, or at least asymptomatic shedding, according to what I’ve read here. She takes daily antivirals (not sure exactly which ones, her prescribed dosage or how consistently, but I believe she does take them daily). I just wanted to know how likely transmission is in the below three scenarios. I would never want to make her feel uncomfortable or like our friendship has changed, because honestly, it hasn’t, so I don’t want to ask her and possibly offend her but I would still like to be knowledgeable about things that have stuck out to me and hasn’t left my mind. Considering that it has been less than the 3-4 full months needed for her to form sufficient antibodies and auto-inoculation is higher before this time AND she was on her period so maybe she had increased symptomatic shedding?????):

1. [updated to include] we shared food, and that’s something we’ve always done and I don’t want to say no just because….., but not utensils, so same plate, different forks and spoons. Is this a risk? Could she have somehow passed OHSV2 to me (she’s never mentioned oral symptoms) through this way? She complained of allergies, so maybe her immune system was already low.

2. Earlier in the day, my back was facing her and so I couldn’t see what she was about to do but she adjusted my (low cut, to the point where I had to go without undies) bottom by pulling it up quickly and slightly. To do this, her hand had to go behind the hem of my bottoms and of course, only my skin was there. This area is best describe as the top of my buttcrack/butt. She had used the bathroom earlier/recently and while I trust her to wash her hands thoroughly with soap each time, it’s not like I physically saw it to assume that. How likely would transmission be to this area of my body/me at all from this encounter? I know that the virus can live on hands/fingers if not properly washed and transferred and to healthy skin, it can do no harm but the top of my buttcrack is a different area I’m assuming since it would be considered the start of one of my private areas.


3. I offered to rub cream on my friend’s upper back because she couldn’t reach. She had, in anybody else what I would consider maybe 1-2 small back pimples or non-herpetic red, small spots, but because she has not passed the 3-4 month mark after her initial OB and self (or auto?)- inoculation could happen during this time and I do not know if it did….. How likely is it that those could’ve been herpetic lesions and I could get herpetic whitlow from them? I have INTENSE peeling of my hands from over washing (pandemic + OCD caused). Additionally, how likely would it be for someone else to get it from any virus leftover on my hands if I was holding and caressing this other person’s hand for a good amount of time? This person has new, pink skin over recent cuts and scrapes, but the cuts and scrapes themselves are not new. The scabs have formed and in most, if not all cases, already fallen off and the skin underneath is pink (on it’s way to being fully healed).

I really hope not to offend anybody but like I said, these stuck out to me over the time that she was/is here. Especially now that I have a sore throat, couch and (what really is making me nervous, mid-back aches!!). Thank you for your responses!

TL;DR: Can I get OHSV2 from my friend if we shared food (same plate, different utensils)? She was sick (thought it was allergies but maybe not….) and now my throat is sore and I have a slight cough. She didn’t have any blisters or sores orally.


TL;DR#2: How likely is it for genital herpes to spread from (leftover virus that may be on) one person’s hands to another person if the first person adjusted the waist of the second person’s pants? 

TL;DR #3: How likely is it for genital herpes to cause herpetic whitlow or any other type of infection if Person B rubs Person A’s (with genital herpes) back where there are (could be pimples) small, red spots and has dry, peeling skin from over washing hands in general? How likely is it to cause herpetic whitlow of any other type of infection if Person B holds hands with Person C who has new skin over cuts and scrapes on hand but it is not technically open or fresh?

Again, thank you for your time and if it may seem a little weird, please read the full length of the post for more detail.

Advice needed desperately,"A few years ago I (25f) was seeing this really amazing woman (34f) who lives in a different city to me. We would travel to each other every few weeks and spend the weekend. I liked her a lot, but I was young and couldn’t offer her the commitment she wanted back then. So she got into a relationship with someone else and we fell out of contact for a few years. During this time is when I got herpes (gHSV1).

Anyway, her and her ex broke up recently and she slid in my DM’s again, asking if I want to come visit her. I cant think of anything I want more, but I haven’t replied yet because I know I need to disclose now and I don’t even know how to begin doing it. This will be my very first disclosure, and while I’m not someone who’s been extremely devastated by my diagnosis, I can still understand that someone may not want to expose themselves to that and reject me. Also I haven’t yet had to consider disclosing to someone I actually really like. 

Part of me wants to just never reply so I don’t have to face the inevitable rejection, but that feels cowardly.

So can anyone please guide me on how to best do this? And how to mentally prepare?

Questions I've always wanted to know but no have no one to ask to,"This question is mainly about oral herpes but I'm not sure which type. But yeah would be interesting to know both hsv1&2 

1. Is it possible for herpes not to spread on family members? 

2. If you have never been exposed to anyone with hsv 1&2 before, what are your chances of contracting it?

3. Does the fact that someone has herpes for a long time makes the chances of spreading lower? What if a person still has regular outbreaks? 

4. What are the chances you'd contract the virus after a month of sex but your partner never has an outbreak during the time period?

Just diagnosed: In shock and feeling guilty,"My fiancé and i were having threesomes with this woman for about a month. When she left town, she called us and expressed that she was having the worst pain in her genitals, with blisters, along with a sore throat and fever (I later learned this would be considered her first OB). I immediately got a blood panel, and while waiting for results thought back to if I could potentially have it and not have known. For years I have had ""recurring UTIs"" After reading up on how an OB can be mistaken for UTI symptoms, I knew that the test would come back positive, as it did. 

&#x200B;

My fiancé has accepted it, but I am having the hardest time, and can't get over the ""who, what, when and how's"". At the age of 25, I think I've had it since my sophomore or junior year of college. I will never know if I passed it along to anyone, or who passed it to me. I feel guilty for passing it to the young woman. I'm relieved that I know what is, but a bit envious of those who will probably never get blood work, and will never know they have it. ignorance is absolute bliss. The envy is only there, because I feel really alone right now. I want someone to feel what I am feeling.

&#x200B;

This is absolute ramblings of my initial shock, but I hope I can move forward soon. Wallowing in my sadness will probably elevate my symptoms. I guess the first stage is acceptance, and the next stage is figuring out what triggers an OB for me. If I thought it was recurring UTIs all this time, I'm sure my sores are in my Urethra. I also hope to find something that relaxes me, as I've heard that helps.

Is it important to disclose your status as an HSV1+ person?,"So I have oral herpes type 1. I have a question about when I should disclose and Ill give some background before asking.

I got it as a kid. I don’t even remember how. Probably shared a water cup with an adult who had it. I had some outbreaks back then but I haven’t had an outbreak since, in maybe 15 years, not even when I was extremely stressed or in very harsh and dry weather. Yet my blood test still and forever will come back positive.

Ever since I got diagnosed at age 18 or 19 (before I didn’t know cold sores were herpes), I’ve disclosed it to every person I’ve dated. They’ve always been okay with it or even told me I didn’t have to tell them. And actually none of them have gotten it, and they’ve been multiple year long relationships. So I think the chances I give it to someone are extremely low, I mean despite kissing these girls for years, they never contracted it.

Should I disclose my status to hookups (like one time things)? Should I even disclose it to potential long term partners before kissing for the first time? I think with the latter I should, but I don’t know if I should with the former. I feel like disclosing it would kill any chance of something happening. And oral herpes is SOOO normal and common that it almost feels stupid… but I don’t want to be an ass, or even worst, infect them…

PD: I know I’m lucky. I got it as a kid, and orally, which means I’m very unlikely to get the genital one. I know some of you go through a lot more and my question might feel stupid or even insulting. I’m sorry if that’s the case.

Thoughts on disclosure,"First I would like to preface this by saying I always disclose to anybody I am planning on having sex with. The reason for that is that I believe honesty is the best policy and I would feel guilty if I didn't disclose. 

But anyways....I think the whole expectation on people who know they have herpes is very unfair and doesn't do much besides make us less fuckable. It's also the fact that no one else is doing it but we are expected to because we happen to be educated. I've had 10+ sex partners of both genders and I know for a fact at least one of them had herpes but I was never disclosed to and honestly I don't think I should've been. I never asked if they had herpes so they weren't being dishonest to me even if they knew. Also statistically speaking 80-90% of people with genital herpes have no idea they have it so they are definitey not disclosing that they have it. The CDC doesn't even think it should be disclosed to the vast majority of people with herpes because they do not recommend testing for it unless there is an outbreak. Also nobody asks me ""hey have you ever had any STDs?"" I am the one who has to make that conversation and freak someone out who was seconds ago blissfully unaware that they could get an STD. And then I have to spend time correcting their ignorance. Someone thought I exposed them because we were cuddling with pants on. It's exhausting sometimes. I do think disclosure is important.",tkm7ya,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tkm7ya/thoughts_on_disclosure/,2022-03-23 00:46:24-04:00
Contagious Period with Acyclovir,"Hi all,

I get cold sores on my mouth and take acyclovir pills to stop the cold sore from progressing. This usually stops the cold sore completely so the skin remains normal or significantly minimizes it so the skin heals in less than a week.

Everything I've read online says 15 days is the contagious period but seems to assume with no treatment is used; these articles also generally say when all scabs are gone, then your in the clear.

Im wondering what the scientific understanding is for the contagious period when medication is taken. Since my skin is normal after, let's say, 5 days and any tingling has gone away,  am I no longer contagious or is viral shedding still occurring?

From now on, with lovers and clients alike, I want to do everything in my power to protect myself from exposures.

Seeing that I have a higher chance of contracting HSV1 and 2 than the average person, I wanted to know what I could do in addition to using condoms to lower my risk. Using lube to prevent friction rips in condoms and maybe even wearing crotchless pants to cover vulnerable areas while I work seems smart.

What was your first outbreak of oral herpes like?,"For context: I’m a college student who recently started feeling a faint tingling sensation on my lip. I also have started developing a canker sore within my mouth that is positioned under the tingling area of my lip. I understand that canker sores are not related to herpes, however the tingling of my lip is considered a pre-symptom of the viruses. I asked my question so that some of you could possibly help me navigate whether or not I’m looking at a possible herpes infection. Also I know herpes is fairly common, so there isn’t a stigma I’m afraid of; however, I do have a partner, so I would like some clarity on the tingling. It’s also important to note that I have no fever or any of the accompanying symptoms of a first outbreak, but I do know herpes affects each person differently. I apologize in advance is any of this comes off offensively, I just want to make sure I’m being responsible with my partner.",tkbe8b,2,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tkbe8b/what_was_your_first_outbreak_of_oral_herpes_like/,2022-03-22 15:48:53-04:00

Outbreak duration,"Hey guys, I basically have been wondering how long this OB will be, and I just have some questions.

Is it cool if I continue removing the crust? Do I continue taking valacyclovir and applying abbreva? How long should I continue doing so?

I don’t think it’s worth knowing.,"I think we should all consider why the CDC recommends not testing if you don’t have very visible symptoms. 

I personally am not entirely sure if I have it or not. And it’s been definitely destroying my state of mind. I can either find out for sure. End up having it. And risk the chance of falling into a deeper depression and taking my life if it gets that dark. 

Or I can treat live life like it was 100 years ago. and not hyper focus on every little body ailment. We live in a time where we can get on our little internet devices and hyper focus to such an unhealthy degree on potential health issues. I’ve probably spent 20+ hours in the last 2 months reading endlessly. The same damn posts over and over again. For what ?!!!   A virus that 80-90% of people are asymptomatic with. 

I barely have sex. But if I find my self really liking someone. And I end up giving it to them. Well then I guess we’re meant to be at that point. But fuck. I can’t live my life hyper focusing. I want to be more carefree. And not treat my life like I live in a fuckin plastic bubble. And share my every little health record with everyone I meet. 

A lot of you make no progress in feeling better because Reddit and the internet becomes a stupid echo chamber of self pity. Im so fucking done with it. Many of us live in a time and place where life is too fucking comfortable. And it gives us way too much opportunity to be emotionally weak. And obsessed with dumb shit like this. 

Reddit is full of people like this. I’m so tired of it.
This is what happens when a society hyper focused on safety and security. People go fucking crazy. And the biggest threat to their safety is their own damn mind.  And this is why the cdc says to just not even test for it. It does more harm than good. 

I want nothing to do with it. I’m going to learn to have fun again. 


So I’d rather not know. I’m taking the CDCs guidelines. They are the authority on this.",tjrr9n,47,109,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tjrr9n/i_dont_think_its_worth_knowing/,2022-03-21 21:39:08-04:00

Ps. I haven’t told my parents because I don’t want to, my mom is wonderful and she is just trying to make sure I’m ok so please no shade about that, I just want to know if my results will be on the bill.

Just wondering if this at all sounds like herpes (20M)…,"I had protected sex with a new partner a little over 2 months ago and 19 days after I started having some symptoms. I had a pretty bad tingling for around a week and a half, I was incessantly checking the spot and noticed some white dots on my penis, no pain just noticed them. I was icing and putting warm packs over my penis area during this as well. Around 2 weeks later I went to the doctor and they said I have a yeast infection and gave me clotrimazole to treat it. 

I still had some doubt but I would treat it as such, the white dots are still there over a month later with no change, however I started to have another tingling in my groin a couple weeks ago (7 weeks after sex) and started to put the clotrimazole on this area, the tingling quickly turned into a burning but still no sores or any blisters. Went to another doctor and they said I had jock itch but the spot where it burned wasn’t super red but I still put the clotrimazole for another week and the burning was on and off. I was still worried so I got a full std panel and came up negative for everything (including igg and igm even though it was only 8 weeks since potential exposure).

I am now having another tingling feeling on my inner thigh but haven’t seen any blisters or anything to suggest an outbreak. Could this be a reaction to the clotrimazole? (the doctor recommended I stopped using it yesterday). Is it possible to have all these symptoms without any sores? My symptoms are on and off, could it also be anxiety related? I’ve never really been super focused on the feelings down there before now so it may be nothing. Just any change in feeling or look down there and I get anxiety about it.

My doctor also suggested I don’t need another test as the evidence is pretty clear. Any thoughts or has someone experienced something similar?",tk8b1j,2,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tk8b1j/just_wondering_if_this_at_all_sounds_like_herpes/,2022-03-22 13:31:53-04:00

Herpes sore vs Ingrown hair,"Hey y’all

I was diagnosed with GHSV-1 in August of last year, got it from my ex partner who has OHSV-1. I had a pretty nasty initial OB because I got covid right after and since then I have had 2 more (what I think were) OBs. When I say I think they were OBs, I mean I felt some nerve pain in my leg/groin area and immediately took antivirals to prevent any other symptoms so I have never had an OB with sores present except for my initial one.

A couple days ago I had a singular bump appear on my pubic area and I am having a tough time determining whether it’s a sore or just an ingrown hair. It was very slightly sensitive to the touch but now doesn’t feel like anything. Any advice on how to tell the difference? I’ve taken some anti virals anyway as a precaution but it’s looking more like an ingrown to me at this point.

I need advice.," I (26m) have been in a long term MF relationship for 5 years now. I’m healthy, extremely active, no major conditions. 

I’ve developed tingles, sore lymph nodes and ultimately a small blister patch at the base of my peen on a couple of occasions. Nothing extreme. They’re sore, and do not go away with steroid ointments. I am 99.9% sure it’s GSHV. I cannot ignore it any longer as much as I want to. No apparent symptoms with my partner that I know of. We’ve never had sex whilst I’ve had symptoms. 

I am so unbelievably scared of approaching this because I don’t know how it’s going to go. I’ve never been unfaithful and I don’t think she has either.

I think I know what I need to do, and go get a swab done. I’m uncomfortable going and getting secret tests done but don’t want to have the talk unless I’m sure. I’m also terrified it may have come from her or I’ve given it to her.

First oral HSV outbreak treatment advice,"Further to my last post, thus far I have developed no sign of genital herpes, though I have contracted it orally. Noticed coldsores on the inside of my lip this morning. I've been horribly ill the last few days with fever, muscle weakness, light-headedness, incredibly sore and swollen gums to the point eating and drinking is really hard, bleeding gums, a really sore throat, and a near constant headache. The doctor thought it was an infection in my wisdom teeth so I've been on metronidazole, but I now know all these symptoms align with an oral outbreak.

Now that I know I'm hsv positive I have some questions:

1. How can I treat my symptoms, other than with painkillers?
2. Is it worth getting the sores swabbed to find out if it's type 1 or 2?
3. Does the fact I contracted it orally mean that I'm unlikely to develop it on my genitals too from the same exposure?
4. Going forward, are there antivirals or any other meds I can take to prevent shedding, and can I get these free from the clinic? (UK based)

Eventually I was injured at work. she left me for greener grass.  As she said no future. 23 years later I am alone.  I refuse to be the monster my ex was.  I disclose every time.

So I had the talk and he was so accepting. He asked good questions and seemed concerned for my well-being overall. I guess I was getting all worked up talking about it, he takes my hand, says “Stay calm. Everything’s going to be ok. I’d be too devastated to lose you now over this.

Disclosed to my partner and now we’re broken up he wants to use it against me,"I was with my ex for two years. Before we had sex I disclosed to him I had HSV-2 he said he didn’t care he loved me and I was the one and that he didn’t care if he got it. I was on the medication for a little bit but then stopped because he kept saying he didn’t care. He contracted it and didn’t care but now that we’re broken up he’s trying to use it against me saying how I’m the awful one for giving it to him and he has it for life now (we broke up because he was abusive and cheated on me) and threatened to sue me. I’m incredibly hurt because I thought I did all the right things and gave him my trust and now I might be getting sued. Can he even do this if he consented?

Confused about igg vs. Igm testing,"Hi all,

I’m a bit confused about these testings for antibodies. Can they only tell if you have herpes/ what strain… but neither can tell if it’s oral or genital? Is the swab test different? I got diagnosed with genital hsv1 but I’m a bit confused how they even determined this. They took a swab of my outbreak (about 3-4 days after getting symptoms)… does the swab do both igg and igm testing or is this only from blood and the swab test is different? If I tested positive for hsv1 antibodies, other than having a physical outbreak, how would they tell if it’s oral or genital?",tjvl7t,2,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tjvl7t/confused_about_igg_vs_igm_testing/,2022-03-22 01:17:31-04:00

Feeling low…,"I’ve had Herpes (HSV2) for 7 years and I recently discovered positive singles. I met someone on there who has (HSV1) genitally. We talked for a few days and discussed how we feel limited with who to date because it’s easier to meet someone who has herpes than to disclose with someone who doesn’t. We went bowling and he invited me back to his place and I ended up giving him a handjob after he made it clear that we weren’t going to have sex. I was okay with that because i didn’t want to rush into sex.

The next day he said he was tempted to have sex with me but he doesn’t just have sex with anyone. I felt the same so I told him that it will happen when it happens but I don’t want it to just be about sex with us I’d actually like to get to know you. He said “no I’m good, we had a good time and that was all, god bless you”. I felt so low and rejected like geez we can’t even be friends? I feel like because he met me on there he just took me for a hoe or like I have a bunch of STDs when i literally have the same one just a different strain.

I don’t even like dating apps and I already felt super low having to use that app but also hopeful because I could meet someone with my condition.

Confusing IgG parameter after testing.,"Decided to have a full panel done after my last boyfriend. I [31F] did not know his status, but we used condoms every single time. We dated less than a month, but I know that doesn’t matter.  The last time we had sex was February 21st, and I just got my results back this morning after testing last week. 

I’m aware that the blood test is often unreliable, but after seeing a bump on my labia last week, I wanted to get some labs done. My screening was done by Labcorp and read:

HSV1 Negative > .91
HSV2 Negative > .91

Index was .90 for each strain.

Their equivocal range starts at 0.91, so I’m riiight on that grey area border. The little sore on my labia has since disappeared, but being so close to the equivocal range still makes me believe that I’ve been exposed and it may have been too early for antigens to build. 

I have an appointment with my gyno on April 26th, so I plan to retest then, but based off the info above, am I reading things right?

I just watched a commercial for a daily medication for HIV that causes patients to have undetectable levels of the virus. Why haven’t we gotten there (functional cure) with HSV?

The effects of HSV on patients causes/can cause a serious decline in quality of life in a multitude of ways.

Another is it HSV thread?,"I read tons in this community! Lots of helpful people here! I'm going to go by the rules guidelines. In asking my questions

 

* **What part of the body is involved? Mouth area, genital area, or some other area?**

Lip Line

* Where are your symptoms located *within* the above area?

Yup! 

* **What do your symptoms** ***look like?*** **Eg blisters, bumps, pimples, cuts, ulcers/lesions, a rash, chafing, etc? If blisters/bumps, how many are there? How big are they? If a rash, how big an area does it cover?**

It was ..weird, I came home from work and talking with my roommates, and then proceeded to adjust my mustache as all beard people do! Then felt something kinda bumpy. I check the mirror and It was a MASSIVE White head it seemed, alongside another tiny white head next to it. I SHOULD have taken a picture , I'm annoyed I didn't, I panicked and popped them but got distracted by someone calling my name I didn't even see what came out, I know, I got NOTHING for you guys to work on.

* **Do bumps appear to be solid or have liquid inside? If any liquid has come out, what color is it and what consistency does it have?**

I actually didn't get to see what came out, but I barely touched it and they popped. They left 2 tiny holes and scabbed within hours.

* **Are any physical sensations associated with your symptoms? Do they hurt or itch? Do they have any sensation when you are not touching them? What about when they are touched or rubbed?**

No sensations , no itching, no burning, nada. If I touch them I feel something, but nothing you wouldn't already experience messing with a pimple.

* **How long have your symptoms been there?**

I guess I've been monitoring it for 3 days?

* **Have they changed at all since they first appeared? If so, how?**

Scab, then fell off in the shower, this was roughly 2-3 days total.

* **Are you experiencing any other symptoms in addition to the visible ones on your mouth/genitals? Eg headache, fever, body aches, tingling sensation on the skin, etc? Do** ***not*** **just say that you have ""flu symptoms"" or ""flu-like symptoms"". Tell us the** ***specific symptoms*** **you mean by that.**

Nah, had canker sores, but I know HSV and they aren't related .

Please include any other information you think might be relevant.

The day after where one head, (I hope is a pimple) scabbed, I went nuts and squeezed it hard, and had clear oil come out. Made the area sting for a bit , then scabbed and I left it alone. Came off in the shower last night. 

I've always been sexually active, especially orally both up and down stairs of all sexes. So the idea of having HSV1 isn't really mind blowing, but since I have a partner of 5 years , If HSV decided to show it's face in my 30's then I wanna be safe. I would have gone to the doctor to swab, but there really isn't anything to swab..which makes me think it isn't HSV. 

TLDR Giraffe!

Got 2 BIG heads, they looked white/yellow . Didn't see what came out, because I was panicked. They scabbed after a day, I squeezed and pissed off one, oil came out it seems. No Tingling burning etc. Been checking pretty much every couple hours to see if there is any changes. Just seems like it's two normal pimples healing, but again I COULD BE WRONG! HSV 1 or 2, pictures are so frustrating to google! 

Are there any CLEAR ""yeah this is HSV"" or ""Yeah thats a pimple""

I've had 2 different partners in the past few months, and that's after having been married for a decade and being monogamous that entire time. I was finally able to see a new OBGYN, and got some swab and blood testing done.

Everything came back negative, including the swab testing, with the exception of HSV IgM. The result was 1.45, so a positive result, but I have zero symptoms and - like I mentioned - swab test came back negative. The HSV 1 and 2 IGG results are both ""non-reactive"". I do have a yeast infection, but that's resolving with standard OTC cream treatment.

I should say that I've never had cold sores, but I did have a gnarly round of chicken pox when I was a kid and shingles in my 20's.

I think I may have herpes aka my fiancé is cheating on me,"I am extremely worried I have herpes. I have been in a committed, 4 year relationship with my fiancé. In the 4 years I’ve dated I have never had an issue like this. 

Last Thursday I was rushing and wanted to shave a little bit down there. I used an old electric shaver we have and quickly ran it over two specific areas. I know it was sloppy and I felt it catch a few times but I ignored it. That area is very high friction for me and because of that, I have multiple skin tags (which were tested by my gyno) down there. So I know I cut some of them. I stupidly then put on bike shorts and immediately worked out for about an hour.

A few hours later I noticed that the area where I shaved had big, fleshy, red lumps with what looked like a cut/opening in the middle. It looks like some of them are cut/irritated skin tags, and I know I accidentally shaved one off. Since then, they’ve calmed down and gotten smaller but some have formed tiny blisters and others look like open but healing sores. Like flat and white in the center. They look very similar to a lot of herpes pictures I’ve seen. 

I’m terrified that my fiancé cheated. I want to believe he hasn’t, since we both work from home and since the pandemic started we’ve been together almost the entire time since then save for small periods.

Fast forward two days and I’ve now begun to feel a slight stinging/irritation just under the head of my penis. There is a single circular like patch of skin that appears to be shiny at the source of the irritation. The irritation at this point is slight but consistent now that I’ve realized it. I’m hoping I’m just in my own head.

I should caveat that I had also masturbated an aggressive amount over the weekend so my hope is that I just irrated my skin and potentially rubbed a part raw.

I haven’t seen any other symptoms besides this up to this point but am very nervous if I’m experiencing a first breakout either through this altercation, if I did receive oral with out a condom and I just don’t remember it. I was also told by an ex girlfriend over a year ago she was diagnosed hsv1 positive during a time we hooked up when we were not using a condom. I took at blood test then 3 weeks after expose and was told I was negative.

Day 9,"Good morning, I’m on day 9 after unprotected sex. Tingle is still here, comes and goes.

I’ve been lethargic but I think it’s due to being in my head. I urinate still pretty frequently. Lower back a bit tender, again could be due to the cocktail of drugs I’ve taken.

The tingling, the tender groin (v-cut), the lower back tenderness, and slightly itchy thighs are all things I’ve read in the testimonies of hsv2 positive individuals….

What are the blisters like?,"I either had folliculitis or herpes on the scrotum and was not able to get in for a swab so I’m kinda stuck in limbo waiting for a potential blood test down the road. My bumps were a combination of raised white pustules and deep, quite large firm bumps that seemed to be deeper in the skin, all in the same area, all filled with a thick white green pus. None of the bumps were touching each other. The timing for herpes and folliculitis both lines up, as I had shaved AND had protected sex about 28 hours prior. I’ll admit the shaving was somewhat aggressive. The raised white bumps had hairs poking out the top but granted it was a hairy area. The bumps were pretty firm, and the subsequent sores actually would refill with the same pus, grow new skin over, and I’d actually have to “re-pop” them to get that second batch of pus out. The affected area was bothered by friction and pressure but didn’t really ache on its own. It’s been 6 weeks and I still have redness and dark spots left over. I am gonna eventually get a test but limbo ain’t fun so if anyone has any stories, advice, or anything it’d be seriously appreciated.",tjljkv,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tjljkv/what_are_the_blisters_like/,2022-03-21 16:44:12-04:00
"Getting very obsessive, anyone else?","Hey all,

Had my first gHSV1 outbreak about 3 weeks ago (male), and I think I’m pretty much all over it now.  Still feel a bit sensitive under my foreskin but is that to be expected?

I’ve become very obsessive about washing my hands/touching my penis, to a point where it’s become a bit of an issue.  I’ve got this mental thing now that like whenever I touch my penis it’s like I’m touching poison, that I’ll be spreading it or something.  I don’t even have any active sores atm but I just can’t shake this mental thing.  It’s gotten to a point where my hands are getting super dry due to the over washing.

Has anyone else dealt with this? TIA",tjfo93,2,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tjfo93/getting_very_obsessive_anyone_else/,2022-03-21 12:24:38-04:00
I really need advice,"
I dated someone with hsv 1 orally and genitally briefly for five months in 2021. I now have suspicions that he may have had hsv 2 as well. He showed me his test results when we first began dating and it said he had an index of 57 for hsv 1 and 0.90 for hsv 2. I’m aware that 0.90 is usually seen as equivocal however different labs have different standards for testing and beside the number is said negative. My only concern is that he said he contracted it in September of 2020 and tested in February 2021 and his antibodies were already at 57 for hsv 1 that’s why I believe he contracted a hsv 2 infection instead. Is it possible that his antibodies could be so high in such a short period of time? When we were together we never had penetrative sex we just kissed and he only gave me oral once. What is the possibility that I now have it? He was taking medication as well. I’ve never seen any sores or anything but I know the virus can lay dormant. I’ve tried to be tested three times and twice the test were mixed up by the doctor and the last time the doctor I seen refused to get the test done. Is it worth being tested for? I’m honestly a nervous wreck because of this situation my ex and I have been broken up for ten months now and I want to start dating but Everytime I just start thinking about what if I accidentally give someone herpes. If I get tested and it is positive for hsv 1 should I assume I have it both orally and genitally because he gave me oral sex or just assume I have an oral infection. Someone please give me honest feedback because I am incredibly stressed and worried about this situation. I don’t wanna accidentally give someone herpes but I also don’t feel like I need to put myself through the mental stress of being tested when doctors don’t even recommend it",tjpoet,0,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tjpoet/i_really_need_advice/,2022-03-21 19:54:23-04:00

"Please help, I’m so confused…","Sorry, This is extremely long but please read to fully understand.. 

So, to start, I was with my partner for 2 years and we broke up. We didn’t have sex for 3 months at least prior to the break up..after breaking up with him, I went back to my child’s father and we slept together (roughly) - fast forward 8 days, I started noticing bumps. My vagina was obviously torn from the roughness of the sex, but these bumps were not blisters and were not located in the inner area where the tears were. Plus, They never burst, never caused me any pain other than when i wiped at them and kind of palpated them to see what they were. They were around my clitoral/outer labial area and nowhere near the inner labia or vulva. I went in to get “swabbed” because I popped what looked an ingrown hair and thought maybe it could be swabbed anyway. 7 days later, I get a positive IGG for herpes 1 and 2, index 1.5 for hsv2 and 1.1 for hsv1. The swab was negative. Tell child’s dad about this because I thought he gave it to me. He tested negative for hsv1&2 a week later. So now, I’m thinking wtf?, my ex boyfriend gave it to me?? He has not been tested and won’t because he hasn’t had any symptoms, which pisses me off. 

Anyway, this “outbreak” lasted all of 5 days MAX. Like the symptoms were over before I tested positive. and never ONCE did I experience a popped blister or painful urination in the vaginal area other than the first couple days after the rough sex due to tearing. I was prescribed Valtrex and when I tell you I reacted BADLY. SEVERE Back spasms, nausea and vomiting, horrible vertigo, etc. as soon as I stopped taking them at the end of the script, I stopped reacting.

So, I go get tested again, this is about the 3 week mark since the “outbreak”. This time I asked for another swab, a second IGG, and my doctor threw in a blood PCR test which I hear is useless, but whatever. PCR and swab came back negative, but IGG came back positive for hsv2, index 1.2 and hsv1 was equivocal right at 0.9 - weird, right?? 

So NOW, fast forward to a couple days ago I was ending  my period and those bumps appeared again, with itching and yeasty discharge. So I do a telehealth visit and they prescribe me yeast infection pill and Valtrex for 6 days worth. The bumps disappeared after I started the yeast pill but I am still taking the Valtrex just to be safe. I am so sick from it, it makes me wonder wtf I am even taking it for. 

So sorry for the long post, but WHAT THE HELL is going on? My doctor is not giving me any answers except “you definitely have a herpesvirus, but not sure what type/location, and just disclose to people you might have it.” MIGHT? Is there not a damn YES OR NO? Like what do I do??? Someone please help my mental health is suffering because I just want to know what is going on, I know the stigma against the virus is ridiculous and it’s more common than we know, I’m not worried about that. I just wanna know what I should be disclosing and more importantly where the hell did I pick this up if my last sexual partner tested negative, and the one before that was 3 months ago with no outbreak until January and a low positive???

Chin HSV2 with a little panic,"So I'm sitting here working and my chin starts to itch. I have a beard and sometimes that happens so whatever. I scratch it. It just gets worse so I go check it out... 

A bunch of little clear blisters. 

Wtf. I have had HSV2 genital only for a couple years and this is new... 

What worries me is I rested my chin on my toddlers head multiple times this past week and gave them kisses, 2 or so days ago they put my beard comb in their mouth, and i put eye drops in their eyes all day yesterday and I wasnt being mindful and washing my hands every 5 seconds as I typically do. 

I take daily suppressants but we were sick all weekend and now I'm reeling going through every moment to see if there is any possibility I spread this to them, weighing probability, determining odds if it was there but no blisters yet. 

Fuck this virus man 

Edit from my crosspost: 

I'll obviously know if they get it within a few days but to help ease my mind until then does anyone have any resources on lesion development time or transmissibility? 

I started getting a sore throat yesterday so I assume I at least had a small red patch there. 

Super sore throat and blisters today. 

They put my beard comb in their mouth for half a second before I snagged it on Friday although I don't think I had used it any time right before they did that. 

I did give them forhead kisses yesterday and we snuggled all day Saturday with some chin resting on their hair. 

I put eye drops in their eyes all day yesterday so i'm hoping I wasn't scratching my chin with the hand that touched their eyes but I don't think there were blisters yet otherwise it would have been as itchy as it is right now.",tjetb1,2,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tjetb1/chin_hsv2_with_a_little_panic/,2022-03-21 11:47:11-04:00
Fucked myself (M28) for life,"I'm not sure, maybe I should've posted this to r/vent, but I thought the people here might have some truthful insight. This weekend I had a bit too much to drink and willingly had sex with a GHSV-2 positive woman. She properly warned me and I still did it, without proper protection. This was maybe the second time I've met her, and I risked it all for one night. I've got pretty much all the prodrome symptoms, and I'm going to the doctor today. I understand how you would cope if getting herpes was something that happened by accident, but I did this to myself. I feel like a complete idiot, and can't get over the fact that I did this to myself. I have myself and only myself to blame. I guess I'm just curious if anyone had a similar situation, and how to cope, because I feel like a total piece of shit who fucked up the rest of their life for some mediocre sex.

Edit: it's been about a week since contact, still some burning/tingling between thighs, doctor said it doesn't look like herpes, but it's early. Blood test came back negative, but that was expected for how early it is. How long will it take to know for sure if I have it?

2nd outbreak in 30 days?,"Hi all. I had unprotected sex feb 15 with someone I was intimate with in the past, also unprotected, and was seen in the hospital feb 19 for what I thought was only MRSA on my leg and really painful (lower abdomen abs back pain) BV. I did also develop flu like symptoms and extreme muscle stiffness and weakness around the 17th of the month. When I went to the hospital I did have two bumps (looked like possible ingrown or MRSA) on my vulva and requested an std panel. The panel came back positive for BV, mGen, and although the doctor said my bumps did not look like herpes I had a white kind of mucousy discharge and so she gave me valacyclovir to be safe. I’ve finished all of the antibiotics and antiviral 5 days ago and now I have the white mucous type discharge and tingling on my vulva along with this time a few small bumps. I WANT TO ADD THAT I HAD A HERPES BLOOD TEST IN JANUARY AND IT WAS NEGATIVE. so that is why I am a little confused as to what to really think of these symptoms I’m having because I would think if he’s had it and I’ve slept with him in the past wouldn’t my test have been positive? I wanted to wait until the first week of April to go back to the doctor for a follow up or TOC swab for the mgen and blood test for herpes but would it make more sense to get the herpes blood test done now while I might be having a possible outbreak?  I did also buy new underwear and feel like it has been constantly pulling at my hair down there, but I don’t want to be ignorant to the fact that I am feeling tingling. I will try to attach a photo.

Recurrent gHSV-1 symptoms,"I first began having HSV breakouts over two years ago (maybe more like 10 years ago, it's hard to say). After dating a new person for a bit I started to have them regularly. It was a toxic relationship and it messed up my sleep so I blamed that. Since then I've been having regular breakouts and was assuming it was HSV-2 for that reason. The igg blood test showed positive for HSV-1 (50 igg) and negative for HSV-2. So I can be assured that it is HSV-1 I think, but I'm surprised I'm having such regular breakouts every 3-4 months.

I'm taking valtrex regularly and the symptoms are very small these days. I also take lysine and other multivitamins and I'm otherwise very healthy.

"I'm worried our ""safe"" spaces are for fetishizing our own sadness and feeding into the stigma","This is a little bit of a rant but sometimes if ""herpes positive""(no pun intended) spaces like this subreddit and PositiveSingles and others are healthy or if we're just feeding into the stigma and isolating ourselves. We have internalized the idea that carrying this very common and *for the most part* benign virus makes us unloveable contagious freaks and we withdraw into ourselves. I question the usefulness of these spaces for depressed newly diagnosed folk when almost everybody else is lamenting and catastrophizing their condition. Instead of supporting and educating each other alot of times we are validating each others shame and inadvertently justifying the extremely overblown stigma placed on us. Don't get me wrong, I have learned alot and have benefitted immensely from this subreddit and other herpes communities but I think we should be careful about if what we are saying is productive or if we're fetishizing our own stigma and status. We are the ones who have to live with this virus we should be cultivating a space based on supporting, educating each other, debunking the stigma, and living a fulfilling life full of love and happiness. Maybe I am being insensitive and I strongly dislike toxic positivity we should be able to understand each other's sadness and providing solutions instead of feeding into it. These are just my thoughts.

Quick Question about The Herp,"hi guys, I have a quick question about herpes, specifically HSV-1, as I haven't been able to find answers online.

As we all know, HSV-1 is also referred to as cold sores when we have it in the mouth. Curious about this scenario:

If I have HSV-1 but asymptomatic  and I kiss someone, this means that I am still likely to pass it to them, correct?

From my understanding of herpes, both HSV-1 and HSV-2 generally prefer ONE area of the body. So for instance if first point of contact is this one particular area (either mouth or genitals), the virus reoccurs in that particular body part only. Correct?

So, let's say I've passed it to them via mouth to mouth - this means the virus has been exposed to that specific area, therefore meaning that the body has already started building antibodies for the virus. Which means that if first point of contact is the mouth, they are not or less likely to get it on the genitals...? am I correct to say this?

This is taking into account gap in time between kissing and performing oral sex on partner, about a week or two.

In summary, my question is basically this:

I have HSV-1 but asymptomatic. Kissing partner on one occasion will have exposed them to the virus in the mouth and given body time to create antibodies. Does that mean that my partner would have developed a resistance towards the virus in the genitals (meaning they don't have HSV-1 in the genitals, just the mouth).

Is there a correlation between the when you contracted HSV and your chances of passing it on?,I’ve had HSV2 since I was about 18. So that was about 10 years ago. I rarely have any outbreaks but I don’t take anything for it. I want to know if anyone has any info on whether or not you’re as likely to pass it on after years of having it compared to just contracting it? Like will my chances of infecting decrease since I’ve had it for so long.

Reoccurring outbreak,Hiiii f(22) here. I was diagnosed in 2018 and haven’t had an outbreak in almost 3 years but this one is PAINFULLLL. I have 5 clusters on my vulva leading to my perianal. I’ve never had clusters in my perianal and they hurt so freaking bad. Has anyone had outbreaks in that area and know how to deal with it? The area is super red and inflamed. I’m super scared that I have a perianal abscess caused by hsv and will have to get it drained or something. Its only been day two but I’ve NEVER had an outbreak this bad and it feels like the first time again. Im sad because everyone always talks about how reoccurring outbreaks are less severe but this one is horrible :(,tizrpe,5,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tizrpe/reoccurring_outbreak/,2022-03-20 21:05:02-04:00

happy 1 year herpiversary,"Tonight will be the one year of my herpes diagnosis. I would admit myself to the ER because I was having chills and I would see blood in my toilet. This lasted for days until I finally decided to go. 

I had a two week long OB, calling out of work sick because I couldn’t relieve myself without screaming and crying from the pain. 

It’s been a wild ride. 

I’ve learned a few things. 

- it doesn’t affect your relationships much. I’ve had two boyfriends since my diagnosis, and they’ve accepted me. 

- it is crucial to work on your self love.

- it’s a blessing and a curse. If someone turns you away because of your diagnosis, good riddance. Know your worth. You are much more than the stigma. 

- take your valtrex - I pop it occasionally when I’m sexually active & it helps relieve some of the anxiety if I feel any prodromal symptoms.

- a lot of people have it. Like, a lot. I know the data says so, but it’s different when you disclose and they say “oh! I have that too” or “yeah! Someone else I know has it” it really helped put it into perspective for me. 

- I have recently stopped participating in hookup culture. sleeping with a stranger after disclosing sends me into a whirlwind of anxiety. Even if I haven’t had an OB in ages and I take my meds. Can’t do it. Nope. I’m good. 

- life goes on, it’ll be okay. Take care of yourself. Know your triggers, take your valtrex and disclose.",tio6ot,13,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tio6ot/happy_1_year_herpiversary/,2022-03-20 12:00:28-04:00

Recently my long term relationship ended and I abruptly stopped taking Valtrex as I no longer had to worry about protecting someone I care for.

My intention would be to return to taking my Valtrex should I find myself in a more serious relationship again at some point.

How many people have actually disclosed to you?,"I (27M) have been pretty sexually active my whole adult life. I've now only recently (since learning I have HSV2) been more quiet on that front.

That would go against the statistics massively, so obviously none of these girls would have disclosed or intended to. It's bullshit because I feel so awful now and so anxious about disclosing all the time so as not to have anyone else feel like this. Surely a handful of those women had to have known.

If you think it’s herpes...,"If you think you have herpes don’t waste your time stumbling through Reddit and google trying to self diagnose or dig in to your denial.

If you have sores then get a live culture test + blood work to be sure. Blood work tests for antibodies. If you don’t have the sores at the time of the appointment get the blood work.

I pop onto this sub occasionally and I see so many posts from newly-diagnosed people in sheer panic and distress. It's totally valid. I was the same way. I kept googling and googling before my doctor's appointment. I kept retracing my steps. I kept reading horror stories. I kept examining in the mirror. I kept scouring the internet for every scientific fact I could find. It was so panicked and desperate. 

When they confirmed what I already knew to be true, I crumbled.

But wow, I wish I could go back in time all those years ago and tell myself it would be okay. I wish I could tell myself to save the stress. Why the fck was herpes, of all things, making me into a big messy crybaby? Ugh. 

I take generic Valtrex daily, so I don't experience outbreaks. My life is so normal.

I disclose via text and it's not even something I bat an eye at anymore. Most people don't care.The responses are so boring at this point.  I've dated, had one night stands, had casual sex, had relationships. I've not ever transmitted it to my knowledge. I've even told some friends now. I figured why not? What if one day they encounter a date with herpes? The least I can do is help normalize it to my inner circle.

I feel like a badass every time I disclose with confidence. I feel so calm about it. People always thank me for my openness. I used to bawl like a baby while disclosing, which made it so much worse. 

Your life is not over in any way, shape, or form. Stop doom scrolling and panicking. Grieve and be upset, but only for so long. You have a treatable medical condition that SO MANY OF US have. Breathe!

Paranoid.,"so, recently i found out that a partner i was sexual with twice(only oral) has ghsv. i told him that it was fine and that i was okay with it. i tried to be as understanding as possible considering the stigma around it especially ghsv. i can’t remember the last time we were sexual but it was around 5-6ish months ago.

i just feel very hurt because he’s just now telling me, i understand he was probably nervous or insecure but it definitely changes things for me and i can’t help how i feel.

with all that being said, i’ve been very sick with flu symptoms this whole month, it’s been accompanied with headache and cough and runny nose which is why i’m confused as if i’ve been infected or not and it’s just now presenting. my lower body has been killing but no outbreak or anything. it doesn’t burn to pee, no tingling sensation or anything like that. just body aches.

if it even matters , he didn’t appear to have any open cuts or wounds when i did perform oral on him. i’m not sure if he’s taking any antiviral medication at all either but i’m assuming he’s not.

Unsure if I really do have HSV-2,"Hi so I got a general test for all sexually transmitted related things when I was 16 (because my parents found out I was sexually active, at this point I had only been intimate with 2 people) my results came back as inconclusive. Honestly it’s so long ago that I do not remember the exact numbers but I do know the test that detects recent infections was non reactive and the other one was a high inconclusive result. My parents, myself and my bf just concluded that I do have it. We all moved on.

But….

I’m almost 21 now and I still have never experienced a single OB or other related symptoms to HSV-2. Around 6 months ago I made an appointment to test whether or not I do have it because I am aware that there are a LOT of inaccuracies with blood tests. 

I did the EIA test and received another “grey zone” result (1.05). I still am with the same person I was back then, therefore my body count is still at 2. I’ve only kissed other people prior to that because I was still very young. I just find it extremely hard to believe that I do have herpes type 2. If I tested positive for herpes type 1 I’d understand, I went to summer camp, everyone shared water bottles etc. it’s more realistic! 

My boyfriend went to the clinic and the doctor refused to test him because visibly he was fine and unless there’s symptoms the doctor didn’t want to test him. The doctor explained how inaccurate the blood tests are in our country which is why he didn’t want to give the test, he said the emotional repercussions are far worse than the physical.

It’s been 4 years, I should’ve felt something, anything, by now. My boyfriend should’ve had something happen to him too, but there’s zero symptoms. 5 years together and nothing has ever came up. Where I live the Western Blot test is unavailable so I will never know 100% if I do have it or not. If things don’t work out with my current partner do I need to disclose that I might have herpes?

Stuck in a herpes limbo…,"Hi guys, looking for some advice, apologies for long post but it is quite a difficult circumstance to explain.

I first thought I was having a herpes outbreak a year ago. I had burning pain round anus (sorry for TMI), shooting pains down thighs,  buttocks  and testicles, no blisters but what looked like some small red spots round anus. Went to get a test but due to the shitty state of sexual health clinics during lockdown (all walk-ins cancelled) and how hard it is to get an appointment, did not get swabbed until after symptoms had started dying down. Dr said swab would be way less accurate because of this. This came back negative.

 Doctor said it was not a clear cut herpes case and if swab was negative to carry on with life as normal, which I did. Everything seemed fine until around 4 months later, I had a flare up of these symptoms again. Again, I went to clinic and went as soon as possible, again came back negative, but again accuracy of this was reduced due to the time it took to get swabbed ( think I had to wait around 6 days to get in to a clinic).

I stopped having sex with anyone and told myself I would wait till I know for sure my status before carrying on. I bought self test kit for if an outbreak ever came. Since then, I’ve never felt like I have had an outbreak, but I have very regular nerve pain, down my anus, buttocks, thighs - It can be really painful! So strange, as this didn’t happen at all in the four months between suspected outbreak 1 and 2.

Fast forward to now, I’ve recently used my swab kit once when I felt some pain down there and that also came back negative. I have accepted that I probably have it and can handle getting on meds and disclosing to partners etc, but can’t do this until I know for sure that I have it! I’m at the point where I would actually like an outbreak so I can get tested and know for sure - till then not really comfortable sleeping with anyone.

A question about frequent outbreaks,"I wanna ask something for women who have gHSV2, strong immune system and still experience frequent outbreaks (at least 1 for every month). 

I diagnosed gHSV2 in January, 2021 and in August I started using daily Valtrex because I experience frequent outbreaks. My mental health was so bad. And my immune system is so strong, I usually don’t get flu etc. 

So my questions is are there any women like me out there experience frequent outbreaks although they have strong immune system and how many years did it take to decrease your outbreaks’ numbers? 

I wanna quit daily Valtrex but I don’t wanna experience outbreaks again because the only thing works for me until now is Valtrex.",tionmc,1,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tionmc/a_question_about_frequent_outbreaks/,2022-03-20 12:21:48-04:00
Suspicion of primary infection,So I (26m) just started seeing someone new about a week and a half ago. About 4 days after our first hookup I became very sick with flu like symptoms and tonsillitis that is finally going down now. I tested negative for strep and covid and was prescribed amoxicillin anyways. Just yesterday I started to get swollen gums around my teeth and just this morning I noticed a small circular painful ulcer on the roof of my mouth. Does this sound anything similar to a primary infection? I don’t see any ulcers around my gums other than the one on the roof of my mouth. I also do not know how to tell her she may have infected me because I really do like her and do not want to sound accusatory.,tilbtx,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tilbtx/suspicion_of_primary_infection/,2022-03-20 09:42:09-04:00

He offered other ways for us to be intimate but I’m not going to date someone who has expressed they do not ever want to have penetrative sex with me. I’m just so mad because this was not my fault.

Hi. I just got diagnosed today and I am devastated.,"Repost to a throwaway acc, sorry.

I’m 21F and I actually liked the guy that I’m pretty sure gave it to me, although he was just a fuck buddy. The timeline and his fuzzy answers about his past added up, but when I approached him about it he was just fully defensive and insisted it wasn’t him although admitting he’d never been tested and it sounded like he never will. I feel like my life is over and my world is crumbling. I just got the diagnosis and I’ve already faced stigma. I feel like I can’t even trust myself even though he’s logically the one who gave it to me. I have had 2 other partners recently but I had been seeing them several times before this one and hadn’t had any issues. Then I see this guy once and have symptoms within the week. Still, I just hate myself and I truly don’t know how to cope. I just want to curl up in a ball and it’s like my heart has been ripped out of my chest. Im sure that a lot of people feel this way when they’re first diagnosed but I feel so alone and ashamed. I feel like it’s my fault. Can someone out there please just give me some hope? I was freaking out so badly that I was almost committed last night, it’s really bad guys. I can’t stop sobbing and I feel like my life is over.

I Keep Hearing The Stigma is The Worst Part But Is It?,"I just contracted GHSV1 and am experiencing my first outbreak.

I haven't been hiding it so far. I told planned hookups I can't meet atm due to contracting it. Told past partners to check for it and told the person I think gave it to me to get tested. I have told my parents. I've told my BFF and a few others I'm close to. I've also told medical staff that didn't know during appointments in order to assure everything was done safely.

I think I'm able to talk about it matter of factly so people don't react badly. I'm not ashamed.

I'm not ashamed but I am really scared. Cause this shit hurts. 

It started out not so bad but now it's more blistery. Things feel so sore I can't do anything but lie down with my legs spread and then the itchiness becomes obvious. I can't say I've managed to avoid scratching cause I definitely have scratched.

The doctor said I probably won't have another outbreak but reddit is showing me a different reality. For people with GHSV1, how often are outbreaks for you? How do you deal? There's no way I could go to work like this if I had a job.

Person I’m seeing bashed on herpes... I have herpes,"So I (25F) am seeing this other woman (28F). By the way, I told her I had hsv-1 only a few days after started talking just to get it out of the way. I’m asymptomatic and have never had an outbreak, I just tested positive by blood test. 

We were having a conversation about safe sex and what not, and she said she was once going to hook up with someone and the other girl disclosed she has herpes.

Immediately I was like “umm you know I have herpes right??” It got kinda awkward but I immediately told her that it’s very common and my ex got it from kissing her mom as a child. She seemed to be really supportive after that, and obviously was ok with me having it. 

However..is it possible to recover from that? I’m sure she felt just as awkward as me. Is how she reacted a red flag or is it something we could get past because she was willing to listen ?

High Arginine in pre workout & protein powder,So prior to my diagnosis I was pretty active/fit and would drink pre workout/ protein powder as part of my routine. When I got diagnosed with genital hsv I stopped working out entirely due to depression and what not. Now a few yrs later Ive started working out again like before BUT I’ve noticed that any time I drink pre workout or protein powder now I get nasty outbreaks. It usually causes me to stop working out for at least a week because of the pain. I checked the ingredients and most pre workout/protein powder has SUPER high amounts of arginine in it which I gathered I’m very sensitive to. Now I’m not taking any workout supplements which I get is no big deal but I like the routine and energy/muscle I get from the pre workout/protein powder. I’m wondering if anyone else has experienced this and if you found supplements that didn’t cause outbreaks that are low in arginine???

I genuinely do not want to live,"Before I start I have to clarify that my feelings are not just about herpes, I had a very troybled upbringing and life and this is just the final nail in the coffin.

I found out from a partner I slept with I gave her herpes, she had not had a partner in a very long time  except me and she has zero reason to lie and I know its the truth. The mental anguish of knowing I gave her genital herpes has messed me up for quite a while and recently I have researched it and realised my chance at love or casual sex is literally gone.

I undeestand there are females out there who can still get partners while disclosing but trust me for guys it is much, much harder. I have heard how women discuss herpes, checked online polls and most women clearly say it is not worth the risk. I am not a model, or succeseful so I do not bring enough to the table to even out the scales. 

I do not mean to offend anybody, I just can not cope with the fact due to bad luck my chances of finding a partner or love has lowered so much and I may as well say good bye to casual sex.

It just feels like God is knocking down every part of my life one by one as he needs me to die, abusive childhood to mess up my personality, having me vanish for years with my Dad to mess up my education, giving me severe insomnia amd mental health issues to mess up my job and worklife and now this to ruin my sex and love life.

Worried I made a mistake and obsessing to the point of breakdown. How long can prodrome last?,"Bit of a background story to start. So a friend of mine 32(f) just had her first genital herpes outbreak ever. I 32(m) have been consoling her and trying to support her. By the time she went to the doctors her swab tests came back negative and the doctor said it’s because the sores had already begun to heal but they were sure it was herpes. They said to wait until her next outbreak to determine what type so as of now no confirmation as to what type she has. She was feeling most of what I see here, depression, worried she would never be able to date again or have sex, and feeling really bad. She expressed to me that because she couldn’t have sex it was making her affection and sex starved. She asked if I would feel comfortable using toys on her and I said as long as I don’t have to penetrate her myself, sure. 

I went into this not fully informed and thinking that because she had a negative swab test that must mean she’s not currently contagious but have since learned I was incorrect. I used a dildo on her and for a brief moment I even rubbed her clitoris with my thumb. I could not see any visual marks or signs of herpes. I took a brief moment to go wash my hands and return and continued to use a dildo on her. I asked if it was ok if I masterbated so we could finish together and she said yes. We both finished, cleaned up and then a little later she left. After I came back down to earth and started thinking about things more I started reading up and realizing that she most likely could still be very contagious and I began to worry about cross contamination on my hands and then touching my penis. I feel like my hands definitely got fluids on them at times but we were using plenty of lubricant and I’m not positive if it was lube or her fluids. 

I began to worry really bad that I had mad a mistake. And that worry spiraled into a full on hypochondriac episode. A day later I began to feel tingling on my penis under the head mostly on the left side and I wouldn’t describe it as burning but I could definitely feel a sensation when I peed. I am stuck between hyper fixating on what I feel and trying to determine if it’s the incubation and prodrome kicking in or if I irritated myself by washing my hands with bath and body works foaming soap before masterbating and then also using a little of that soap directly on my penis afterwards. It’s now been 5 days since the encounter and I still feel the sensation come and go. I’ve been having some of the worst anxiety and have not been able to eat or sleep properly and I work a physically demanding job and I’ve felt awful. 

I guess my question is, is it possible to experience prodrome symptoms for 5 straight days with no visible marks. I would describe what I’m feeling as a tingly irritated sensation on my left side under the head that comes and goes. I sometimes feel a little sensation and maybe the slightest slightest burn when I pee (if my pee is yellow) and I’ve even felt pressure in my testicles for 2 short moments the last 2 days. Does this sound like prodrome? Are prodrome symptoms constant or do they fade in and out? I have brief moments of feeling nothing/normal and can’t tell if my anxiety is making me hyperfocused on what I’m feeling or if I did give myself irritation and sensitivity from soap. 

I see that without an initial outbreak I’ll have to wait the duration of the incubation period to a)see if there an outbreak and b)won’t have antibodies for a blood test until at the very very earliest 12 days after initial contact, and I’m aware in most cases it’s much longer. I have a doctors appointment coming up which puts me at 14 days after initial contact and this wait and see is giving me some of the worst anxiety I’ve had in years. I just want input from someone who has any insight to provide. I was just trying to be a good friend and supportive and make her feel like she will always be accepted but now feel like I may have made a mistake by not doing my due diligence as to how to safely go about sexual encounters with her. I’m definitely feeling things and have convinced myself I cross contaminated myself even though I know there’s a good chance it’s soap irritation. I don’t know what is rational and irrational at this point and the wait is killing me.",thwljs,3,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/thwljs/worried_i_made_a_mistake_and_obsessing_to_the/,2022-03-19 10:41:18-04:00

But seeing as both of us already have both forms of HSV—is there really even any point in refraining from sexual activity? As long as the symptoms are not painful for either of us, am I correct to assume there isn’t really much else at stake if we decide to be sexually active through outbreaks? 

I base this on the notion that you can’t catch HSV again once you already have it, and that re-exposure to HSV will not trigger an outbreak.

8 weeks ago I tested again and got a positive results of 1.46 HSV 2 igG.

However… 
For the past 3 weeks I been having some sort of a minor groin rash (redness) in my inner thighs. It comes and goes every now and then. 

- Is this an HSV2 symptom ?  I researched about it and it looks like it might be. But I don’t see people here taking about it/ experiencing it.

Soothing pain from outbreak (see details),"Hi! 23F with HSV2.  Sorry to triple quadruple post but this is the most information i have received and my doctor seriously dropped the ball. (I will be going to a second). 

What can i do to soothe the pain? Ice cubes? 

I have been sitting in the shower with my legs open letting the water hit my lower vulva leading to my anus opening where all the outbreak is but it is not enough. Lidocaine cream prescribed by my doctor helped a little too but still so freakin uncomfortable. She also said to keep it open and not put bandages on it but i feel like i am leaking from the open wounds. Should i do something? I can’t sit spread eagle forever.

How contagious is it to yourself.,"Hi. I’m sorry to bother. New here and diagnosed yesterday. My doctor was horrible. She barely consoled me, didn’t really give me a ton of information and just kinda left the room after saying go get your blood test down the hall now. No anything about you’ll receive your results in so and so days no I’m sorry nothing. Anyways, she told me that if i sit down in the shower with my lesions and then my sister goes to take a shower later and sits down that she will contract it if i don’t clean the tub. 

She basically scared me into never having anything touch the lesions that will touch elsewhere. I have been self in wearing gloves when I wipe when I pee and gloves when I put lidocaine on the sores. I’m just so scared of spreading it. 

I don’t even need to worry about sex because I’ve decided I’m abstinent the rest of my life. I am beating myself up so so super hard about this. Just trying to make sure me and my friends and fam are as healthy as can be. Fuck men honestly. (No i know not everybody but you would say it too!!) All my diagnosis has really shown me is that i failed myself in focusing on myself and getting me where I needed to be. 

Now… this is what I have to live with for the rest of my life. I have many regrets. Trying to find some optimism and positivity in all this but it’s a little hard… maybe because it’s been just two days knowing it is really what it is.

Question about seeing someone who might have Herpes…,I’m currently talking to and very interested in a girl that I know has slept with someone that has Herpes. He’s a decent friend of mine but her and I have been talking recently and I’m really into her. They were just fuck buddies and he gave me the 100% okay to go for it. I haven’t talked to her about it yet and I also haven’t really asked him in too much detail about the medication he takes or if he uses protection. I’m basically in a situation where she could potentially have it. I’m tempted to ask for a negative test from her to be on the safe side but I don’t want to come off offensive.

newly diagnosed HSV2,"I'm so tired of men who tell me they can't cum with a condom on, then look at me like it's my job to accommodate. I'm tired of men who never test themselves because they don't have symptoms. I'm tired of male friends judging me because I haven't found the right person and been able to maintain a long term relationship. I'm tired of being blamed when I've been told by every partner that they're clean and I've always provided condoms only to to have the guy remove them when my back is turned. 

I've had myself tested every year. I used to be a sex worker. When I was a SW, men never took the condom off and only once did a client ask to try uncovered. He was immediately denied and I never saw him again. Four years past, four years of clean tests and not working as a SW and unsuccessfully dating, I test positive after seeing two men who swore they were negative because their previous partners tested negative, but they didn't get tested. I was weak and thought I was in the monogamous relationship that might be the one. I've contacted both of them and they're trying to blame me. 

I'm trying to date again and it's so hard to tell someone before having sex that I'm HSV2 positive. I've never had an OB, but I take valtrex daily. I always have condoms available. I feel like I'm the dirty one now.

Struggling,"I tried to not post depressing shit here. It’s already depressing enough. But idk what to do anymore. 

In the beginning I kind of accepted it.  
I found solace through helping others & learning as much as possible. But right now I feel like all my work has been halted. 

i just can’t help but feel depressed most days. I feel angry that this happened to me, I feel pissed that a skin rash is going to forever fuck up my love life. I’m so sad and touch starved, I feel disgusting all of the time. 

Every tingle, every strange feeling, i worry that I’m shedding. I’m on meds, changing my diet, but I never know what’s truly going on in my body at all times and it makes me feel so out of control. 

Whenever I post a picture I know I look good, but I can’t help but feel none of that matters because If people knew I have herpes, they wouldn’t care about my looks. It honestly sucks having this and being black. We’re already constantly judging each other for what we do and don’t bring to the table, now I have to get judged for this. This shit is debilitating. I don’t wanna get out of bed at all most days.

Are photos actually welcome here?,"I was diagnosed officially yesterday. Began having symptoms of bumps that gradually became lesions and now have spread on the whole bottom genital area. 

It is not on my upper genitals where the hair and all that is. It begins like on the hair skin part adjacent to the middle of my vaginal opening and continues down to my anus. Nothing above that. They feel like pimples I guess but hurt like all God Damn F in Hellllllll. It started with just one. And now is multiple. My anus has multiple on the opening. 

I just wasn’t sure if it would help anybody actually at all. When i was trying to self diagnose myself before my appointment yesterday I had been searching all week and had trouble finding quality photos of outbreaks to compare. I wished there was (as gross as it may seem to some) because I was so lost and was trying to see what it could be. 

The sexual interactions I had was oral both ways and then penetration. He did NOT have anal with me, but my anus opening has so many bumps that are open (guess you call it a lesion at that point) that are killlllling me. He isn’t having an outbreak at all. No cold sores or anything for him. I am only experiencing this outbreak in my genitals not orally at all. He *FINALLY* is getting tested after hounding him to do it. (Seeing his true colors is another story for another day….) 

If it won’t help I won’t bother anybody. 

Thanks for all your help everyone. I could not be happier right now I have a community to lean on during this time. It’s scary. A whole new world. Peace and love to all ❤️

Shitty as fuck,"So I really need some kind words or anything at this point with the situation I’m in. When I found out about my diagnosis months ago, I confided in my best friend. I was so vulnerable and distraught to actually have something so serious happen to me that I haven’t experienced anything like it before I’m my life.

But now I’m having so much anxiety about her telling my secret. Especially to the shitty people who don’t have my best interests. 

Yes I shouldn’t have told her. I trusted her. But since we are on the outs now all I can think about is her telling my business. Yes I know for her to do that she is a shitty person and anyone who would gossip about it is literally so immature and uneducated and NOT worth having in my life. But damn it does not make it any easier. 

So I guess im just coming here to vent and see if anyone else wen through this. And what ways can I give myself a peace of mind.

I contacted Terri Warren. This was her response.

""Terri Warren wrote:

I strongly encourage you not to believe this diagnosis quite yet. The supplemental test from LabCorp and I'm assuming that's where it's from, has many false positives. You also have a low positive index value and the center for disease control recommends that you obtain confirmatory testing. Unfortunately, the supplemental test is not the best confirmatory test but the herpes western blot is. Also, the IGN test should never have been done. The Center for disease control says never to use it and Quest Diagnostics is taking it off of their list of tests that one can choose. I really do not think you should believe this diagnosis at this point. You can work with your own provider to get herpes western blot from the University of Washington or you can work with me but you need to get this test done.""

This really freaking sucks!


ORIGINAL:
I've always had ghsv1 (don't know how I got it).
My dr just called me that I have both hsv1 and hsv2 (I didn't ask him to test for it - went for routine gyn exam and wanted routine std screening).

I'm so irritated by this because even though I've had hsv1 for many years (I'm in my 30s) i now have hsv2 and have no idea how I got it.

I was just getting comfortable with ghsv1 (have a new partner and he's fine with it) but now I have to tell him this as well?!!!

And I don't even know if the hsv is genital or oral.

So frustrated!!!!

Igg scores in correlation to time?,"Ok so have posted on here before. Have gone through several weeks of Igg testing for myself.

Actually was testing more for hsv 2 from a potential exposure but all tests so far have come back negative for that. Never had a genital outbreak or something I would recognize as one so flipping that back to the potential of cold sores as a kid. My question is does anyone know how scores correlate to the length of having it? Seen plenty of posts here so far and doesn't seem to be an explanation as of yet. Saw someone say they got it from their spouse and had a score like 6 while that spouse had it for years and had a score of 48 or so. Seeing plenty of newly diagnosed people with low scores of around 3/4 just passed the false positive Igg potential line. Just trying to get some idea of the length that I've had it.

Lost at this point.,"Hello All,

I’ll get straight to it. Had unprotected sex and literally felt the need to frequently urinate hours later. I freaked out and took orals for chlamydia and gonorrhea. I’m 6 days from initial the day of unprotected sex and have felt the “tingles” throughout this time. Had a brief headache around day 4. I also started the oral for UTI on day 3. Have been out of it but I think that is more in line with my mental being out of whack from bad nerves. I have not a single bump or open sore. Still have a light tingle… I can tell something is off. Also experiencing tingles in my feet as of these last couple days. Could be linked to the antiviral medicine from what I’ve read. 

What is it that could cause me to have that frequent urination literally hours later?… the tingles… how long before I consider myself in the clear for herpes? 

I still feel a bit off down there, still peeing a bit often… but no bumps, no flu like symptoms really… 

What’s the likelihood of not having bumps after tingling for so many days and it being herpes?

Hsv best natural remedies,"I (34F) have had hsv2 since I was 20,which I caught from an ex I was with for 2.5yrs🤬! Anywoof 😝, I didn’t have major any major breakouts till I was 28 till now . I am against medication in general , but if it was bad I’d take  acyclovir,but I’d feel so weird after taking it ,maybe because I don’t take them daily ,who knows ! 

My breakouts are induced by bad diet,lack of sleep,and when I’m very stressed out ! However, I didn’t want to take the meds, so I started trying different things,such as L-Lysine, trying to improving my diet ,creams,and so on . That helped ,but takes way longer to heal. 

So oneday I’m talking to my bf and she discloses and I so felt so relieved , I finally had someone close to can talk to ! She hasn’t taken Rx in years(8+). Her regime is : she waxes religiously ,she believes with hair there it’s harder to heal and traps in the outbreak 🤷🏾‍♀️,if she ever feels a tingle she soaks in hot water, with ACV and a little bit of baking soda, once she gets out her soak, she soaks a cotton ball with alcohol and basically holds the cotton ball on the sore(yes it burns) her thought process is to dry out the sore, then dabs a bit of tea tree oil on there and sleeps with no panties . Also, every-time she uses the bathroom, she cleans the area with a alcohol pad and drinks nothing but lemon water . Soooooo I’ve been trying her regime and it WORKS FOR ME ALSO. I wasn’t a big fan of waxing but since I’ve started with the additional stuff  I’ve been break out free for a few months !

What are your natural remedies that have been working ? Do you take the medication everyday ? Is there a cream or ointment that works quickly for you ? I’m so curious to see if her and I are the only females that do this regime.",tgrze4,12,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tgrze4/hsv_best_natural_remedies/,2022-03-17 23:20:43-04:00
Help does this look like herpes.,"I (21F)have covid and I cant go to the docter. I send pictures to my docter and she said it was most likely herpes so she gave me antibiotics. But everything that I find on the internet about herpes does not sound like what I have. I also am a virgin. So here goes nothing:

What part of the body: genital area
Symptoms: 3 painful purple flat bumbs.
What do they look like: their purple brownish (now 1 with a white sort of layer above it)
It started 2 days ago with one bumb it looked like a mole at first, now 3. Newest one on the inside of my virgina and it's white, the other 2 (1 huge one a bit smaller) purple, one with a white layer since this morning.

There is no liquid inside it. They are flat and very painful.
They do not itch or burn. It does not hurt to pee or poop.
They only hurt when something touches them.
Virginal discharge is a bit yellowish, milk like. 
I dont know how to describe the odor. It has a smell but not something that would make me puke?

How long has the symptoms been there: 2 days now. Started Wednesday with a slight painful feeling but I thought I has just accidentally scratched myself but then Wednesday evening there was the first bumb.

Have they changed at all since they appeared: yes they multiplied by 3 and they grew bigger, colour changed on one since this morning. A white kind of layer. (I applied pictured)

My last sexual encounter: never. I'm a virgin (one of the reasons I have doubts)

No headaches,  no fevers, no body aches, no tingling sensation, no discomfort when urinating.

I think I covered every question in your reddit rules. Please tell me if this in any chance looks like herpes.

is this HSV? (photos included)," 

* located right inside on my labia majora 
* only symptoms are that it is uncomfortable/painful if it is rubbed/constricted like when I cross my legs/tight pants
* started as one pretty large red bump on tuesday(15th) night,(which is like 4ish days after I shaved) only noticed it because i put pressure on it when I wiped, never saw any fluid and appears to be a solid bump, now looks like it has a red dot in middle of it?
* I am having some vaginal discharge, thick, white, chunky, like yeast infection discharge and on wednesday it smelled very yeasty.
* haven't had any sexual activity since may of last year, according to doc, all tests were ""normal"" at that time

ingrown hair? pimple? yeast rash? HSV? HALP.

Anyone else experienced these first OB symptoms?,"Hi everyone! A month ago (2/17), I (24m) had sex with a girl I was seeing, only to find out afterwards through a text that she had gHSV2. We had intercourse and I received and gave oral. We used a condom, but I think we might have had some skin to skin contact before that, and she’s on aciclovir but she takes both doses in the morning and I read that you’re usually directed to take them throughout the day for max effectiveness. She told me that she’s never had an outbreak but was sieropositive. Anyways, I haven’t noticed any blistering lesions since then, but starting day 2 after exposure, I started feeling a faint burning sensation when I finished urinating (about a 2/10) accompanied by a pinching feeling in my urethra at times. I’ve also noticed some clear liquid at the entrance of my penis and that the tip itself is sensitive. This has lasted for straight up 30 days, and I have no idea what’s going on. Been tested for UTI and all STIs on the usual STI panel twice, and everything’s come back negative. I’ve talked to my doctor and it seems like she’s really hesitant to do a blood test unless I have blisters, but like I can’t imagine this is anything else but HSV with the timing and all.

Help,"I don’t know how to do this so I’m going to just type until I find the courage to get tested.

The first time I assumed it was a pad rash since my period was heavy and I didn’t change my pad at work and there was a lot of moist and friction. It was just sore. Then on my next period it came back. But again I assumed it was bc of the friction and moisture.

HSV1 Positive HSV2 False Negative Swab?,"Had sex wit someone and directly after started having to pee often. I figured I had a UTI and took penicillin. Symptoms weren't getting better after a couple days and instead I started to feel Irritation.

I went to the doctor and after checking me she was sure I'd contracted genital herpes and was experiencing an outbreak. She gave me a swab test.

She also tested me for a UTI and other STDs.

Everything came back negative except for HSV1 which was positive but I already figured I had that and didn't see how that explained my issue.

My HSV2 test also came back negative.

My urine UTI test was flagged for traces of Urine Leukocyte Esterase.

I have a red bumpy skin irritation on my vulva and anus that doesn't burn when I pee on it. The bumps are few and don't have the white top look I've seen on herpes pictures.

Herpes exposure?,"On May 6th I had unprotected anal and oral sex with a old fling. We were both tested clean but since regular STD panels in my country don't include for Herpes, I personally never know my status on that front. But I never had an outbreak my entire life or had anyone I had sex with that told me they have it. Cut to yesterday (17/3), this old fling texted me asking if I was tested or showed anything that might indicate herpes because he was showing symptoms the day before (16/3). He told me that the past three weeks he had sex with three different girls although I was the only one who he did unprotected with. The first one was on 23/2 and then me on 6/3. The last girl was on 12/3 and they did unprotected oral and he developed symptoms four days after that. 

Since I hooked up with him, I didn't feel any different. Didn't feel any symptoms whatsoever. I do have a few ingrown hair bumps which I had for months now mainly because I keep on plucking them. 

So my question is how likely is it that he transmitted it to me? Cos I read that for most symptoms shows up within days after exposure and it has been a week and I don't have any symptoms as of now. And how soon would it be best for me to do the blood test if I never show any symptoms?

I am absolutely positive that I got it from him, as I had negative tests beforehand and was not sleeping around. I want to sue the fuck out of him for doing this to me, but I imagine that he could easily claim that I got it elsewhere.

How do you know if you have hsv2 orally or genitally if you've never had symptoms?,"Recently divorced after 17 years. After divorcing, I recalled that a few years back my wife had told me that her doctor had told her she showed positive for herpes on her bloodwork and that I should get tested. I didn't think anything of it because we had been married over 10 years and I had no plans (so I thought) of ever having other partners, so I never got tested. Well, fast forward about 5 years, and after my divorce I decided to get a full panel done. Sure enough, it showed positive for HSV2. I've never had any kind of outbreak or symptom and neither had my ex. We were always sexually active so I think we would have noticed something. In the 17 years we were married we never had cold sores, genital sores... nothing. I'll probably be posting more questions here, but for now, I'm just wondering, since it's said that HSV1 and 2 can both be contracted orally and/or genitally, since I am asymptomatic, how would I know if I have it orally or genitally?

Stressing?!?!?!?,"I’m going to vent and rant a little so sorry In advance. Any advise would help.

So back In September 2021 I had an encounter and received oral only. (No symptoms atp)
Now fast forward to October 31 2021 and I ended up getting food poisoning. Every time I went to the bathroom it was like hell from both exits. I went to the doctor and they said it should pass. About a week later I still feel ill so I go back and she ask me what most doctors ask (eating habits, bad habits, sexual history) and I explain everything so she gives me a full panel sti test. I wait a few days and by this time I’m starting to feel better and all my test come back negative. (Hsv1,2 as well)
Now fast forward to January 2022 and I decide to take another sti test just to make sure everything is was still the same and it was but my hsv1 igg levels were an 8( hsv2 neg).
I’ve never had a cold sore and I started really thinking hard to remember if I did and I just can’t remember having one ever. So I wait until 3/10/22 and take another test and still neg for T2 but T1 came back at a 58.00H. I called but the doctor said it’s nothing to worry about.
To this day I have no symptoms and just feel really depressed. Like I understand it’s extremely common but I haven’t even worked up the strength to say it out loud yet.
 Should I take another test like the western blot? Or should I just take the L and continue living life regularly? Again sorry for the rant and any advise would really help.

A Cautionary Tale,"I was first diagnosed in late 2018 when I got a genital rash on my labia I thought was razor burn. When it kept getting worse I went to an urgent care doc who diagnosed me visually and wrote a Valtrex script but didn't swab. 

By the time I made it to my PCP, the swab was negative probably because it had been too long and was healing. My blood test was positive for HSV1 and negative for HSV2 and I got the same results a few months later. My doctor said she wasn't sure it the genital outbreak was actually herpes and that the HSV1 result could be old and wasn't a big deal at all.

I probably deceived myself by clinging to this possibility too hard and then genuinely forgot about it for a long time since I didn't have a second outbreak. For the next 3 years I was either single or in a relationship where we weren't intimate so it just never affected my life.

However in late last year, I got in a new relationship where we've been intimate and because it had been no big deal for so long, unfortunately I didn't disclose. We haven't talked about STDs ever so it was a lie of omission but still a deception. Our sex is pretty low risk and I honestly didn't think about it in the beginning.

However, I had an outbreak in early February (we didn't have sex during this time) and since then my life has been consumed with paranoia and guilt over this. I honestly think that stress has been affecting my health and I think she can tell I'm holding something back. I got a daily Valtrex prescription to try and further reduce risk but I honestly just can't live with this anymore.

I've decided I'm going to tell her next week. She's a doctor so will know the medical side already but I've accepted that my deception will end things. It hurts terribly to think about what I've done to her and the fact that I will lose someone I care about so much but I need to move forward with this. She deserves an honest partner and I need to start living in the light. 

I'm writing this to provide accountability to myself to have this hard conversation and to try and show the impact of non-disclosure to anyone wavering. An early rejection stings but the pain of this has been so hard. I know if I'm ever lucky enough to have a relationship again, I will disclose first thing.",tgcjgf,4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tgcjgf/a_cautionary_tale/,2022-03-17 11:17:16-04:00

What am I supposed to do if can't confirm I have herpes,"I recently had sex with someone who told me they had not had sex in three years and I am pretty sure they are telling the truth, and they told me I gave them genital herpes. I have never had symptoms and I felt suicidal I probably gave this person herpes. I went to an STD clinic and was told since I dont have symptoms not to worry and just forget about it. I looked up online that you can get a blood test but they commonly give false negatives or positives. So if I get thr test and it is negative am I supposed to just go through life not telling anyone as apparently the emphasis is only on people who get outbreaks or who pursue additomal tests to have to potentially ruin sexual relationships going forward. 

Do I have to base my sexual future and future partners well being on a coin flip on a test that is not fully accurate?

I have been researching HSV1 and HSV2 non stop and I can not help but feel there is no way such high percentages of people having herpes as I never have had someone disclose or heard of someone disclosing etc.

U can live a normal life,"I was 18 when I found out I had herpes and honestly I was just glad it was aids . I got herpes by being in a relationship and my partner gave it to me .. and it's funny because most people think that you get STDs by sleeping around but that's not really the case well at least not with me .

Anyways I caught my ex cheating with another man and I for one immediately knew this relationship was over and two wanted to get tested .
When i got tested I honestly didn't know what to think but I did know whatever the outcome was I was gonna make it .
When the doctor diagnosed me when HSV2 of course I was devastated because I mean when people talk about herpes they talk about it like you will constantly have warts and breakouts and your life is over so I'm here to tell you it's not . 

1. Forgive yourself..cause I know when you found out your diagnosis guilt immediately set in but you have to forgive yourself
2. Research, research, research..herpes both type 1&2 are actually very common so common that it's not even on most std panels like you have to ask for it . And most people are asymptomatic so they don't even know that they have it.

Hello! I have a major problem with herpes zoster and HSV-1. I am looking for help with how to talk to my doctor.,"Hello everyone, I have herpes zoster and HSV-1. I contracted both as a child. Fast forward to my late 20s, and everything started to go downhill. Whenever I have a virus or too much sun exposure, I either get : herpes blister on mouth or nose, Bell’s palsy, full body hives and swelling, nerve pain along the nerve with the sore.

I am currently in the middle of a really bad outbreak following the common cold, and I have a huge herpes sore on my lip, swollen mouth, full body hives and swelling, and facial nerve pain. My dr is giving me zyrtec and prednisone. It’s only working a little bit.

I have 2 questions: 
1. Has anyone experienced intense gastritis with the anti virals ? Like, so bad you can’t function? Because I do. My doctor will not, currently, give me a solution to this problem.

2. Has anyone experienced these full body symptoms with an outbreak? Full body hives and swelling for days?

I just got told about an hour ago that I e got herpes,"Sorry, I’m sure these kinds of posts are very common and annoying here, but I’m freaking out.

My doctor has been trying to reach me for a few days now, he finally told me today that I’ve caught it. The only encounter I can think of where I could’ve caught it was over a year ago! I haven’t even had a breakout yet (at least I don’t think so?). He said it’s genital, but I probably caught it from giving oral so then he said it’s probably both type 1 and 2? I don’t really understand it

He said if I haven’t had any symptoms then not to worry about it, but how do I know if I’ve spread it or not? I felt reassured when he said it only spreads when you have the sores, but not Google is telling me it can spread regardless. I can’t even kiss my family or my little brother because I’m scared they’ll just get it. For all I know I’ve been spreading it and I’ve passed it to one of them (assuming that’s how it works). I’m just very confused and nervous, I don’t want anyone near me I feel like I’ll somehow spread it, I’d feel a lot better if it was just type 2 and I don’t gotta worry about my mouth but again the doctor said it’s probably both types

Sorry for ramble, any help is appreciated

Edit: I just realised my doctor probably thinks I received oral and not that I gave which is why he may think I could have both? When most likely I just have hsv-2? I’m not sure, but if I have 2 does that mean I can’t spread it through saliva or how does it work I’m confused",tgdb7t,2,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tgdb7t/i_just_got_told_about_an_hour_ago_that_i_e_got/,2022-03-17 11:52:08-04:00

another is this herpes post,"hello all! i just wanted to raise some concerns to your awareness and i would appreciate it if you all could use your best judgment.

I am a 21F who has never been tested for HSV1 or HSV2. I get my regular std panels done often but it has recently come to my attention that HSV1/2 is not regularly screened.
First of all, wtf doctors, atleast tell us!!
second of all, ive had maybe 23 partners my whole life (church girl went to college and took freedom too seriously). Most were protected but many weren't. Ive tested negative for all stis/stds that are regularly tested.
I recently developed a yeast infection (i started using flushable wipes more, don't know if that would trigger it) before my period and recognized a dull pain on my right lower abdomen. I also started getting intense headaches. I went to the gyno and she suspects it could be ovarian cysts. I also realized I started to get more ingrowns (granted, i was shaving more often however I did start using a  shaving gel) which i asked her about and she was positive it was folliculitis. I am done with my period and the abdominal pain is still there (not intense so very bearable) but my yeast infection is back. bc of the weird symptoms i started researching and herpes came up for things mistaken for a yeast infection. i keep overly checking for sores and nothing is there. i have no tingling or soreness or pain around my vagina but it is itchy. it doesn't hurt or burn when i pee. 

I started having sex with a new partner since january. he got tested for everything and nothing came up (was not tested for hsv1/2 as no one is) before we had sex. ultimately, Considering how many partners i've had, i've been in my head about my likelihood of getting it or already having it. ive never had a cold sore or anything like that for as long as my memory could recall. 

do my symptoms relate to anything hsv1/hsv2 related? this whole side pain has really thrown me off so idk what else it could be, the diagnosis was not satisfactory to me and genuinely considering my likelihoods just bc of my body count has made me spiral

Can herpes cause only burning?,"

Several years ago in 2017, I was tested for herpes.
If I was exposed- it happened in late June of 2017 or early July 2017.
I went to a doctor just to be checked and make sure, no issues- just paranoid.
She did a herpes test.
IGG on 
July 19th was 1.11
July 31st was 1.26
September 1st was .78

In lieu of no symptoms, and IGG not rising she dismissed the herpes diagnosis, which caused me a lot of emotional distressed.

Fast forward

In 2018 I had a baby.
Followed by IUD, IUD removed, Birth control.
The constant rise and fall of hormones caused me to get a infection ( BV) in April 2019

In June i  started to complain of my urine bothering me. My concerns were dismissed and I fought a infection for over a year. During that year, I burned constantly, but have fought the burning urination.
It’s my skin burning.

I have no irritation or redness, no visible sores.  I do have puffiness in my Labia minora almost every single morning, burning in what I think is my Labia minora.  
I think the burning is triggered by urine hitting it.
If the area is touched, it doesn’t hurt but if I pee later after the area has been touched, it burns.
No doctor sees anything visually wrong with me.

My partner has no issues.

IF I had herpes, I don’t think I would have a constant issues with this, but it’s always sitting in the back of my mind.

If anyone experiences issue with burning only as a symptom, please let me know.",tg9mks,2,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tg9mks/can_herpes_cause_only_burning/,2022-03-17 08:57:00-04:00

Successful disclosure! (Mostly),"So I (32m) just started hanging out with this girl I was insanely attracted to, both physically and personality wise.  We had a first date, hit it off, and she suggested we go back to my place. Now pre-diagnosis me would’ve tried to hook up immediately,(admittedly, I’m kind of a sex addict and generally tend to have toxic relationships that start with impulsive sex), but since I’ve been diagnosed, I’ve been trying to positively reframe it as a good excuse to take things slow and actually get to know someone instead of having a sexual connection right off the bat and clouding my judgement with whether or not I should date someone. 

We get to my place and she wanted to drink with me, but I told her I couldn’t as I was her ride home. She asked if it was cool if she stayed, and I told her it was fine, but we couldn’t have sex due to the reasons explained in the above paragraph. Obviously, this was a half truth, but I felt as though it wasn’t the worst lie to tell, as it gave us both the opportunity to get to know each other. She was actually super happy to oblige, much to my surprise.

Cut to three dates and way too much dry humping later. Sexual tension was off the chart on both sides, and I decided she was someone I really wanted a shot with and was well worth the potential risk to embarrass myself entirely by disclosing.

She had herpes as well. I thought she was fucking with me at first, until she listed off everything she knew about it. On top of that, her mother and a bunch of her friends have it as well, and hearing that made me feel a little less freakish. 

We didn’t end up working out sadly, but it proved to me that finding someone who’s either cool with it or a carrier themselves is not nearly  the statistically impossible feat I assumed it to be. That, or I have insanely good luck, but I’d like to assume the former.",tfksqr,55,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tfksqr/successful_disclosure_mostly/,2022-03-16 11:44:37-04:00

These things didn’t bother me at first, slowly he wanted foreplay for himself but wouldn’t reciprocate.

My sex drive is at it’s all time low because I feel dirty and not worthy. I don’t want this to be a deal breaker between us, but he’s not budging that much.

Legal advice,"Hi all. This may sound absurd, I understand if it does. However I’m at my wits end. I was diagnosed with GHSV1 in December of 2020. It took an extreme toll on my mental health, to a level I can’t describe, as I’m sure others here also went through. Long story short, two people I   was close friends with at the time of my diagnosis whom I shared it with I am no longer friends with. Since May of 2021, they have posted a public video on social media disclosing my diagnosis & making fun of it, saw me at a hometown bar this summer and decided to tell everyone we went to high school with who also were at the bar that night (there were many people, especially those I knew) for no reason. I had no contact with them at ALL that night, and walked far away any time they were near me. Not one word was exchanged between us. Tonight, they’ve once again posted it on social media. All of this has been done in a malicious / cyber bullying intention and I’m incredibly tired of this. I have not spoken to any of these people since May of 2021 and for whatever reason this has continued. I literally moved to the opposite end of the country in July 2021 and it is still continuing. Surprisingly, I’m quite unbothered with this happening again in the sense that I don’t feel the need to confront like I normally would. I feel that the only people who look pathetic in this situation are the two who are stooping low enough to spread personal information regarding herpes. However, I’ve had enough of this and am tired of hearing that they’re continuing this. Normally I wouldn’t take much or any action in this situation, however I’m tired of this happening & worry about how this has continued and potentially will continue to worsen my mental health. I am wondering if there is ANY sort of legal action that can be taken, even a civil lawsuit. I know it sounds absurd. I know I should not let this effect me and I am trying my hardest and at the same time it’s not right that this is happening and I want to be left alone. I know defamation and libel are not an option because this is true information, but if there’s ANYTHING I can do, please let me know, even if it’s a stretch and there’s slim chances of it going anywhere.

So I have HSV-1 (oral herpes) and have had it for the longest time. Just checking about these do nots?,"Probably got it from my mom or something when I was younger, I am 39. Flares up only when I am stressed. Managing ok with it generally. 

However as a responsible individual, I Googled and am also asking here about the do-nots, which I think are :

a) No kissing allowed? (I didn't kiss my last gf because of my condition)

b) No oral sex? 

c) No sharing of utensils or food? (I actually share food on a semi-regular basis with quite a lot of people, maybe I should not have been doing that?)

d) No unprotected PIV sex?

From what I have read, it's the most contagious during an outbreak, but also can be spread without one?

Emotions all over the place,"I was just diagnosed with gHSV2 yesterday via PCR swab. I only have one ulcer on the side of my clitoral hood. It's annoying and painful but it could be worse (I hope it doesn't get worse)
When my husband and I first started dating, he disclosed his herpes diagnosis. We weren't sexually active until we got married last September. So I've always known it was a risk and we found that using protection interfered with our feelings of intimacy. 
I've known I'd get it at some point. But now that I actually have it.. I'm feeling so hopeless. Logically, I know that eventually it'll be no big deal and that it doesn't change who I am or anything.. but I'm so depressed and angry. My emotions are all over the place. I'm trying so hard to not take it out on my husband, because I knew the risks. I already know I'm going to be with him the rest of my life, so I probably won't have to deal with disclosure before sexual contact ever. 
But I'm spiraling, and no amount of logic or common sense is making it stop. 
I have a friend that's very open about her herpes and her experience so I'm planning on meeting up with her for lunch this week to talk. I'm doing everything I can to get support through this because I struggle with self harm when I feel out of control and I want to get through this without hurting myself.

Almost constant hsv2 symptoms.,"Hi all, 

I’ve had HSV2 (genital) for around 20 years. I take 1600mg of acyclovir a day, 1000mg of lysine and use lomoherpan as and when. 
My actual outbreaks aren’t too common, probably 5 or less a year. However, I go through periods of experiencing prodromes for months on end. My labia feel sore all the time, as though grazed, although there’s nothing visible. I can also feel pain and pressure there, as well as nerve pain in the back of my leg. 
I’m generally very healthy (I haven’t even had a cold for years). 
Doctors either don’t believe me, don’t know what the issue is or just aren’t interested. Goes without saying that it ruins my sex life because I’m super cautious about passing it on. I also contracted the virus through a r*pe as a child so symptoms are very triggering at times. 
Is anyone like me? Does anyone have any information or advice for me in terms of how to better control it? 
Thank you.
Edit: thank you so much for everyone taking the time to comment. It seems the issue is thrush, so not herpes related although super similar. Such a relief that I can actually cure it. I’m really sad that doctors hadn’t spotted this and I guess it’s so important for them (and us) to remember that herpes won’t be our only gynaecological issue.",tfk6do,12,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tfk6do/almost_constant_hsv2_symptoms/,2022-03-16 11:26:44-04:00

Increased outbreaks after covid vaccine?,"Hi all! I am by no means trying to start a pro-vax/anti-vax debate here. I'm just curious if anyone else has had an increase in outbreaks since getting the covid vaccine? I have had 3 now in 6 months (while taking daily Valtrex the whole time) since I got vaxxed this past summer! Previously I was just getting one per year if I wasn't taking daily Valtrex, and I NEVER got an outbreak while taking it. Not much else about my life has changed; in fact, I've moved out of a big city and quit my stressful job so I feel like it wouldn't be additional stress causing it. I'm hoping things will even out and go back to ""normal"" soon.

Waiting for intimacy with HSV2 exposed partner?,"I (f) have recently started seeing an amazing person (m) who I'd like to be intimate with soon. He has disclosed to me that he recently had unprotected PIV sex with someone (f) who is HSV2 positive - the last time being a month ago.

Apparently she hadn't had a symptomatic flare / episode for the past six months so he assumed the chance of transmission would be very low. However based on my reading it seems there may be a \~10% chance of transmission to him in this case. I would like to avoid potential transmission to myself if at all possible.

I'm wondering what the best way forward is to inform and protect myself? Some options I'm thinking through below - all thoughts / advice most welcome!

\- Gather more info about his likely exposure e.g. how many times they had unprotected sex, how long she has been living with HSV2, whether she takes any antiviral meds, how frequently she experiences symptomatic flares / episodes?

\- Refrain from all genital contact and PIV sex with him until 12 weeks have passed since the last exposure (i.e. \~8 weeks from now) and he can take an IGG test to see whether he's contracted HSV2?

\- Invite him to take an IGG test now (\~30 days after the last exposure so not ideal as I understand it should be 12+ weeks for most accurate results), only engage in condom-protected genital contact and PIV sex with him until 12 weeks have passed since the last exposure, then he can get another hopefully more conclusive IGG test?

\*I don't believe he's been exposed to HSV2 via past sexual partners or at least has never had any symptoms. He also doesn't have any symptoms of HSV2 now. 

To be clear I'm into him and would like to engage in intimacy just feel it would be good to know his HSV2 status first (which likely isn't possible for sure for another \~8 weeks...) and be able to take some protective measures like condom use and antiviral meds on his part if it turns out he is now HSV2 positive.",tfvb2o,0,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tfvb2o/waiting_for_intimacy_with_hsv2_exposed_partner/,2022-03-16 18:44:13-04:00

I’ve had pain in the back of my thighs, hips, and lower back, intermittent burning throughout my body (mostly my lower half) and frequent groin pain.

"Meds no longer working, I'm in excruciating pain EVERY MONTH. It's not ""just a rash"". Is this just my life now? I can't do it.","I just had the WORST doctor's appointment I've ever had, and I feel so hopeless. I emailed my ob/gyn last week because I'm having terrible outbreaks every single month, and I was getting desperate. I already changed from acyclovir to Valacyclovir because the first wasn't helping. I take 500mgs a day for prevention and 2000mgs a day when I feel symptoms coming on. If this is helping, I can't imagine what NOT taking it would be like. 

I thought I had covid again because my body hurt SO MUCH. I had to take two days off work because I felt like I'd been scalded and skinned from my kidneys to my foot. My muscles hurt, my joints hurt, my skin hurt. The lesion is the least painful part. It starts the week before my period and I'm literally in bed for at least 3-4 days. 

I emailed my doctor to ask if anything else could be done and I guess she's out of town but her staff made me a phone appointment with a different doctor. When she called she had no idea what I needed and when I started crying because I'm so uncomfortable talking about this and feeling so hopeless, she was completely rude and dismissive. I pulled myself together, told her I already tried acyclovir and exactly how much Valtrex I take, and she first came back with ""well, you can try acyclovir instead, it works a little differently"". I literally just told you I've tried it. Then she asked AGAIN how much Valtrex I take. I JUST SAID THAT! And she offered me lidocaine. There isn't enough lidocaine in the world. It's not the lesion that hurts! It's everything else! 

I feel like I can't express how terrible this is, and because I have a history of depression and anxiety, they treat me like I'm just being dramatic but it feels SO BAD!

Does GHSV2 stop OHSV1 outbreaks from happening?,"So I got diagnosed with GHSV2 about 3 years ago, but had oral herpes basically all of my life. I would get oral outbreaks pretty much every year like 1-3 times a year especially in the winter time. Ever since I got my GHSV diagnosis I’ve probably only ever gotten one oral outbreak. Im wondering did it stop because of the HSV2? 

Unfortunately tho, I’ve been getting frequent genital outbreaks. They’re very small and not really noticeable but I can definitely feel them. This happens almost every other month or every month sometimes 2 times per month. Is there any way to stop this other than taking antivirals ? It’s really annoying and I just want this to stop. I don’t eat meat, I started taking lysine 2-3 times a day for the past 2 months and I feel like it’s not really helping.  

I’ve honestly been having a difficult time coping with this and I’m trying my best everyday to get over it and not think about it but it’s hard when I’m constantly getting these little outbreaks.

A different way to look at herpes,"In a way this thing is a huge relief. Hear me out!

I’ve been positive with genital herpes for a little over a year. I had a swab test done so I never knew what type I had. I assumed GHSV2 but really hoped it was GHSV1. A few months ago I finally tested for type & found out I have both strains! Though I’m not entirely sure where my HSV1 is located. I have never had an oral outbreak. I assume it could be oral or genital too

Anyways it dawned on me how much of a relief it is I have herpes. I have both so it’s not like I can get it again. Like I can check herpes off my checklist lol. I get to relax & not worry about getting infected with the other strain. Sure there’s other minor stds out there but they’re nothing. Easily curable. HIV & Syphilis are still definitely a concern but that’s all I have left to be afraid of. Herpes has taken a few weights off my back. 1 less thing to stress over being infected with. If a fellow positive partner is having an outbreak I don’t have to worry about them giving me their strain.

Oral Herpes,"
21 F| About a month ago I got diagnosed with genital herpes from receiving oral sex from a guy. For about a week now my mouth, nose, throat and overall face has been itchy. I don’t have any sores or blisters but I’ve basically come to the conclusion that he also gave me OHSV. Is this usually common symptoms for somebody that has it??? And recently I met up with this guy who I’ve known for a while. He kept trying to kiss me even though I told him not to, and tried to avoid him kissing me altogether just to be safe. I didn’t tell him I had it because I’ve never been diagnosed with oral herpes and was unsure I had it. What is the chance he will catch it now? Even though he kissed me after I told him not to, I can’t help but to blame myself if he ends up with it. He’s really nice and the last thing I wanted to do was give this to him or anybody else. I’m away at college so I don’t have a primary doctor to get meds or even just talk to about this. I’m just very depressed and don’t know what to do. This situation is making me want to stay away from relationships and just stay alone.",tfip9p,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tfip9p/oral_herpes/,2022-03-16 10:18:05-04:00

Bumps formed after the cold sore scabbed and dried,"Hi,

I had the biggest outbreak of my entire life. 2 years without a cold sore and then I got hit with a massive cold sore, something I’ve never seen. Anyways, the sore went through all it’s stages taking about 2 weeks. Now, the sore is still there, with the small red bumps clearly showing with slight redness. As of the time writing this, it has been almost 3 weeks (1 week since the scab fell off completely). I never picked at it and it doesn’t look like a scar. Is this normal?

Best dating app for positive people?,"Hi all,

I met the love of my life 2 years ago and both of us are now HSV 2 positive. 

I’m also a technical cofounder and I realized that the hardest convo we ever had was when my partner disclosed to me she was positive after multiple dates. A lot of thoughts came rushing into my head and one of them was to create a free to use app that connected HSV positive people. I was looking on the App Store and see a lot of them are over monetized and pricey. 

If I were single again I feel like I would opt to use one of these myself so I figured I begin some market research.

Someone I'm newly dating has HSV-2 - want to educate myself about risk and safe practices,"Hi all -

Someone I *very* recently started seeing disclosed that he has HSV-2. First, I want to say that I have a lot of respect for him for being so transparent. He's answered the few questions I had for him and at this point we haven't done anything beyond kissing, and he's completely respected my decision to take it slow on the physical stuff for now.

That said, I'm incredibly attracted to him and want to sleep with him, but it would be helpful for me to have some more info from those of you in this sub with more experience. 

He told me he tested positive about 17/18 years ago, and has never actually had an outbreak. He gets tested for STDs routinely, so he tested positive without symptoms. He also told me that since being diagnosed, to his knowledge he hasn't passed it onto a partner (of course there's no way to be sure unless tested as they could be asymptomatic).

Given we aren't exclusive, I would use a condom with him regardless but am open to any other advice about risk in this situation.

Just confused,Two months ago I had unprotected sex with someone who I later heard had herpes and given it to multiple people. Now I’ve never heard this from any of the people they had mentioned. Either way I went and got tested a month later and got negative results for igm but a 2.64 value for the Igg and they said hsv2. When they called they said I tested positive for exposure and to come back in three months and that was it. Just wondering what the odds are it could be hsv1 or a false positive. I’ve already come to terms with my results as is but just curious.

First time sex after my HSV-2 Diagnosis,"Yep. I did it! We are both HSV-2 positive, but it was still hard as hell to have sex. I wish I understood why. The herpes diagnosis changed me, my thinking, in ways I'm almost ashamed to admit. Because how I feel about it falls right in line with the whole stigma at times, and I absolutely hate the stigma and fight it at every opportunity.

I just wrote this, I'm putting a link to the post. Nothing to sell on my site, no advertising. Just my writing. I found some incredibly helpful info and want to share it with all of you. It's been beyond helpful to read many of the articles on a variety of topics around female sexuality and orgasm. I hope you are as freed up by the info as I was! Oh, and btw, I did find a friend of a friend to have the scary looking but I hope incredibly helpful ""aid"" shipped to her address. Thank GOD! And it's in the mail now!

weird feelings after my diagnosis.,"i’ve almost completely come to terms with my diagnosis with GHSV2 4 months ago (18m). but ever since, i don’t think i’m the same sexually anymore. the idea of sex itself scares me. it’s like yeah, even before my diagnosis i admired intimacy with a person so much more than just straight up having sex. but now after, the idea of spreading it to the person has burnt into my mind that now i just don’t want to have sex. the idea of giving the person oral and seeing them enjoy themselves is still pleasing to me. just not sex. i was intimate with men and women before my diagnosis, just didn’t do anything after. 
now i have gotten a new boyfriend, we’ve just kissed and i gave him a handjob but nothing further than that because i’m terrified of disclosure. so…what is this? am i on the spectrum of asexuality maybe? because that’s what i’m thinking so far.",tf1uq3,4,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tf1uq3/weird_feelings_after_my_diagnosis/,2022-03-15 18:13:11-04:00

I’m in hell,"M/23 here, exposed 3/5, no disclosure until like the 11th or 12th.

She had a sore on her lip that i didn’t know about. She never mentioned it. She never specified if it’s 1 or 2, and I don’t think she knows either way, but not like I’m really looking to get an infection either way, but she said nothing before chowing down on my dick.

I didn’t notice any symptoms until she mentioned it. I don’t know if that stress just made me start a reaction, or if it’s all in my head, but my crotch has just. Itched. It’s somewhat where there could just be sweat or whatever—where the chub pushes together a little on the edge of the hips, but there have been moments on the shaft. Almost prickly. I’ve been probably reading too much. 

There’s no visible marks. *maybe* a small red dot right near the center of the area just behind the ridge of the head, just peeking right back at me when I pull back the bit of excess skin, but no cluster, and it’s maybe 1mm across at best. I’ve gotten my blood work done as of day 9, and I’ll be testing again obviously, but this whole “it could be” “it might not be” “god I think it might me” shit is tearing me apart. 

I’ve got my support, but this is the first time in a while I’ve struggled with active ideation. This changes so much about my lifestyle, and my health isn’t amazing to begin with. 

I just hate that she would try to cry to me about how victimized she was when she got diagnosed, yet she dared put me through this. I don’t wish the hell I’m in on anyone. 

I had plans this weekend, damnit. I has future plans that this fucks with. I feel like so much has been ruined.

First Disclosure advice,"Hi everyone, I have read all the posts in here for disclosure ideas and transmission rates. And looked at the wiki links and guide. I got a positive (33F) HSV2 test in November IGG 6.0 and symptoms. My OB was very minor that my doctor didn’t even think it was Herpes. I did the blood test on my own. I’m on 1000mg Valtrex and take lysine daily. I haven’t had any other symptoms however , I know that doesn’t mean I won’t eventually. This also concerns me with my initial outbreak I didn’t feel anything as in tingling or itching. I just noticed some random bumps. I only went to the doctor because I’ve had shingles before but I know getting shingles in that area is really rare so wanted to get it checked out. I’m concerned I won’t be able to tell when shedding is happening without bumps ever appearing, any advice on that?

I’ve been seeing someone since January. Him and I have known each other for 2 years and had previously dated a year ago for 3 months but split due to our schedules and work travel. Now we are both home regularly and talked about trying again. We have not slept together currently only kissed. I plan on disclosing Friday. Honestly, I’m really not sure how he will react it’s a solid 50/50 chance he will nicely decline or be ok with it. I know he won’t judge or be disrespectful so there’s that. 

Should I keep the disclosure short and sweet or detailed? Should I go in depth with the facts right away or how I got it? Sorry, I just really don’t know how to approach this. It’s scaring me a lot because we have a lot of mutual friends but I do trust him to not tell anyone. What has worked for you all? I have Terri Warrens book and a bunch of links to research ready if he asks for info to hand over. I’m also going to tell him to get screened. He does have quite a history of sleeping around and I highly doubt he has gotten a herpes test done. Condoms are a must because I am no longer on BC so that and meds I know the risk is lower but since idk how long I’ve had it. I believe I’ve read the rates are higher initially. I didn’t get the IGM test so not sure but symptoms appeared two days after a hookup so assuming I was exposed in November.

I did it :),"ghvs2 (f21) tw: SA/rape/violence

Hey guys!!! I’m so excited to tell you guys this even tho I’ve never posted or talked to any of you. I made an account just to tell you all about this.


So I was sexually assaulted last may and went to the hospital the morning after it happened (I was also stabbed and beaten really badly where my left side of my rib cage collapsed and had some head trauma)- had done a rape kit, the aids/hiv 72 hour thing, and regular std testing and was treated for my other injuries. I moved back home for recovery and when I was told my results at my home obgyn office they were clear. I went back to that office 4 times in the following six months for follow ups on my tearing, etc. I was really relieved and continued my healing journey- during this I wasn’t having sex with anyone, really isolated myself and just was really scared of sex and men in general, it really changed the way I viewed men and viewed sex and really how I viewed myself and my body and my sexuality really everything. Fast forward 6 months, the end of December/early January I noticed 3 raised white bumps on my left inner thigh/vaginal area. I called my obgyn and spoke to a nurse to ask some questions bc I didn’t know if this was a lady doctor issue or a dermatologist issue because I had never seen anything like this- I knew it wasn’t ingrown hairs but they weren’t blisters or ulcers and honestly I didn’t even think of it being herpes because I wasn’t sexually active since it happened and they had told me I was clear. While on the phone I was just describing exactly what I said and she replied “it sounds like you’re having an outbreak” at this time I had no idea what that meant so I said “outbreak? I don’t know what you mean” she then said “well in your chart it says you have herpes” I immediately freaked out repeating my name and birthday and asking her if she had the right person cause that can’t be right. No one told me in the 6 months I returned to that office multiple times. No one ever mentioned it. I had a great relationship with the nurses there and none of them had ever mentioned anything about it. I was crying on the phone and telling her that couldn’t be right. She was extremely apologetic and comforting she told me I would be okay and she’s so sorry no one told me and that this happened to me. I asked to schedule an appointment and to get retested to confirm. I just knew in my heart that I had it and was severely depressed the week leading up to my appointment. My mother went with me for support.


Long story short the assault gave me herpes. I was swabbed and it came back positive. I was really devastated. I was really hung up on the fact that no one told me. And not only that my doctor didn’t even think it was a big deal - he even recommended me not to tell anyone. Which I thought was fucked up. I got put on antivirals got some topical ointments and started researching what it was and I found this Reddit. I read the daily posts at 8pm every night when I got the Reddit notification. It made me feel so much better and like I wasn’t alone. The only person that knew was my mother- because she was there when I found out. 


I was struggling mentally to be quite honest. I’m already bipolar 2 and was recently diagnosed with PTSD. Not only did I have to remember this event for the rest of my life. But I now have to relive it every time I think about the fact that I have herpes because of it. 

During this time I had began seeing someone- I was finally feeling comfortable about men again, I was beginning to feel like my body was mine again and then i found this out. I hadn’t told him about the assault nor my new diagnosis. We would kiss and I’d spend the night sometimes and he would try to progress things forward but I always had the excuse that I was on my period or I wasn’t feeling well. I kept putting it off because honestly I didn’t know what to do or how to even begin telling someone - yet here I am telling the whole internet 😭- I had been doing this for about 3 months. I knew he would look at me differently I knew it would change things and that terrified me. He was the first guy I’ve felt comfortable with and I formed an attachment to since my assault. I remember when we first started dating we watched the juicewrld documentary and in the beginning they were clowning some guy joking about him having herpes- me being locked inside my head thought he would laugh but he really didn’t have any reaction. Fast forward 3 months later. 


Last night I went to see him bc he had just got out of the hospital from being sick this weekend. We were cuddling and he started trying to be intimate. I flat out told him “it wasn’t happening” he said okay and we went back to cuddling. I asked if he was mad at me and he replied “no why would I be mad?” And I just said I know how guys are — he could tell something was bothering me and he probably knew that something was up at this point I had been dubbing him for 3 months and asked me what was wrong I kept on saying nothing and he was like you can tell me. I just kept repeating I can’t I was legit terrified- I had begun crying by this point and I was trying to hide it terribly but I was trying to avoid telling him. I’d haven’t spoken about this to ANYONE. I had been sitting on this secret for months and was just entirely unsure about everything how to disclose if I should disclose right now or what. He then said “you’re eventually going to have to tell me-you should just tell me now” and I just knew it was now or never. He’s right I shouldn’t waste anymore of his time. 


I told him everything while crying and he held my hand. It was the most terrifying yet freeing thing I’ve ever done. He stayed quiet and listened to me tell the story. He just replied it’s okay while rubbing my hand, he even knew that you’re less like to transmit when you’re not having an outbreak. I educated him on everything I knew about transmission rates and everything and made sure he knew that the risk wasn’t zero. He was fine with it. He said that he was thankful I told him and we hugged I cried some more and we fell asleep cuddling.


He didn’t view me differently he didn’t treat me any different. He said “don’t you feel better now that you told me” and he was 1000% right. It was the first time in months I felt normal I felt comfortable I can’t describe to you how much lighter I feel. 


I can’t tell you your experience will be the same, but I figured posting this would help someone just like all the other posts helped me. There’s no way to know how they will react. But assuming the worst only hurts yourself. I was so locked in my head about this and I thought anyone I told would look at me like I was used, dirty, or gross. And that’s not the case. You are everything you were before your diagnosis or assault you are more than how people treat you. Having this doesn’t make you any less of a person or any less desirable. To my ladies you are beautiful and completely deserving of all love and care. To everyone in here - life goes on, there will be people who are understanding and will see beyond this skin condition. You are still a real person. You are still human and you deserve every bit of happiness this life has to offer. Sending everyone love and strength.

The right help makes a world of difference,"Diagnosed about a year ago. It was devastating at the moment and didn’t have to be. 
The “doctor” (using quotes because she does not deserve the implied respect of the title) who diagnosed me was awful. Shamed me, made me feel disgusting, physically recoiled, and left me in a flood of tears without the confidence to ask some much needed questions.
Lurked on this sub and tried to change my attitude. Found a bunch of remedies beyond prescriptions to manage my systems that truly made the world of difference over the past year. Helped me embrace myself again and find some of my old confidence.

Last week I finally made it in to a new office for a prescription (previous “doctor” ran out before I could process the diagnosis let alone get treatment)

The experience was night and day. She was kind, understanding, and incredibly helpful. I was finally able to have a discussion without tears. Now that I’m medicated my viewpoint is completely changed and I realize what a truly small inconvenience this is and just how overblown the stigma is.

I really just wanted to share my experience in case anyone else was made to feel less than bc of their diagnosis. Shamers are wrong and uninformed. Don’t let them stop you from getting help you need.

Warrior Spirit Says Hello To Other Warrior Spirits,"Hi all. 24y/o queer F/NonBinary. I've been following this sub for about 6mo after being diagnosed in April 2021 w GHSV1 or GHSV2 and thought it was time to say hello and share some. When I was swabbed they only told me I was HSV positive, and didn't specify which type even after I requested the specificity (most practitioners don't find this an important distinction). 

I had my first breakout directly after getting the covid vaccine, which sent my immune system for a whirl. I suspect that I contracted HSV from my current partner or the person that him and I had a 3sum with this last year. However, I noticed prodome/flu symptoms before the 3sum, and after seeing him exclusively. He only has had one oral outbreak that I am aware of and he broke out right after I broke out genitally for the first time. It is hard to understand who had it first and from where it originated. I have worked hard to not fixate on its origin, because such is energy demanding, but the past year of having this has caused me to face real suffering, met with little concern or support from partner who I am living with.

My symptoms post-outbreak #1 have been very mysterious, perception altering, and difficult to face on my own. I am going to share some of what I have felt in hopes to relate to someone or add to a wealth of knowledge. I haven't broken out into complete sores since the first time (which was around 3-4 sores total) but I have experienced intense viral/prodome? type symptoms back to back for about a year, basically spinning me into a fit of desperate/borderline hypochondriac investigation, going to tons of doctors visits and the er twice. The symptoms did not come with sores, so it was almost impossible to understand if something else was going on, or how a viral disease could wreak such havoc on a very healthy, young person. In 2018 my senses altered a bit after developing visual snow and POTS syndrome (due to combination of an eating disorder and compacted use of psychedelics (LSD specifically)) - some would refer to it as HPPD. Since then, the onset of herpes has caused my visual center to sort of hyperact - and what would for some be an intense anxiety attack, for me becomes a depersonalized hyperreality (imagine a high definition television screen plus static) with a very ""nowhere and no-one is safe"" type environment, especially my own body. The worst of this was brought on by a night of drinking and going out, which I cannot really do anymore. And since has decreased with further proximity away from the onset of this plus deep spiritual work to ground myself in this reality. More basic symptoms include - headaches, nausea, deep fatigue, chest pains/minor myocarditis, nerve discomfort/constant agitation, waves of light headedness/dizziness, lack of appetite, pain in lymph nodes in the groin, cramps, leg pain, and the accompanying anxiety/emotional distress that comes along with this. These symptoms will only really spread out a couple weeks at a time (seem to be in line with hormonal changes) and have varying degrees. Not all symptoms are always happening at once but sometimes they are. And when they reach a height, a small ""papercut"" type feeling appears genitally and quickly disappears. Herp saying whatsup player. 

I am very conscious of most knowledge on herpes, what to do and not do, and have altered my life to fit this accordingly. I am extremely healthy and active when this isn't defeating me. I use Chinese and herbal medicines generally and have tried a combination of things that generally haven't shown me true success yet. My current cocktail is B12, Liposomal vitamin C, L-lysine, the informal use of medicinal mushrooms (non psychedelic), herbal teas, and plant based diet with animal products infused. I've moved away from arginine rich diet recently and am drinking a ton of water, sleeping normally, and basically no drinking or staying out all night. Antivirals do basically nothing for me and I have read a lot about the benefits of letting your system fight on its own. I have support from family who live out of town and friends nearby. My mind is strong but this hurts me deeply. My biology is suffering. I get glimpses of how I used to feel every now and then and it pains me constantly to accept this new reality. I do it anyway.

Am hoping to have some insight into my weird symptoms.,"I recently had protected sex and unprotected oral sex about 5 weeks ago. 

The morning after I did feel a little nauseous and dizzy but this could have been from drinking a few beers and not getting much sleep. 

4 days later I felt a slightly burning sensation on mainly one side of my shaft. Only when it brushed up against my underwear or squeezed against my leg.  The thing is I also sprayed tea tree oil in that spot. Diluted with water but now am aware that’s not enough. And it needs to be diluted with a carrier oil. This slight burning went on for a week. Went away. Then returned for a day or so. 

Later on I also felt a burning sensation on a different part of the shaft. And a sharp temporary sting in the same area two separate times.  I wasn’t sure if it was from pubic hair growing and poking the other side. But it felt a little too intense for that.  And also a slight sting in my urethra 4 weeks after the encounter. 

On and off the first two weeks I had a minor headache that would go away in a few hours. And a slight ache in my groin or thighs. And a feeling of restless leg syndrome in my legs at some point. But I’ve also been laying in bed depressed for a while so I thought it may be due to lack of movement. 

Also had an itchiness at the head of my penis and slightly down the shaft for two days about a week ago.. This almost felt like a yeast infection even though I’ve never really had one. I’ve had a small red dot on the side of the head for a month now that has not gone away at all as well. It looks like what balanitis would look like. But only one dot. 

Fast forward a week later and I noticed a small red quarter of an inch spot on the lower part of the shaft. With maybe a little blister on it. But incredibly hard to tell. I noticed this spot also in another location a week before. The second time it happened I showed it to my primary care doctor and even though it was barely visible he quickly said it’s probably herpes. This doctor has been quick to shame me about not using the proper protection though. So I honestly can’t tell if he’s just trying to scare me. And jump to conclusions. 

And it very well may be. But it has since pretty much disappeared in 2 days. I also put cream on it used for oral cold sores though. 

The girl I saw also admitted she does get cold sores. So I am wondering what my risks are. I got a blood test again at this 5 week mark. And I know that’s barely going to be 50% accurate. But I also had unprotected sex 9 weeks ago. So hopefully I can get some kind of answer. 

Also is it possible to spread genital herpes from someones hand to the penis?  
At this point I’m trying to just assume I have it so I’m not hurt too much by the results. 

But am confused that I have had on and off symptoms for a month. And no consistent ulcers. Only small red spots that come and go within a day or two.",tf3tun,1,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tf3tun/am_hoping_to_have_some_insight_into_my_weird/,2022-03-15 19:44:12-04:00
Anyone have weird body changes since diagnosis?,"After diagnosis I’ve have so many changes occur to my body. Nothing feels the same. I have an increase in body hair everywhere. My eye lashes and eyebrows have gotten thicker. 

I have hella acne, but I also haven’t been taking care of my skin as much due to depression, but my skin has never been this broken out.
 
It’s subtle but it’s enough for me to notice. I’ve been getting rashes on my legs. I developed seborrheic dermatitis on my face and scalp. 

Skin is way more sensitive all over. 

I developed that darkened line women get on their stomach when they’re pregnant.(Which would be impossible)

I’ve had recurring oral thrush and sensitive bleeding gums. 

And I keep have eye flashes, so much so I was worried that my retina was detaching it something. Got my eyes checked and they are fine.

Satisfied to finally have gHSV-2 confirmed after being doubted by doctors.,"I **finally** had my genital herpes confirmed and wanna say ""I told you so"" to every medical staff I talked to about it.

TLDR; ranting/venting because nurses told me I probably didn't have herpes and now I've proved them wrong.

I was exposed in August of last year and had a three week period with \*very\* clear symptoms.  
Fast forward to two months later when I had the same experience but for two weeks and milder intensity. I've had sporadic symptoms on and off inbetween and after those periods, but never any outbreaks. Most docs and nurses I met said it wasn't herpes as I didn't have any blisters,  but couldn't tell me what it would be otherwise. But my symptoms were clearly there! And they wouldn¨'t test me only based on symptoms. I even had this doctor calling bullshit but still gave me aciclovir because I told her I ordered a home test kit and tested positive for type 1 and 2 antibodies.

Come January, I had two or three tiny and painful open sores on my labia. Can't remember if I felt any symptoms beforehand. I got them swabbed and it came back negative.   
Last week I found a similar tiny blister that hurt the same way, but not as much. The nurse questioned me at first as I hadn't felt symptoms this time. She also doubted it because there was only one bilster that ""didn't look like herpes and it would've been *sooo* painful if it were."" I asked her to swab it anyway to at least rule it out and made a point of how much the herpes thing initially tore me apart mentally. She finally did it and **tadaa!** Got the letter today that said I had tested positive for HSV-2. TOLD YOU!

So now I've got to wait until I get to his hotel and go out with him tonight to tell him and he probably thinks sex is definitely on the cards because we've met up a few times and had a bit of a fumble last time we hung out. I should have probably said something then but I knew it wasn't going to go further that time so I didn't.

i get outbreaks for months at a time,"i’m (19F) not exactly sure who gave me HSV-2 or when i contracted it. I think i have narrowed it down to my ex boyfriend when i was about 17. i had spent about a year and a half being in constant pain and itching and had just assumed i was getting yeast infections because my mother told me they were common in our family. 
in october of this year my symptoms were becoming so bad i got tested and got diagnosed. 

It was usually just a burning/ intense itching on the inside of my vagina but it would subside for a couple days and return a week later. only once have a ever gotten one of the little bubbles that look like pimples and with my luck it popped up right on the skin above my clit :). 

my symptoms have gotten so bad that i can’t focus on anything. i can’t walk around for too long. i can’t sleep. i sometimes have to call out of work/ leave early because the pain and itching is so intense. I’m pretty healthy and in good shape. i try to avoid anything that’ll stress me out because i think that’s a trigger although it’s hard to tell since i have them so frequently and the last so long. my last outbreak lasted from august to november and before that it was a constant thing.

i’m currently pregnant and i don’t know if the hormones are making it worse or something but i desperately need to figure out a way to keep this under control. the pain has become a very serious problem for me and it’s taking a toll on my quality of life. i know that might sound dramatic but i have a very low threshold and i’m already hormonal as all hell.

Quick back story, I have GHSV1, I got it off my boyfriend when I was 16. I’m now 35, didn’t have any outbreaks again until this January! Anyway, the OB was all around my anus (so pleasant). But since then, the skin where the OB occurred has been very sensitive and gets red and itchy easily. Worse if I scratch it. I’ve been putting sudocrem on which does help a bit. 
Has anyone else experienced this? It also looks like I’ve got a bit of scarring from it too. 

Thanks!",tensox,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tensox/sensitive_skin_after_herpes_ob/,2022-03-15 08:26:05-04:00
Receiving Oral with GHSV1,"I (25F) really clicked with this guy (27) over the weekend. He is so lovely I got invested and decided to disclose within two days of talking to him. He was very respectful and open, and he’s cautious. He said he loves to give oral, and wonders if he would be safe from transmission. 

I recently started taking valacyclovir daily for suppression, and I haven’t had an outbreak in over three years (since my initial outbreak). I told him the rate of transmission is never zero, but it’s darn close. I don’t want him to do something he’s not comfortable with just because he likes me so much. None of my past partners have cared in the slightest, or had any issues at all. 

Are there any good resources talking about GSV1 transmission? He’s researching for himself as much as possible and I’d like to help him.",tenkyq,1,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tenkyq/receiving_oral_with_ghsv1/,2022-03-15 08:13:46-04:00
Feeling torn. Looking for information (and advice),"This is a throwaway account because I am in a situation that I never expected to be in, my emotions have been all over the place, and I need to talk frankly about the situation but I really can't get advice from people IRL. This will be a long post, so here goes.

I'm a 21-year-old Christian woman and I just starting dating a 24-year-old guy who, while not actively religious himself at the moment, was raised in the same religion as me and understands and respects my choice to remain celibate until marriage. (I only bring up the religion thing to provide an explanation as to why we haven't engaged in sexual activity yet). We've been seeing each other for about six weeks and made it official two weeks ago. He was my first kiss and he's my first boyfriend so I don't really know what I'm doing, but I know I really like him and I don't want to break up with him.

Last night, he was driving me back to my apartment after we had a really great evening together, when he got really serious all of a sudden. He said he had something he needed to tell me. It took him a few minutes to say it because he was trying not to get too emotional, but basically he contracted genital herpes about two years ago. He says that the symptoms are mostly entirely managed now and he takes medicine for it regularly, but that this is something that he'll have the rest of his life. He told me that if this is something that is a dealbreaker for me, he wants me to break up with him now rather than later when we get even more emotionally attached to each other. He said he would accept whatever I chose, and that I could take a few days or even weeks to come to a decision. 

I really appreciate that he would disclose this to me, but I've been in tears on and off all day whenever I try to think about the situation. To clear my head, I just decided to learn more about herpes so I can make a truly informed decision. I know that there's a degree of ""following your heart"" that needs to happen in making relationship decisions, but I also want to know what the facts are and I'm struggling to find the statistics about how contagious herpes is and how many people with herpes have severe symptoms. 

So far I'm able to find demographic statistics about how widespread herpes is (way more common than I expected!) and I've also learned that many if not most people with herpes have no symptoms at all (which was also surprising to me--just goes to show you how stigmatized herpes really is), but I'm having trouble finding clear statistics about transmission rates based on a variety of factors (condom usage vs unprotected sex, gender, length of time since infection, whether or not sores are present, etc.). A comment under an old post in this subreddit gave me a bit of hope that this ""highly contagious"" virus wouldn't necessarily be something I'd be guaranteed to contract on the honeymoon, as I had previously thought ([https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/lub00d/comment/gppz33y/?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/lub00d/comment/gppz33y/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)[utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/lub00d/comment/gppz33y/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)). But I'm having trouble finding what study this user is referring to.

I know that if we ever got to the point where we were seriously considering marriage, I would need to come to terms with the fact that I'll probably get infected at some point. So even though we're a long way from that level of commitment, I'm worried if I decide to stay with him, I'll be essentially risking my own sexual health and the health of any kids I would want to have. But if I leave him now, I'm worried I'll be losing a potentially fantastic life partner over a condition that would actually be super manageable down the road. We're obviously early enough in our relationship that there could be plenty of other reasons we break up before we even have sexual contact, but I agree with him that it would be best to make a decision now about this particular issue.

If anyone has information (i.e., statistics and studies) that would be applicable to my situation, I would appreciate the reference. I also welcome general information about herpes, anything that would be good to know when interacting with someone who has disclosed that they have herpes. I want to make a thoughtful decision so the more I know going in, the better. Finally, I know this isn't r/relationship_advice but if anyone on this sub has been in a similar situation or has advice for this woefully inexperienced girl, I'd like to hear other people's opinions but I can't go around telling my IRLs about my boyfriend's herpes, so anecdotes and advice here are also welcome. Please don't sugarcoat anything.

TLDR: If a (female) virgin marries someone (male) who has herpes but it's been years since he contracted it and the symptoms are manageable, what are the odds that she will a) eventually contract it and b) have severe symptoms?",tehlsl,3,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tehlsl/feeling_torn_looking_for_information_and_advice/,2022-03-15 01:23:30-04:00
Western Blot Results,"My most recent IgG scores for HSV 1 and 2 were 4.90 and 1.10 respectively, with a negative supplemental test for HSV 2. My Western Blot came back negative for both HSV 1 and 2.

Constant outbreaks for 6+ months - trying to get SADBE in US,"Had ghsv2 for about 2 years now. Used to get outbreaks every few months and was manageable. I'd say since around October I've had basically a nonstop outbreak. My derm prescribed me 1g daily of valtrex yet it does nothing to stop the frequency of outbreaks. It does help with the severity though. I'll take 2g when I have a bad outbreak. I ran out of refills the other day and at the time had a very very small outbreak that was getting better and THE FIRST DAY without taking valtrex I got a bad outbreak in a new area i've never had symptoms before.

I feel like i've tried everything...except SADBE. Valtrex, supplements, elimination diet, healthier living etc. literally nothing works. Reading about SADBE is really interesting though and gives me a little bit of hope. I am in the US (Denver) and made an appointment with my derm to talk about this and even brought some studies and info I found around here but she wasn't comfortable prescribing it. She told me she would look into it but was pretty clearly not going to prescribe it.

She said because it's off-label there's a chance she could get in trouble. She recommended I go to the local universities derm office because they can prescribe off-label prescriptions without the liabilities she would have? Idk. I just completely wasted $50 though and even came prepared with studies to show her.

Buying it unofficially and making it myself kinda scares me.

OHSV1 + GHSV1 question,"Hi team! 

Long time lurker, firstly just want to acknowledge how incredible this sub has been, truely a beacon of light in an otherwise shitty situation.

I just wanted to see if anybody has had the same experience as I have. When I had my first breakout in 2018 it was both oral and genital (yay blowjobs). Had a swab on genitals and got the positive HSV1 result. 

 Since my initial outbreak in 2018 I’ve not had a single breakout oral or genitally. Currently I’ve got either a mouth ulcer or a breakout but it’s difficult to tell as my OHSV1 was never on my lips but on the inside of my mouth. 

Does this mean the virus is still active in both locations? Or is it just potentially more active in my mouth because it prefers this location?",tej1n1,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tej1n1/ohsv1_ghsv1_question/,2022-03-15 02:59:53-04:00

Today I’m deciding to get retested at a couple more labs and if they come back negative great! However, if the results are positive, “it is what is is.” I’ll make peace with it and figure out ways to cope.

loosing someone to something i seriously did not consider,"School these days never give us any information when it comes to sex education. 
I'm in high school, living life and wanting love. A week ago I had a problem and its with herpes. My boyfriend, well ex, left me after he tested positive for what I'm guessing to be genital herpes ( I still have not that much information about his side since he doesn't want to talk to me at all) and I was probably the one to give it to him. It's been hurting me a lot. Our relationship was going so great and he was happy since I was his ""first love"". My first question to all is that if this ever occurred would you have cut them out of your life entirely even your at your happiest with them? I mean I understand after a week that his anger is understandable since it was unexpected and he is a virgin. His biggest concerns was how he was gonna tell future partners. But at the same time I seriously did not know about this and I did not mean to pass it on if I do have it. Never wanted to hurt him or even loose him in this way, just hurts. Either way are we suppose to know how to be safe even when not tought? Condoms, how are they used I have no clue. 
Anyways, it hurts to think i could have been the reason i gave someone herpes. And mostly if it's their genitals. I hear it can be painful for the first few weeks. School doesn't teach me and neither does my family since I live in a strict household  in which the only thing that is told to us ladies is to not have sex till marriage.

Partner did no disclose the fact they get cold sores," 

Whats going on. 30s/m/usa here. I've been with my girlfriend since 2019. After so many failed relationships and issues (cultural stuff and I wasn't exactly the smoothest guy when I was younger) Recently moved in. I'm sure people will say ""everyone has it"" or etc but as of 2019 I had no HSV-1 or 2 antibodies and **I told my partner this at the beginning of the relationship,** and she claimed she was also a-ok even after I mentioned herpes (as I know most panels dont include it). Generally a condom user, visually will check out stuff during the heat of the moment if its a one night stand (yes not full proof, but if no sores/lesions + condom, chances are at least lowered extremely) and I don't receive oral willy nilly.

Maybe I lucked all during my 20s out or it was my diligence. Fast forward to about 72 hours ago and my gf is having oral outbreak, red /inflamed/blisters. I'm sure she noticed my face / posture and mentioned ""its just Herpes"" and threw in some leprosy jokes.

In short. I was vocal about my health status, and she withheld the fact that she has oral herpes outbreaks. After about 3 years of non condoms and oral sex...I possibly have hsv-1/2 orally or genitally now. Maybe I've semi lucked out and I'm part of the asymptomatic team but I fairly upset she just decided not to mention this at all. **The worst part is she works in healthcare (obgyn) so she knows he has been putting me at risk for oral/genital lesions from passing it**. Not on meds, never said a word....effectively lied to me. A few times she has had ""eczema"" around the mouth, but now I'm thinking...maybe she was breaking out, knew it, and tried to cover.

I'm sitting here thinking how she purposely lied to me  
I'm sitting here thinking at any point in the near future possible sores can appear on my mouth or penis area.  
I'm sitting here thinking about having to tell new women this, get ghosted, and be the responsible person to disclose, if antibodies come back positive.  
I'm sitting here thinking that a person I loved/trusted wouldn't have the decency to just tell me this  
I'm sitting here thinking if we break up I'll be the bad guy possibly to her friends/family

I'm curious to hear peoples ethical view point. To me consent really matters. **I wasnt even given the choice to decide if I wanted play this rodeo**. If she would have disclosed I would have been like ""do you mind getting on meds ?"" Gonna get a western blot test and not even play the IGM/IGG game.

How long after disclosing is it safe to say I was rejected?,"UPDATE: false alarm, I have not been rejected yet. He's certain he wants to continue seeing me but is considering how this will affect our sex life (as am I!)

I met someone I really like on Hinge. We chatted for a week before our first date, which went really well. We had a lot of chemistry and so much in common. We got really deep on our first date, providing our divorce/relationship backstories, our attachment styles and love languages. We're therapy and self-improvement types and we had that in common as well as our propensity to analyze and solve problems. After our first date (we kissed!) we texted non-stop until our second date last night. We had a FOUR HOUR dinner then went to an arcade bar before I suggested we go make-out at his place. We got hot and heavy for an hour or so but as soon as he tried to get into my pants I stopped him. And then just fucking blurted out ""I have herpes."" Not my smoothest moment, but I'm of the mindset that no matter how you disclose or sugar-coat it, the news is always the same. And I don't want to have to educate adult men about the statistics or sound like I'm begging or justifying in any way, but I did tell him how long I've had it and that I'm on Valtrex and currently asymptomatic. It definitely sucked the air out of the room and he told me about his herpes scare but reiterated that he doesn't have it and said something along the lines of can't risk it. So I hugged him and started gathering my things to leave, but then he pulled me back in to make out for a while longer. And it was very passionate and he was struggling to restrain himself so it didn't seem out of pity. Then he texted me to let him know when I was safely home and said he had a great time that will make for nice dreams. 

So what now? Despite being a fully-grown adult woman in her 30s with 8+ years of knowing I have herpes, I haven't disclosed much since I used to only date on PositiveSingles. I assume he's mulling it over or maybe even talking to his therapist, but he hasn't texted today and I don't want to reach out first since the ball is in his court. How many days do I give him before I delete his number and move on? ",te0hk7,5,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/te0hk7/how_long_after_disclosing_is_it_safe_to_say_i_was/,2022-03-14 11:47:22-04:00
How accurate are blood drawn tests?,"After he refused several times to get tested, I finally convinced this boy who I’m 1000% sure gave me genital herpes to get tested. He seems to be asymptomatic and possibly has no sores. I told him to get a blood drawn test, but I’ve heard so many things about it not being accurate at all. I would look extremely dumb if his test came back as a false negative, since I’m sure he gave it to me. (I have histories of tests to back it up). But I’m afraid he’ll then try to rub it in my face and tell everyone I have herpes to get back at me since he’s been angry with me for mentioning it in the first place. I can’t believe someone who has 0 symptoms is upset at me while I’m suffering the most & was trying to be transparent.

Set someone free,"31/M

I’ve now known I’ve had HSV-2 for about a year now and it was a long journey to get to this point where if I think about the fact that I have HSV-2, I don’t analyze it as if it were a huge problem in my life. And here’s why…

If you know you have G-HSV, you should get on Valtrex right away even if you don’t have symptoms. This is because if you take Valtrex AND use a condom, the transmission rate becomes 1.9%.

The facts are that 1 out of every 6 Americans have HSV-2, roughly 17% of the country or 56 million people (think about that for a second). Of those 56 million people we know that 90% of them will never know they have G-HSV either from negligence or they are asymptomatic and would have no reason to believe they have G-HSV.

With this in mind, that means there’s a much higher chance of contracting G-HSV from someone who says “yes, I’ve been tested and I’m clean” (they don’t know they’re “clean” because doctors don’t screen for G-HSV) than there is from someone who knows they have G-HSV but they take Valtrex and wear condoms.

Hope this sets someone free.",tdvm63,7,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tdvm63/set_someone_free/,2022-03-14 07:45:35-04:00

DAE struggle to say no to sex with people who don't have it?,"I've had full on sex with ONE person that didn't have it since I caught it 12 years ago. 

I've fooled around with many, only one that I didn't disclose to (which I regret, as telling him right afterwards was upsetting, but we are still friends.)

I've had many men say they didn't mind, but I still said no. And that one that I did I was with for 3 years, thinking we'd be together for ever. 

I've got this guy friend and we've hit if off bizarrely well. I got drunk and fooled around with him, but we played rather safely. (He knew I had it btw) The next day he was really anxious about it. Since then he's calmed down and had talked about maybe having oral or full sex. 

I'm so torn. I don't want to spread this. I don't want to change his entire life because I'm horny and can't find someone with it (small dating pool of positive people where I live.)

We're not in a relationship, have no plans to be, so it's just... ugh. 

On top of that, I have my roommate, female, and her and I want to get physical but I'm extra scared with her. 

I'm trying to do research but here's my point:

Genital HSV1 - transmitted asymptomatically?,"Hi guys, 

I recently got diagnosed with HSV1 after having an outbreak in my genital area.  It started off with 3 sores then a group of blister/sores a couple days in.  All cleared up with meds. 

I know you can't really figure out who gave it to you for sure or how you got it but I'm female and only have sex with other women.

My current sexual partner has never had any cold sores but then realised her ex partner had cold sores but she never seemed to have the same issue. 

I was wondering is it likely that she's an asymptomatic carrier and passed this onto me through oral sex resulting in me having genital HSV1?  I just expected my results to say HSV2 given where the outbreak occurred. 

I'm kind of worried about oral sex going forward, I don't want to completely stop doing it but I feel like that is likely to cause more outbreaks?

Any advice appreciated, thank you :)",te3j9j,1,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/te3j9j/genital_hsv1_transmitted_asymptomatically/,2022-03-14 13:58:37-04:00
Turns out I don’t have herpes…,"I’ve been under the information that I have had HSV2 for the past six months. I had never had any symptoms, but had had add with a few people without a condom. What happened was one guy I slept with wanted to be with me more seriously and I said no, and then he told me that I had given him herpes. Of course I was devastated, and just assumed I had it because he had told me that he had not slept with anyone else in a long time (and I had slept with other ppl without protection). I never got tested because here in the UK they won’t test you unless you have sores. So, I am now with my wonderful bf and we have sex with protection only. Butt something about the whole situation was bothering me - how unlikely was it that I would pass on herpes to someone I slept with maybe 3 times and I had no symptoms? 

So I bought a test online for £50, and it came back negative for HSV1 and HSV2. I am so relieved because it means I can have sex with my bf without a condom. 

That being said, in a certain way I am happy I went through this experience, and therefore wanted to post this. I have such respect for ppl who go through the stigma of this virus. I had to disclose to two sexual partners that I had it and it was nervewracking but also gave me such a sense of self respect. Self love is so much more than what other people think of you. And if the person is right, they will not care about you having herpes. 

On another note though - would you confront the person who lied to you? Bare in mind they were really upset when I ended things, I genuinely think they had malicious intent in telling me I gave them herpes.",tdx8rr,3,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tdx8rr/turns_out_i_dont_have_herpes/,2022-03-14 09:14:16-04:00

Does every girl I have spontaneously sex with just have to accept that she might get infected? And does my future partner just have to accept that she will end up getting it?

Hand herpes?,"Hey all, so I tested positive for HSV-1 and I've been racking my brain to see if Ive ever shown symptoms. 

I've never had a breakout on my mouth or genitals, but looking back I think I may have had something going on with my hands. 

Once when I was a kid, my entired hands started shedding skin. I'm not talking about small dandruff flakes, I mean big thick patches of skin, no blisters though. I always assumed it was from playing wayyyyy too many video games at the time. I never said anything and my parents never noticed. 

Another time like 5 years ago, I worked at a factory with a lot of chemicals. One day I developed a rash on the back of my hand. It was itchy at first, and eventually developed into clusters of blisters that burst (can't remember if I burst them or if it happened on its own) They kind of hurt too. I went to a doctor and he just assumed it was a chemical burn from what I told him. He gave me some type of cream and they went away after a few weeks. Not sure if the medicine had anything to do with it. 

I also noticed the back of my hands seems to dry out at times and I develop small blisters that really itch. I've mostly noticed it during cold weather , but maybe that was just my brain looking for a cause. 

How common is hand herpes? Do any of y'all have it? Do my symptoms sound like this could be what's going on? I don't really take too good care of my skin either.",te09bq,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/te09bq/hand_herpes/,2022-03-14 11:37:02-04:00

I can’t stop crying,"I was finally making peace with my diagnosis and now I’m starting to worry about having some sort of other incurable disease.

 I’m worried that I might have lichen sclerosis which is terrifying to me. I don’t want sex to be painful and I don’t want the possibility of my genitals disappearing. I’m so frustrated and I’m having such a meltdown it’s making it hard to work on this paper I have due soon. I’m just tired. 

Ever since my diagnosis I have had so many different changes going on to my body and it has caused me to panic. Since my diagnosis I’ve had about SIX different health scares and possible illness. All supposedly unrelated to herpes, but guess what? I didn’t start having any of these symptoms until my first outbreak. 🙃 I don’t even blame the herpes at this point and I would honestly be elated to find out that this is the only problem. I swear if I get checked out and have confirmation that it’s just herpes I’ll be able to move on with my life. I will be grateful! 

For clarity, I have been officially diagnosed with HSV1 via swab. But I’m concerned because my labia has began to lighten in color, and one side of my labia has drooped lower than the other. This all happened during the beginning of my first OB in December and it still looks like this. I was told by a nurse that it would eventually go back to normally but now I’m not so sure. I’m worried because from what I’ve seen the symptoms of a herpes OB and LS or very similar. Also my herpes symptoms are atypical which complicates things....

During the first OB I had bumps on my labia that were swabbed...

As my OB progressed, I noticed tiny tears on my anus, which I believed to be the herpes outbreak. I only notice them when using the bathroom and they itch and sting a little and make it sensitive to wipe. It heals really fast.

I’ve now learned that is also a symptom of LS.

My friends are acting like I can’t casually date with herpes,"For context, my (22F) thing this year is that I’m not going to get into a serious relationship because I want to experience being single and developing my hobbies. 
For the past four months, I’ve been casually dating (swiping on dating apps, going on a few in person dates, a couple of hookups), but nothing serious. Was recently diagnosed with genital herpes and I told my close friends (20-22FM) about it. They were accepting, they asked me questions, I gave them answers. I thought the conversation went well and they understood that it wasn’t the end of my life, I could have a normal love life and just be upfront/disclose and take precautions. 
Then today I sent a screenshot from Hinge (complaining about what the guy was saying, unrelated to my diagnosis) and suddenly it was this big like “well maybe you should stop dating for right now/etc”. The only thing that has changed is my diagnosis. I called them out for it and was pretty much like “I’m still not getting into a serious relationship, but I can exist as a HSV+ person outside of a serious relationship”. They apologized, but it made me feel so crummy. 

Has anyone else had this experience?? Finally got over the initial shock of “I have to be in a serious relationship for anyone to accept my status” and they kind of knocked that down and now I feel like I shouldn’t be casually dating or even on the apps.

Rejection after disclosure advice,"I (25F) recently got back into dating after ending a long term, rather toxic  relationship. The thought of having to disclose my HSV2 status to new potential partners was always my nightmare. It’s honestly a reason why I stayed in my previous relationship longer than I should have, to avoid this confrontation. I felt like no one else would accept me. However, I started talking to this guy on bumble a few weeks ago. We really hit it off after a FaceTime date, so I decided to disclose to him my positive HSV2 status. He was initially super nice about it and we ended up meeting in person. Night went on, and after fooling around a bit (no sex), he seemed very apprehensive about my HSV2 status. I completely understood if he was nervous, and wanted to respect his boundaries/anxieties. Aside from that we had a really good rest of the night. We texted sparingly the next day, but I haven’t heard from him since. Additionally, I saw that he unmatched me on bumble. I just can’t help but feel that my HSV2 was the main factor in this.

This is the worst,"My body is sooo over this. I have HSV2 and I have had nonstop prodrome symptoms for several weeks now with it getting worse.

People with GHSV (1 or 2) and vaginas—anyone have experience with recurrent UTIs/ yeast infections accompanying outbreaks?,"This is basically what it says on the title. 

I’ve been diagnosed for just over a year and even on a daily dose of Valacyclovir still have regular outbreaks, likely as my immune system is not very good to begin with, even without the antivirals. 

I’m hoping that as the years go by I’ll have fewer outbreaks, but recently have been having additional symptoms—recurrent UTIs and some trouble with yeast infections that seem to coincide with outbreaks

Managing the yeast infections in particular is getting expensive as the OTC creams and whatnot are not covered by my insurance. 

Has anyone had experience managing these symptoms concurrently with outbreaks? 

Were there any lifestyle changes (like to clothing, activity, hygiene/ bathing routine, diet, etc) that helped manage yeast infections with HSV? 

I’m at a loss for what to do—initially I just kind of continued with “life as normal” with my outbreaks, and I’ve been lucky to have relatively non-painful lesions. 

But this is starting to be totally inconvenient. 

Idk if I need to give up on skinny jeans or say goodbye to denim entirely, buy new underwear, exercise in looser clothing, etc. 

I just know I can’t cope with a monthly outbreak that seems like now it’s inherently tied to a UTI/ yeast infection—and my doctor’s take on it has just been “well, you’re on the meds, and I can give you a standing order for antibiotics too!”",tdpymu,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tdpymu/people_with_ghsv_1_or_2_and_vaginasanyone_have/,2022-03-14 01:22:52-04:00

I ended up with HSV later down the line. I hated her, to be honest. Every time I tried to tell her, she’d tell me to just leave her alone and that I was obsessed with her.

Igm vs igg,"Hi! I see a lot of talk in here saying that igm tests aren’t accurate? I tested positive for hsv1 val 1.4 igm test but tested negative for hsv1  val .38 igg test and negative for hsv 2 both tests with much lower val. According to the internet though testing positive for igm and negative for igg could mean it’s a recent infection. I also have been tested pretty regularly for hsv1 and hsv2 with my full std tests for years and always tested negative. Looked through all of my records. Not sure if it’s my doctor or location because I also see that it’s not common for that to be included in testing. But that could make sense for it being a recent infection and showing positive for igm and not igg?
Also, I just developed 2 sores inside my cheek on one side. Nowhere else inside or outside my mouth. Popped up one day after having Pfizer as my booster shot, had Moderna the other 2 shots with no issues except sore arm.

gHSV1 and Transmission,"Hello,

I am a 23 year old man and just got diagnosed with gHSV1.  I think I’m on the tail end of my first outbreak. 

I have a question about transmission.  From what I have learned about online, it seems that genital HSV1 is somewhat easier to manage and has less of a chance of asymptotic transmission than HSV2 does.  I’m curious if anyone who has had this for a while has some insight on what the transmission likelihood is of me passing it to someone who doesn’t have it if I’m not presenting symptoms.

Also, I’ve gotten a lot of mixed advice on whether or not HSV1 is something that needs to be disclosed.  Obviously my doctor advised me to disclose, but I have family members with gHSV1 who said they have never disclosed unless they’ve been in a relationship, as they would just choose to not have sex if they were having an outbreak.  Just looking for some advice on this new lifestyle.  Thanks in advance",tdikac,2,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tdikac/ghsv1_and_transmission/,2022-03-13 18:40:59-04:00

How do I safely have physical intimacy with a partner who has herpes?,"There’s quite a background story to all this, but, I’ll deal with the backlash. I’ll also give an abbreviated version. I am married and I met a man here on Reddit. He is also married. We were physically intimate once and it was truly amazing. We share very strong feelings for one another and will be seeing one another again. 

After we were physically intimate, he disclosed that he did std testing and it showed hsv1 positive for the first time ever. He retested, and indeed he is positive for hsv1. His wife, of many years is hsv2 positive so he regularly tests. They do not use condoms, but are only intimate when she isn’t showing symptoms. Of course, I thought it must’ve have been me. Although I’ve never tested positive. I had also never been with another man outside of my marriage. I did my full std testing and everything was/is normal. 

Please don’t judge me on my choices, you don’t know my complete situation. I do not by any means want to contract something, nor pass anything to my husband. I know the safest thing to do is break things off. So, please don’t tell me that. 

I will be seeing this man again and we both know what the results are. I have so many questions. This man is incredible and I don’t want his results to negatively impact our situation. 

Can we be physically intimate? I know I can’t kiss him on the lips. What about kissing other parts of the body? Cheeks? Neck? Oral sex will not happen. What about vaginal sex with a condom? I’ve read about skin to skin contact can cause transmission, but is that through saliva only? Can I even safely hold his hand?

HSV exposure vs infection," I read somewhere that HSV IgG tests arent always too accurate and you can get western blot for second confirmation, but above 3.5, there is little to no chance of a false positive. But I also read that igG test just tells that you either have an active infection, or were just ""exposed"" to the virus in the past. Is it possible for one to be exposed to either HSV or some other virus that results in the same antibodies, and NOT get infected? That is, can the virus make contact but the body's response makes it not infect any cells, not enter the body? Also, would a blood PCR test be accurate for confirmation? I can't get western blot here.   


 I recently got my HSV Igg and IgM tests. Apparently, this one doesn't mention the type, just gives the numbers. IgG 4.59 and IgM 0.50. I decided to get the test because a few weeks after a one night stand I noticed some tingling in the tip of my penis and some time after that itching on different areas of my body, but that feels more like a fungal issue.   


I live in a developing country in south Asia, people aren't really knowledgable about herpes, as it doesn't seem to be too common, or maybe just never gets reported. I wanted to get married soon and now this has turned my life upside down, I just want to cry, even with all the belief that it's common and not too problematic I can't calm myself down. Doctor I showed the test to said that I was infected in the past and that I can't pass it now as I don't have any symptoms. That's not true, I will be visiting another doctor soon. I know exposure and infection are different terms, but is it possible in case of hsv that you get exposed and not carry the virus?   


I could live with the symptoms my whole life, but the idea of giving it to someone else just makes me want to kill myself.",td9g5d,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/td9g5d/hsv_exposure_vs_infection/,2022-03-13 11:38:18-04:00

Igg negative result credibility after 15 weeks?,"Hi. Male 30.
About 17 weeks ago (mid November) I was having sex several times with a random girl for a period of two weeks. Only with condom except for oral she gave me withot condom (Also fingered her and all..).
About 15 weeks ago (end of November), after feeling stinginess in the penis urethra opening I saw it become red and one white blister that turned to two.
I went straight to a dermatologist that immediately said it's herpes. Gave me valtrex for 7 days and some antibacterial creme. After about 4 days the blisters passed. 
About 2-3 weeks after I finished the blisters (December) and the valtrex, I felt stinginess in my finger and that evening began a honeycomb rash that lasted for 4 days without special treatment (I only applied the same antibacterial creme I had from before) until it passed. 
After looking online a lot I am pretty confident it was herpetic whitlow.
Since the beginning, the penis stayed very sensitive for the next two months (If I touched it or tried to masturbate the skin would go red, sensitive and uncomfortable).
I was at the dermatologist two weeks ago (beginning of March) for checkup and everything is pretty ok but I showed him pictures of the finger and he said it's hard to tell but anyway I was sent to do IGg test which I did few days ago and got the results today.
The results were negative for both hsv1 and hsv2. 

I am very confused and buffled.
How should I react to it? What are the chances that its a false negative? Or perhaps I am misleading myself to think I have herpes when I actually don't? I would really appreciate any input.

Considering relocating to a state with larger HSV2 population,"Rant, not looking for advice 

I am in a place I have always dreaded. When I was first diagnosed, I’d get on dating sites specifically for HSV2 & I’d see so many singles with it who were in their 50-60’s and thought dear god, I hope I’m not going to be one of those. Well here I am. Still single, having a much harder time to date or even get laid because of it. Everyone my age is either still married or doesn’t have it. Do I have to wait until there are more widowers? Or date much younger men? That I would be ok with, I seem to attract them from dating sites but the minute they hear HSV2, they are gone. Even though I put it in my profile. When I ask if they read the not so fine print, they don’t even know what it is. 

I moved here 17 years ago (Oklahoma City) from a small town. Mostly due to work but the hope I might find love. I had more sex in the small town, mostly men from neighboring states.

Question about Squirting Safety and Herpes,"Hi guys,

I have a new sexual partner that has herpes. She was very open about it with me before anything happened between us.

We discussed it through, and I realized that as long as she doesn't have an outbreak and I use a condom, the risk is very minimal. However, during our first encounter, although we used a condom, we got lost in the moment during foreplay, and she squirted allover, including on my crotch. 

I didn't think about this as a potential risk until afterwards. And now I've begun to  wonder if it's possible for her fluids to give me the virus without penetration.

Am I overthinking this? Should I get tested and be more careful next time?

Request for Advice and Support,"Hey everyone, as I'm waiting for my appointment to get tested, I wanted to ask for advice and support. I was just broken up with by someone and here is the story. I apologize in advance for the lengthy post, but I wanted to expose all of the details.


A month ago on a dating app I met a very very beautiful person, seemingly inside and out. Our values were aligned, our communication was stellar, and we genuinely enjoyed each other's company. After about a week and a half we became intimate. Prior to any activity, I asked if he was clean. He said ""yes, are you?"" I had just been tested with negative results for everything and said ""yes"". Halfway through, the condom was removed and then without communication or consent, he came in me. This bothered me and we discussed it and agreed it wouldn't happen again.


A week later after several other unprotected (with consent) events, my partner asked to talk to me. He said it would be serious and that he expected me to leave him. I was concerned and went into it with an open heart; I genuinely enjoy supporting people and wanted to be there for him. 


During our talk he started by saying he was an alcoholic. This seemed odd to me because he rarely drinks and he admitted ""that's what everyone says when I tell them"". I admitted that I didn't understand and asked why he drank. He said ""I had a partner that got me hooked on drinking. She also got me hooked on a medicine. A medicine that I have to take to feel clean that also makes me very depressed."" I wasn't following and pressed for more information. 


After about 10 minutes of elusive conversation, he admitted that two years ago he tested positive for genital HSV1 (but he didn't seem sure if it was actually 1 or 2). I remained supportive and believed him when he said that taking the pill once a week would prevent him from transmitting it to me. I really had never considered herpes to be lifelong. In my ignorance I thought it was something you experienced a few outbreaks of and that then went into remission with a healthy immune system. 


After doing more research, I felt deceived. I knew without a doubt that when I asked him if he was clean, that the first word that came to his mind was Herpes. But instead of disclosing this to me he still said he was clean. I confronted him about this and he apologized profusely, saying he didn't know it could be passed on without an occurring outbreak; that he genuinely believed he was clean. I sent him the peer reviewed scientific papers explaining otherwise and we discussed it in a very calm and understanding manner. 


At no time did I ever shame him or get angry at him for anything other than avoiding the truth when I asked him if he was clean before having unprotected sex. I forgave him and we continued to be intimate, but things felt different. He always wanted to remove the condom, to have sex more and more. We had an argument about something unrelated to herpes and he asked me if he had ever given me a reason not to trust him. I brought up not disclosing that he had herpes when I asked if he was clean. 


He proceeded to stand up, grab his keys, and walk out. He sent me a few voice messages saying that he couldn't be with someone who made him feel unworthy of touch and who made him feel unclean. He said ""I hope to God you don't have it, but I can't do this"". I felt awful, but also relieved. He is a model and made it clear earlier in the relationship that he can be with anyone, and that all of his friends who are girls would sleep with him given the chance. I had definitely felt stress because of this comment and I think regardless of Herpes it would not have lasted.


So at this point I am waiting for my appointment to get tested. I feel deceived and scared. I love meaningful relationships and value closeness, communication, and honesty. But I feel like prey because of my empathy and altruism.


TLDR; After several weeks of unprotected sex, my partner disclosed that they knew they had genital Herpes for two years. They told me they were clean prior to sexual activity. After a month, he broke up with me. Feeling deceived and uncertain.",td9c03,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/td9c03/request_for_advice_and_support/,2022-03-13 11:32:28-04:00
"Any long-term, discordant couples here? Please talk to me.","Hi, all. 40+ year old male here. My girlfriend of 7 months is gHSV2 positive and I am not. (We are both HSV1 negative.) I was aware of her status before entering into the relationship and I did not want it to be a deal breaker for me, because I really wanted this to work. She has had it over 3 years, has never had an outbreak since her first, and takes antivirals daily. 

I understand that my risk is ""low"". It took me a while to come to this understanding, and for the first 5 months of our relationship we were extremely cautious in our sexual activities. Even though everything was fantastic between us, this was a great source of anxiety for me. Then in month 6 I got more comfortable, accepted that ""risk is low”, and we stopped using protection, agreeing that we would simply abstain (or play in “safe” ways) whenever she thought she might be feeling any prodrome signs. My anxiety subsided and things were going great. 

Then I had a health scare, and for a solid week and a half I (and she) 100% believed that I had contracted gHSV2. The details of that health scare are not relevant so I won’t go into that. Point is I don’t have it, but now I know how I would feel if I were to get it. I was not prepared for it. I have dealt with depression and anxiety before, but this was a level of existential devastation I had not dared to imagine. And amongst the darkness I felt regret.

I love my partner. I was not upset with her. I had accepted the risk. But now that I’ve been given this strange gift of knowing how I would feel if I got it, I don’t think I can accept the risk anymore. I want to have carefree sex with the person I love, without the anxiety of constantly wondering “is this the time I’ll get it?”, and that just doesn’t seem realistic anymore. 

I have been reading and re-reading all I can find on the topic. I realize we could be together for years without me getting it, or I could get it next week. I’d really like to hear real life experiences from people who are or have been part of a discordant couple, where gHSV2 is concerned. How long have/had you been together? Was gHSV2 transmitted eventually or not? If so, how much time passed before it was transmitted? Did the relationship last? How did all of these things make you feel, or how did your feelings change? I know there are people out there who have been in my position and gone through it, and I feel it would be so helpful for me to hear what their experiences are, rather than relying solely on numbers and odds derived from what few studies are out there. (Although those are certainly helpful too.) I am seeking more perspectives.

I had a bloodtest 2 years ago and was HSV2+.

I'd prefer to protect her as long as possible. We had unprotected sex a couple of days ago. I was a bit itchy today on the head of my penis and had a look and saw this:

Positive for HSV1,"So its been two months since I found out that I’m positive for HSV-1. At first I was scared, shock, and disappointed in myself. But I tried to just play it off like if it was any other lifetime disease that I’m going to have to just get used to trying to down play it. Although I do know it’s something serious and it is something I disclose before doing anything else with someone but it just gets the best of me. I have so much pain from when I found out that I’ve been positive and I’ve just noticed that I started blocking out the pain and because of that I’ve been losing focus, I can’t pay attention, I can’t remember as easily as I could. I don’t know what to do I want to get back to my old self. I’m extremely paranoid now if I see anything on my lip thinking it’s an outbreak when it’s nothing then I start getting panic attacks.

First Outbreak,"Well I am in the lovely throws of my first outbreak. I am devastated to say the least. I know it’s treatable and all but I already seriously lacked sexual confidence as it was to begin with. 

Anyways: I’ve been sick for a month and a half with a sore throat. The sore throat started a month an a half ago but I didn’t have swollen tonsils or anything. I just has swollen glands in my neck. I got a fever for a day but was over it quick. Then a month & half went by where the sore throat came and went where long story short I saw the dr 4 times and they couldn’t figure out what gave me the sore throat and swollen glands bc they tested for everything. Well fast forward to this weekend.. had sex with a FWB on Sunday then started to develop aches and fatigue Mon-Tuesday Wednesday got a fever that still hasn’t gone away and that night I thought I might also be developing a yeast infection in addition to being sick. Tried treating that via OTC cream but the swelling got worse & more painful. fast forward to today (Saturday) I woke up and when I went pee it burned horribly! So I thought I better have a look down there so I grabbed a hand help mirror and sure enough I had a bunch of open blisters. Already went to urgent care today and got diagnosed just by the doctor looking at them. (They did swab too but that will take a bit to come back) 

My questions are:

1. Has me being sick for the past month & a half been due to this?

2. When do you disclose when dating? I have been single for some time and have been dating recently so I feel a big sense of doom when it comes to my future of dating

3. Will I ever be able to have sex unprotected again with someone I’ve disclosed to? TBH I hate condoms

4. What are the chances of me never having an outbreak again without having to take the antiviral? Does that happen? 

5. When will this stupid fever and body aches go away if I started meds today?

Do i tell ex’s new girl he has HSV2? He will not disclose/is in denial that he has it.,"My ex is talking to someone new, not sure for how long but at least a week (we have only been broken up for two). He is in complete denial about having genital herpes and will not disclose. He didn’t disclose to me, and has acted surprised and angry the few times I have mentioned him giving it to me. Do I tell her, or just let her either get it or not get it?
The main thing stopping me is that I don’t want it to get back to him that I “sabotaged” him as I did not want to burn the bridge, and his mental health is kind of explosive which makes me worry that if this girl messages him, asking if he has herpes or citing herpes as the reason she doesn’t want to talk to him anymore, he may harm himself, or lie to her and take it out on me (i am still living here and have no place to go for the time being. He has never been violent towards me in the past, but like I said, his mental health isn’t awesome).
I know we can’t control others. If I knew 100% she would trust me and make up her own excuse to stop talking to him, I would do it in a heartbeat.

Looking for Clinical Research and Studies regarding a couple of somewhat Niche Questions,"
Hello fellow unwitting hosts of r/Herpes,

I’ve evidently contracted gHSV2 sometime in the last ten or so days, with my first symptoms presenting on Tuesday.

I have spent easily 8 hours a day since then voraciously scouring Google Scholar, Arxiv and abusing the godsend that is SciHub.

I’ve read easily 50 papers by now.. no joke. Everything from the heavily cited classics to the cutting edge of vaccine research with gene therapies.

And yet… my somewhat unique (even “rare” apparently based on the data) circumstances leave me with many unanswered questions.  Despite exhausting my skills with search operators, excluding terms, using AND/OR statements, the whole nine yards… I haven’t been able to find a shred of research pertaining to what would seem to me as fairly obvious research questions that some PostDoc would’ve looked into somewhere at sometime… but hell, at this point I’d be happy even with just some relevant case studies!

Quick background:

- Girlfriend has **orofacial** HSV-2.  She contracted it ~2.5 years ago, hadn’t had an outbreak in a year, and this is now her 5th outbreak.  All recurrences have been exclusively on her face along trigeminal nerve - never any symptoms present on genitalia.

- We last had sex on Sunday.  She hadn’t given me oral since Friday, though we had penetrative vaginal sex over weekend.

- Tuesday morning she tells me she feels outbreak starting.  Tuesday evening I begin to experience subtle sensation on my own genitalia.  However, physical sensations of discomfort had mostly ceased by the time I went to sleep, so I chalked it up to psychosomatic phenomena.  We are assuming her outbreak was caused by beginning an SSRI medication two weeks prior, and that she had been significantly shedding prior to her first symptoms as a result.

- Wednesday midmorning I notice unmistakable physical presentation of HSV-2 on my own genitalia (male).  Surprising because there was almost zero physical sensations by this point.  However, I had already studied up plenty well to recognize what I was looking at.  Physical presentation was mild but anticipated it getting worse.

- It’s now been 72 hours since my clinical GH symptoms appeared.  No significant changes since first noticing.  No spreading, same number of blisters in the same places.  No physical discomfort or sensations of note.


So, now for the questions I’ve had zero luck finding answers too among the bio and medical literature.  I’m not sure if I’m using improper terminology, or if oral HSV-2 is rare enough that questions like mine don’t generally merit study. 

**Questions**

1.  Due to our respective anatomical regions effected, I’m not even sure if we’re technically concordant or discordant.  Regardless, seeing as I am effected genitally and she is effected on the mandible, do I now pose a significant risk of giving her a secondary (?) HSV2 infection of the same strain on her genitals?  Is there any evidence that one host can harbor the virus in two disparate nerve branches?  Or is there evidence that her immune system (she’s immunocompetent, young and healthy) shouldn’t have any problems fending off the same virus in other “new” locations of her body?

2.  As a concordant couple (assuming that is our appropriate classification), is there any research data available indicating whether me being exposed to her asymptomatic shedding episodes going forward would be a possible (or likely ?) trigger of recurrences for me?  I know oral HSV-2 typically sheds the least viral load of any other combination, as well as results in the most infrequent recurrences, but don’t know what to make of this aspect.

3. On the other hand, myself now with (perhaps mildly symptomatic gHSV2? Too soon to tell but cautiously optimistic) gHSV2, and being a male, I am statistically going to have frequent recurrences with shedding of both the physically symptomatic variety as well as asymptomatic.  Is it a significant concern that my shedding will be a trigger causing more recurrent episodes for her potentially? 

4. This last one is least critical, but still something I’ve had in my mind as a curious detail.  As I noted, the last time she had given me oral was several full days prior to her first symptoms, and even then it was very brief before we moved on to penetrative sex.  I’m aware it’s perfectly possible that saliva-to-penis contact (however brief it was) could have been the moment of contraction.  However, is oral to oral transfer possible in such a way that I would express the infection genitally?  On the same theme, does someone with oral HSV2 shed virus through vaginal fluid?


I don’t expect that these topics will have been explored in a particularly rigorous fashion as the more impactful questions receive, but I’m thinking maybe some of you folks might be able to point me to publications that have directly or indirectly touched on these questions.

I’m also not against hearing the anecdotal evidence of “lore” from the community.  Obviously that sort of information will be taken with many grains of salt, but it’s common enough that first hand experience offers meaningful insights that sometimes do get explained in the formal research later… I’ll at least take notes let’s say.  

But obviously, links to scholastic articles are what’s ideal.

You’re also welcome to suggest me search terms or just particular databases!  I’ve got my clinical terminology fairly in order at this point, but perhaps I am missing a key descriptor that would suddenly reveal exactly what I’m looking for?

Truly anything that might lead me to what I’m looking for would be much appreciated.

If You Are Having A Hard Time….,"






I remember when I was first diagnosed with herpes, it felt like my world was over. It was over as I knew it. 
I survived cancer, childhood trauma & abuse, depression-anxiety and herpes all within 24-years-old. So yeah, you could say I felt like it was the last straw. That my life was always meant to be doomed. But what I failed to realize or even understand at the time of my herpes diagnosis is even though my world was forever changed as I knew it, it wasn’t the first time it was changed and it won’t be the last time. And despite that fact, I’ve survived all of it. So now I can come to you and say I know I will survive this diagnosis too. 

And so will you.

She tells me not to worry and that  she's very careful with it and from looks of it her vagina looked fine no signs of an outbreak obviously I cant really look inside. Mind you my sister has it so im not freaking out over it because its pretty much just a rash but theres this stupid stigma behind it but a week or so later my penis foreskin starts to tear and begins to itch with tearing/shedding it wasnt too bad no burning pee, no soreness, no sickness im still going to gym fine I honestly feel fine and from reading everyone's symptoms it makes me think I dont have it but its been going on for little over a week now and just healing as of today only other symptom i got was itching no lesions of any kind . I talked to my doctor she said she doesn't think I have it because id feel it for sure but the time coincidence just doesnt seem right to me to give you all an idea of how it looks I found an image online that suits what I had.

To conclude my story yesterday I went in for STD test she said she couldnt test me specifically for herpes because she couldnt take a couture of any active lesions because there arnt any.

Sure asymptomatic people don’t have to deal with outbreaks but they still have the stigma and they are more likely To pass it to a partner because they don’t know what to look out for. Hsv-1 may tend to have  less outbreaks then hsv-2 but they are more likely to pass it to other body parts. Like stop it’s all herpes. Every part of it and every time a post like this circulates it creates stigma with in the group of herpes people. You don’t know the personal struggles of each person in here.

Newbie,"I don’t know if I have HSV-1 Oral. I was seeing someone and we slept together 3 times over the course of a few months.

So they told me (in a way that absolutely sucked). I decided to see them and we did some sexy time stuff and ended up sharing a few pecks. That was 6 days ago. I feel like my lips have been tingling/burning, now really fu*kin dry, and now wondering if I see a few little red dots or some different color on parts of my lip. They told me at the STI clinic on Monday that the best test is the site, not blood work. How do I cope when I’m not sure? I don’t want to add to the stigma meaning it’s the worst thing ever if I have it. It’s more so the shame of how this happened and that I caused this. How do people handle future partners? The STI nurse said it’s not something you need to share with future partners? That seems non consenting. Maybe she meant if I don’t show symptoms cause she said so many have it.

Disclosing to someone you’d have to see everyday,"So I contracted this virus (GHSV-1) 8-9 months ago and have only had one (semi-positive) disclosure. Although this has been my only disclosure and I have yet to try again. I think that I’m far more comfortable trying to date men outside of my “everyday life” (avoid: school, work, friend group) because it poses less of a risk of drama and heartache. 

Now my predicament here is that I’ve developed this crush on a guy that I have classes with and I have a good idea that he is also attracted to me. But my fear is: one ruining the friendship if he denies me due to my condition and two having to see him in class after disclosing (if things don’t go well).

I never want to restrict myself with this virus because you never know who may also have it. What if I pass up this opportunity while he may be completely compatible?

Additional: I also have a history of avoiding strong feelings as this protects me from getting hurt. But I’m really trying to be vulnerable, I haven’t felt this way about someone in a long time.

Do you guys have any advice about sharing such information with someone you have to spend time with often? Should I wait to make any advances till I don’t have to see him a lot?

Is this herpes near my butthole or something else,"https://imgur.com/a/A6GgPzC

So this is about the 3rd or 4th time I have experienced this over the last few years however this is the worst I have experienced it. 

The last time I had this was January 2021, I took a photo of it back then and it was similar In appearance however only a much smaller less angry looking sore. 

Symptoms each time is just a feeling of irritation and itch, it’s not painful, at the most it’s a mild discomfort. I can easily sit down for long periods of time, walk around etc. When I poop it’s almost relieving as it kind of scratches the itch. When I wipe it’s more of a mild discomfort but also relieving as it’s also scratching the itch, but might be more painful if I wiped harder. I do not feel unwell, I have no flu like symptoms or fever. 

I do not recall any primary outbreak, but I do recall similar symptoms from time to time over the years, usually just assuming it’s a heat rash or jock itch as I have had reoccurrences of jock itch in groin area which goes away with anti fungals. Have never been unwell with any outbreak. I am not really run down or stressed. Usually when I get it, it might last a week or so. However this time it has been about 2 weeks, not getting better, not getting worse but this is definitely the worst I have had it. 

If a herpes outbreak was this big, I’d assume it would be extremely painful, which this isn’t? This is also the worst I’ve had it but it’s about the 3rd or 4th occurrence, usually with herpes the first OB is the worst? I also don’t have any swollen glands as far as I can find.

Let’s also assume I’ve been exposed to herpes at some point in my life over the years.

But anyway. Keen to see what others thoughts are. Yes I know, also to go see a doctor for diagnosis.",tc4756,0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tc4756/is_this_herpes_near_my_butthole_or_something_else/,2022-03-11 19:26:16-05:00

New here - advice?,"Hello - I've never had an HSV outbreak so if this is indeed what it is, it is my first, but after looking at photos I am not sure if this is HSV-1 or canker sores? My lower right lip was painful and swollen when I woke up on 3/1/21 and I'm now on day 11 of having what looks like possibly blisters? They are only on the more interior portion of my lower right lip, not on the edge of the lip like I see in most HSV-1 photos and not anywhere else on my lips, mouth, or face. They are incredibly painful to touch, have made it painful to eat, and sometimes hurt on their own without being touched. They don't tingle and I don't recall a tingling the day prior to symptoms. I've read they can burn, which the pain feels burn-y when I touch them but not on their own. The odd thing is that they seem to ebb and flow throughout the day with regards to the blisters being ""full"" (I don't know what other term to use), and they haven't broken or pussed or scabbed over. 

The 4 pictures are from varying times of the day over the last 3 days. From what I've read this 11 days seems longer than the blister stage usually lasts for HSV outbreaks? I've been with the same partner for 11 years but I'm aware that HSV can lurk around asymptomatically for a long time. Thanks for any advice.

Need Clarification,"So a bit of backstory, I was with a girl and she cheated on me, only girl i've ever laid down with. Went to get a full panel test just to be safe. Everything checked out except the doctor said I tested a 1.69 for HSV-2. But to my knowledge i've never experienced any symptoms down there. What were your guy's symptoms if you have HSV-2? I have had a cold sore and read that it can cause a false positive but I thought I'd consult some of you guys. They recommended testing again in 6 months for reassurance but I'm gonna try to get in sooner, maybe order the western plot test. It just doesn't make any sense and it's driving me mad. Any kind of help or advice would help immensely right now. Thank you guys.",tc1dtp,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tc1dtp/need_clarification/,2022-03-11 17:05:09-05:00
"disclosures, etc.","It's been almost 2 years since I contracted GHSV2, and I just have to say how much easier disclosing gets. At first, I would build it up in my head so much and sometimes even ghost people because of it. Then I started doing it over text so I could say everything I wanted to (in a matter-of-fact fashion). Now, I will do it whenever the time is right, and I think since I'm super casual but informative about it, it's received well by my partners. I have been respectfully rejected by 2 people (I always say something like ""if you're not comfortable I won't take it personally"" just to alleviate any pressure). BUT I have had 9 sexual partners since, all of which I disclosed to, all of which didn't give a FUCK lol. Two of those were like ""oh me too!"" I've had one person who just asked to take it slow, asked lots of good questions, and seemed genuinely curious about the real info. I guess I just wanted to post this to reassure people that this diagnoses does not have to ruin your sex life. Transparency is hot, and if someone isn't comfortable, that's OKAY. There are people who will understand and accept this.",tbqvce,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tbqvce/disclosures_etc/,2022-03-11 09:05:46-05:00
Is this herpes? Sorry I know it’s annoying,"I know y‘all are probably annoyed by all these „is this herpes?“ questions but I just have to lol.. maybe y‘all are like this CLEARLY not herpes so then I can be relieved 

I f/23 got these red spots out of nowhere on my pubic area next to my leg, like my groin, but both sides. It’s a couple red small dots and one big one. I didn’t shave for a long time so it’s not an ingrown hair. It itches/stings VERY mild. I read that herpes hurts EXTREMELY bad, but it’s not like that. Also there is no blister, just these weird red spots, and one of them being bigger than the others and very red.

Previously to that I was tested two times for IGG HSV2 both times index under 0.5, so negative.

So it could be genital HSV1, but both my parents have oral blisters so chances are high I already got that as a kid and up to 90% of population has it anyways, so probably me too. But maybe I didn’t get it and now I got it as genital HSV1

Is it possible that herpes looks like that and never develops blisters? What do y‘all think?

Test results and how to proceed (need advice!),"My gf tested positive in a routine screening (even with no symptoms, no known previous exposure, etc.) with an IGG of 1.3. I later tested positive with an IGG of 1.2, also with no known symptoms/exposure. She had previously tested negative several months back at a different lab. All doctors we’ve spoken to have said that we are fine, but I am still feeling really anxious about it. I am paranoid about every little pimple and scan my body so much every day. Obviously the WB is the best test but we both don’t have the money for it. Should she get a confirmation IGG test at the previous lab and if it’s negative assume we’re both good?",tbzpgv,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tbzpgv/test_results_and_how_to_proceed_need_advice/,2022-03-11 15:46:50-05:00

Check iron levels,"If you are getting recent outbreaks, I suggest having a supplement deficiency blood test done.

Question about getting herpes during oral sex,"I’m F24, and when I was younger I did gave HSV on my lips a few times. Last one was probably years ago, maybe at 16 yo or younger. I assume that’s HSV-1.

1. I’ve heard if a person has type HSV-1 already, it’s harder to get HSV-2 on genitals, is this true? Do I have a smaller risk now of getting HSV on my genitals if I receive oral sex?

2. Can HSV be mostly outside of mouth, not inside?

3. If I give oral to a guy who’s got a HSV-2 infection on his penis, and I get HSV in my mouth/lips, will it act differently than HSV-1, or will I have the same symptoms of a few HSV blisters on lips?

4. What are the realistic risks of catching HSV on my genitals from cunnilingus?",tbp2zu,3,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tbp2zu/question_about_getting_herpes_during_oral_sex/,2022-03-11 07:29:21-05:00
I’m okay - just nervous about some life changes/goals. Tips and advice welcomed.,"Hey, so I’ve been diagnosed with GHSV-1 and another sweet surprise of HPV 16 and 18. I am currently a law student who works around the clock and am nervous about a future outbreak and how it affects my ability to keep up with my work. Please note I also have learning disability and it takes two times as long to complete work, but I must keep my grades up as I’m on scholarship so I’m seeking advice on how to maintain the busy lifestyle I had before.

The kicker is that I’m one of those few people who went through all of the worst symptoms. I couldn’t lie down, stand, or walk without pain and was using numbing cream and water to dilute my pee even though I’ve gauged my own ears and sit for tattoos without any issues. Fevers galore every morning. Had a severe case of hemorrhoids going on at the same time as a result of the HSV outbreak. Was sickeningly exhausted since my immune system was in overdrive. Blah blah blah.

My doctor prescribed me suppressants but I’m a bad hydrater (and trying to be better) and smoke weed on the weekends. I’m vegetarian (pre-diagnosis) and am going as gluten free as I can since my diagnosis. Because of my learning disability I also take vyvanse and although they aren’t supposed to interact, i feel more light headed generally on the days I do take the vyvanse despite drinking tons of water.

I take supplements on the daily including vitamin D, ginkgo for memory lmao (not important), and my allergy medicine. Occasionally I’ll take a sleeping pill for my sleep disorder as well.

Sure the mild headaches and dehydration are frustrating but I’m ultimately worried about a new outbreak during school or summer work and summer school (since I’ll be working full time and trying to take a class while also having another part time, paying job). I was going to take summer classes and be off the suppressants because I want to build antibodies and keep my liver safe, but I’m not sure how important that is? Also how about the smoking?!",tbv805,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tbv805/im_okay_just_nervous_about_some_life_changesgoals/,2022-03-11 12:30:29-05:00
Hsv in cervix?,"F/27 - I’ve had HSV2 for about a year now. 

I’ve been on this forum on and off for mental health breaks because sometimes it leads me down a depression hole if I overdo it. However I’ve not been taking care of myself and going through some induced hormonal changes and suffering a pretty shitty OB that seems to be making its way around. I usually get it in the same spot but I’m getting one after the other sort of traveling around my vulva (somewhat like my primary OB but one at a time one after the other as opposed to a fuck ton all over) 

I just got the tingle inside my actual cervix area, which I’ve never ever had before and it got me thinking, i don’t think I’ve ever seen anyone post or respond about having it there? I know it’s possible but I’ve gotten the most honest/resourceful info here and don’t think I’ve seen it written about before. Anyone experience that and what am I in for? Just got off BC and if I have trouble with feminine products I’ll be fucking PISSED 😂

Also side note, anyone have horrible side effects from valtrex/ didn’t barely work if at all and found something else that worked? Acyclovir might be my next attempt, but I imagine it’s similar. I’m getting back on a supplement that’s worked in the past (lysine,  b12 , c, oregano & red algae) and gonna try some vitamin d as that seems to have worked for some but this Shit is probably the worst I’ve had to deal with since my primary.",tbku0c,6,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tbku0c/hsv_in_cervix/,2022-03-11 02:37:49-05:00

What Would You Do?,"First off-  thank you to this community.  First post but this place has been a incredibly helpful resource.

Background-  November 2021 I came back positive (1.74,  IgG test) for HSVII on a routine 10 panel test.   I had not had an outbreak and the result floored me.  After reading this board, I decided to go through with a Western Blot and to my relief, received a negative result.  

Early March 2022, I had what appeared to be some kind of flair up with multiple, clustered pimple like bumps on my private parts.  I don't think these were razor burn and they have mostly faded away at this point.  These showed up about two weeks following the last time I regrettably had unprotected sex (mid February 2022) with someone I don't know very well.  I freaked out and assumed I'd definitely caught something.  

Two days ago I went and did another routine 10 panel test, expecting the worst.  While I still came back positive for HSVII, my result (1.22) had actually decreased from the previous time I had tested which a Western Blot had ruled a false positive.

If you were me, what would you do?  I'd rather not go through the costly process of another Western Blot.  Is it irresponsible / faulty to assume that just because I was negative last time and my IgG score was actually lower this time that I don't have it?",tbs2a5,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/tbs2a5/what_would_you_do/,2022-03-11 10:05:00-05:00
