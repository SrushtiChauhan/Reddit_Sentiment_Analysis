tnagdm,"How likely am I to have HIV? 19M here

My ex boyfriend is HIV positive and undetectable, his latest test was done 3-4 weeks ago and his viral load was in the acceptable range. I was not on PrEP but sexual intercourse was always protected. We did rub on each other naked with no protection but no penetration was involved. Unprotected oral sex was also involved but he never finished in my mouth.

I’m currently sick and I know it could be anything else but I’m so worried. (Tested neg for covid)

I’m getting tested tomorrow, but I’m currently VERY anxious and would like to know how likely would it be for me to contract it.",0,2022-03-24 21:07:02-04:00,,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIV/comments/tnagdm/how_likely_am_i_to_have_hiv/
tn9f7y,Possible hiv ? So I had sex with a woman a week and two days ago without a condom and she told me she doesn’t have anything but she has slept with decent amount of guys. However a day or two after I had symptoms such as sore throat and minor minor fever. Sore throat continued for a few days went away and reappeared today slightly. Tested neg for covid and strep and doc said it virus and it will go away on its own. Does this sound like hiv or is it just a flu ? Also should I watch for symptoms after two weeks?

tlvqdk,"im scared :( i gave oral to a random guy on grindr, said he was clean and for the past 3 months ive been having symptoms such as:

	•	swollen tonsil left side
	•	coated tongue (bleeds when brushed sometimes)
	•	alot of mucus and phlegm
	•	fatigue
	•	UTI & foamy pee, discomfort when peeing
	•	i had a high EBV of 600+
	•	had ulcers the first week or two
	•	fogginess
	•	runny nose
	•	occasional cough
	•	stomach issues, mucus poops & discomfort

i tested for all possibilities (besides oral swab) at 55-60 days: 

HIV ab/ag p24 w reflux neg

oraquick home test at 30 days neg

urine culture showed crystals & more leading to the diagnosis of a UTI, neg for everything :(

but my biggest fear is i have something like syphilis, or still could have HIV; or chlamydia/gonorrhea;

i have taken doxy, cefpo & fluconazole to see if it would help and they didnt :(

could i still be infected with something else?",9,2022-03-23 22:42:15-04:00,"Wait, so you got tested for Chlamedia and Gonorrhea?

tjffkw,"wondering if I got hiv. First off I know this might piss off a lot of people but I'm just paranoid and i need reassurance. Ok so I hooked up with a girl about a month ago she said she has hooked up with a decent amount of guys in the past. Anyways used a condom and everything. After about 4 weeks or so I got a nasty cough. And I get a very slight burn for like a couple seconds at the tip and near the underside when I touch it, I get a sort of a sharp pain every once in awhile. Is that something to stress about? Like I said I don't mean to piss yall off with this cause I see a lot of people complaining about these types of posts but I just gotta know what my risks are",8,2022-03-21 12:14:13-04:00,"Those aren’t symptoms of HIV, if you used the condom correctly then no you probably didn’t get an STD or HIV. Go get tested anyway though cause I can tell it’s gonna keep bugging you unless you know it isn’t that get tested rn and then again at 3 months. ### Maybe herpes passed through oral sex, get tested for STI.

The cough, maybe COVID, get tested too. ### that's not hiv, dont worry ### Testing at 3 months is the old window period. If you use a 4th gen test then it becomes conclusive at day 45. ### It’s not conclusive till 6 months technically, but it’s 99% accurate at around 3 months ### Nope, you’re referring to a 3rd gen hiv test. A 4th gen test would show more then 99.9% of infections at day 45. Don’t mislead people with false information. ### That isn’t false information. Nobody says 45 days is conclusive, people say to retest at 3 and 6 months. ### Please, you have no idea what you’re talking about, and this can cause others to panic. The cdc and other government funded organizations claim that an hiv 4th gen test (antibody/antigen) is conclusive at day 45 and shows 100% of infections at day 50.

If so can you looking me in that direction.. I know you guys hate when people that are negative come in here and comment, so I'll save my story and what's going on with me.. but any info would help greatly ☺️",16,2022-03-20 22:46:06-04:00,"I work in the field of HIV treatment and I have never heard of anyone having a test come back reactive after that long. Especially with a 4th Gen which checks for antibodys and antigens. If you are already past the 3 month mark everything will stay as the test states.  I hope this helps. ### Officially it is conclusive at 28 days post exposure. However, from current scientific data, we know that when the test is done at 20 days post exposure, it is already as good as 100% accurate ### being curious got you aids or crabs, whatever you have. I rather waste my time typing this than reading your love story about how you got aids. ### Well the thing is I took a 4th gen at 7 1/2 days, 2 months, 95 days, oraquik×2 at 2 1/2 months and almost 4 months, and another point care test at 8 months (insti test) all negative

But I have been have really strange symptoms like random blood blister on inside of lower lip (when I've never got them before) it's happen like 4 different times now, my digestive system is complete fucked up (difficultly pooping/ constipation), pimple like rash on my lower back (still have it and that going on for about 2 mouths now), sinus and facial pressure (that comes and goes), and really no appetite I just eat because I know I have too but did also lots weight went from 217 to 198 in the first 3 months of this happening but have since gained my weight back. ### Really? I was wondering about this… 
I did RNA test at day 28 and then 4th gen combo lab test at day 30… all tests negative 
Was wondering if I should retest at day 45 or 90? ### WTF is your problem? Did I hurt you some how? Didnt like what I posted move the fuck along I'm not bothering you... You stupid fuck... ### Then you should stop looking towards hiv when you've done so many test of which 1 was pointless (if you havnt had sex in that time) and talk to ur doctor because this could either be another std or something completely different from stds at all.  Which I'd point towards not a std this is something completely different.  So stop focusing on that.  It isn't the only disease out there dude. ### Not tryna be mean but alot of people go for tests and not trust the system.  Then why go?  And they think hiv is the only thing out there where as other disease progressed and are more deadly now than hiv because we've learned how to suppress it to almost curable levels. ### Retest at 45 days using a 4th gen hiv test and it should be conclusive. Although even 30 days is pretty accurate. ### Geez calm down. Don't get riled up after all you're the one that has HIV. 💀 ### But you assume HIV is the only thing I went for and it's not, I've been tested for other things as well, done colonoscopy and endoscope, and I can't ever get my be doctor to even refer me to a infectious disease doctor when clearly I'm showing signs of something and I'm not saying that I don't trust the system at all I'm very good about getting tested consistently at least every 3 months... And I've been relatively healthy all my life except this past 8 months some weird shit has been going on and things that I cannot wrap my head around... But I was also very hesitant to even Post in here because I know a lot of people with HIV are very cold and non caring I can just tell but the reply throughout comments that are posted ### You get a kick outta just trying to press people off huh? That's a sad lonely life you live dude, I'm sure you do this to everyone looking for information which is fucked up frfr ### Hey, 

Take vitamins drink lots of water and stop worrying so much about HIV. Soon as you get in to your head you are HIV negative all the symptoms will go away. Your mind is a powerful thing. ### Well stop going for hiv tests and get a new doctor simple as that.  Ur doctor clearly isn't good.  Wish you all the best honestly.  This sounds severe and you need medical attention now.  Forget them and call a clinic or walk in ### Sure do get a kick, makes my life seem better than yours, cuz I don't got them aids ### I guess dude have fun with your sad ass thing you call a life and remember karma's a bitch... ### ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIV/comments/tj1nad/just_curious/

around a week after the encounter i got a white tongue that i could scrub off with mouth wash and a toothbrush but 3 months its still been lingering; in a panic as anyone would at around a month i took an at home test and it was negative; then at around 55-60 days i took a blood draw test to run for other std’s, and luckily was negative, so i wanna know what conclusion i can take?

never had a fever, occasional cough and one of my tonsils seems to be a tad swollen its my left side, my tongue gets sore occasionally but alot of people are telling me anxiety; GIVEN i do tend to hyperfocus on little things and apply it to me being sick, i did test positive for EBV and my count was 600+ so ive been extremely fatigued and exhausted, i also have a UTI that was seen in my urine; i was prescribed doxy, fluconazole and cefpo to rule out other things; what would you take from this? are my results conclusive?

Don't be scared HIV is not a death sentence anymore.

You need to test at the right time for conclusive results.

Feel free to message me for more information. x ### I’m really sorry that happened to you, just want you to know that the achy feelings and the sore throat can be from the stress brought on by the traumatic event. Your immune system is lowered because of trauma. I would get tested in about 2 more weeks, and if it’s negative then you 99% don’t have it. Either way, I hope you find some sort of peace one day and that scumbug will eventually get what they deserve. ### Dude I am in the same boat. I was asked if o wanted to party more in Vegas. I said I was sleepy “I can fix that”. I too am straight. Everything is hazy. When memory came back on line o was working and questioning everything.
I thought about pep but the. Thought maybe I dreamt it, my butt felt fine but I kept on having flashes of trying to fight them off.. 
then a month later five days of fever. Then a rash and then thrush. The thought I could have exposed my fiancé is killing me. I’m afraid she won’t believe me and will think o cheated or binged, because I was loopy AF the next few days. When I said I think someone tried to drug me she didn’t really want to believe me…

I can’t get a straight answer from anyone honestly. I’m in same boat. ### How are you so sure are you a doctor? ### CDC: . An antigen/antibody test performed by a laboratory on blood from a vein can usually detect HIV infection 18 to 45 days after an exposure. There is also a rapid antigen/antibody test available that is done with a finger prick. Antigen/antibody tests done with blood from a finger prick can take longer to detect HIV (18 to 90 days after an exposure). ### i'm not a doctor yet, my god parents are both doctors, i learned from them a lot about hiv, ask a doctor about the 4th gen test, s/he'll prob say 6 weeks ### Yeah mine wasn’t rapid and I’ve seen this statistic but I just don’t know if my results can be accurate because of the thrush I am dealing with and yes my doctor diagnosed me with thrush.

tg1isb,"TO EVERYBODY WHO IS A HYPOCHONDRIAC Let me start by saying, I understand the anxiety of being diagnosed with a potential STD. It's fucking terrifying, it can alter your life. It can be a financial strain because of the cost of medications, and also it's extremely stigmatized, however here are some key facts. So people can stop fucking asking dumb questions.

How is HIV contracted? It's contracted through sex (vaginal or anal sex) you can't get HIV through giving a handjob, and you can't get it through someone giving you oral. It's not spread through saliva, so quit trolling and get over with your irrational fears. It is also spread through blood, unless someone stabs you with a needle that they filled with their blood or blood got into your eyes. mouth, or another mucus membrane. THEN YOU CAN'T CONTRACT IT. Also breast feeding, in case you're a 6 month old child browsing this subreddit. 

Second, let's talk about the window period of HIV tests. 

For starters, HIV can be detectable, thanks to the advancement of technology up to early as 3 weeks. Go get tested with a 4th generation Ag/Ab test, otherwise known as an Antigen/Antibody Test. These tests can detect both HIV-1 and HIV-2 (a rarer form of HIV found pre-dominantly in African countries). The window period for this test is usually around 45 days according to the CDC guidelines, this test has a high specificity and sensitivity meaning it is both good at ruling out and detecting infections. The reason this test has a shorter window period is because of it's ability to detect antigens which are present in the blood before the body begins to develop antibodies to HIV infection. If you get tested after 6 weeks, chances are very slim you are infected. However, to account for some people who have slower production of antibodies, because of antigen may not be detectable. It is recommended to re-test after 90 days or 3 months and then again at 6 months to account for VERY RARE cases, where people did not develop antibodies within a normal time frame.

I'll say it again. Test at 45 days or 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. If you get tested and these are negative, then YOU DON'T HAVE HIV. It does not matter, if you have ""oral thrush"", which BTW YOU NEED A DOCTOR to diagnose you, a lot of people have some white on their tongue, you morons. it does not matter, if you have muscle aches, or if you have loss of appetite, or canker sores. Those things can literally be caused by you guys being huge hypochondriacs. Now quit asking if your HIV TEST is conclusive. Grow a pair of balls and get tested, that's literally all you can do. Quit playing the WHAT IF  I HAVE IT GAME. 

It's annoying to see how irrational people are,.",43,2022-03-17 00:06:18-04:00,"but is it necessary to get tested at 6 months? ### Thank you for informing everyone here, but the hiv combo test (antigen/antibody) is considered conclusive at 6 weeks or 45 days and no further testing is required. (Unless your in chemotherapy or attempted other risky exposure within the 45 days). I hope this helps ### My doctor did diagnose me with oral thrush and I’ve had multiple non reactive HIV test had a non reactive test at 65 days using 4th gen combo test but I’m still nervous too because she doesn’t know what’s causing my thrush and I’ve been taking anti fungals and it isn’t going away. ### Hi, 

I am from the UK i volunteer for a HIV and AIDS group.   

Your comment is very true i see this a lot on here. Can i get HIV from a hand job!! NO!!

Also it is very hard to contract HIV from a woman. 

Most people living with HIV are gay or bisexual men. people who share needles. or  ethnic background. 

Guys we really need to stop the stigma of HIV it is no longer a death sentence. 

people educate your self. :) ### No. The CDC recommendation is 3 months. They are incredibly conservative. If it was taking 6 months they would not recommend conclusive until 6 mths. Logically. 

Anyone recommending 6 mths is causing unnecessary anxiety for people susceptible to that. ### but is't behoveful to receiveth did test at 6 months?

^(I am a bot and I swapp'd some of thy words with Shakespeare words.)

Commands: `!ShakespeareInsult`, `!fordo`, `!optout` ### Get a grip man, you don’t have HIV from a handjob. Jesus Christ ### Yes but for homosexual every 3 months ### what about 3rd gen? ### That seriously is misleading. You need to get follow up testing up to 6 months. If you’re so confident it’s negative after 45 days, then why not get tested again after 3 months and 6 months? ### Yes I 100% agree, most people are ill-informed about the manner in which HIV is transmitted. it’s also heavily stigmatized because of this, most people are unaware that an undetectable viral load will equate to a zero chance of contracting the virus. In addition, I’d like to also point out that testing is highly accurate at 45 days. It’s very likely you don’t have the virus if you test after 45 days. It’s just a good precaution to test at 3 months and 6 months. 

Someday, the HIV virus will be wiped out thanks to medications such as PReP and antiretroviral therapy. ### okay then. thank you. i guess ill just have to try my best bury this and move on.. ### its just these red bumps(mostly pale bumps) on my forearm are pretty concerning. have tested on my 3rd month negative. and still anxious everyday.. ### okay. im kind of confused.. cos my encounter was on oct29th last year and i got tested on 2nd week after encounter then on my 3rd month on feb 2.. should i ger tested on april or may for the 6th month? ### I’m not an expert but I’m going through this like you, 3rd gen if I recall that it’s conclusive after 90 days, but getting tested at 2 months will give you a clear indication if you’re infected or not. ### No you don’t. 6 mths was early 90’s due to the sensitivity of tests back then. Tests these days are some of the most accurate in medicine. 6 weeks and then 3 mths to be absolutely sure. The chances of a 3 mth negative changing to positive are similar to getting struck by lightning. ### Yeah sorry you have HIV man. ### As long as it's 3 months you're fine.  That's more than enough time for your body to build antibodies for any disease that enters it to fight off the antigens.  So if you had it, it would show already so I'd say ur absolutely fine. ### like getting tested again in 2 months after a conclusive test on your 3rd month mark? ### But the chance is still there nonetheless, you should get tested either way at 6 months to be sure you ruled out an infection. Claiming ItS ConClusive at 6 weeks, is a load of horseshit. Everyone’s immune system is different but a negative at 6 weeks and 3 months is a pretty good indication you don’t have it, however it’s not 100% ### i have seen your post and you were worried and having doubts about your tests. and yet this is how you treat people having anxiety with the infection? ### yeah but i had ""symptoms"" too.. ### You just don’t understand how ag/ab tests work then. By 6 weeks, antigen will be present (most of the time they peak at 3-4 weeks)If it’s not, it’s because they are binding to the antibodies your body is now producing. Therefore, if someone has hiv, the ag or ab component of the test will be positive by 6 weeks. Usually by 4. 
It is not physiologically possible to not have antigen or antibodies by 6 weeks. ### Except I had an actual exposure. If you had an actual exposure, I would be more compassionate but you’re blatantly refusing to acknowledge that HIV CANNOT BE CONTRACTED through a handjob and are mocking others who actually may have potentially been exposed. 

It’s so infuriating, how you can’t even see how stupid your posts are. Why don’t you worry about STD’s that can be spread through handjobs like Herpes or HPV? You pick the one STD that can’t even spread through handjobs 😂. How dense are you ### Did the test come back negative? ### Your condescending tone is laughable. Yes antigens are detectable in the blood from around week 4 to week 8 on average, but there can be cases where antigen does not reach detectable levels before they disappear or antibody production does not reach detectable levels before a longer time frame. Everyone’s immune system is different and this is why no doctor or government will usually say 45 days is “conclusive”. Keep telling yourself otherwise, even though I doubt you will find a reputable doctor who says otherwise. You’re just a clown buddy ### what was your exposure if i may ask? ### yes on my 3rd month mark they told me its conclusive ### I guess Dr Handsfield and Dr Hook from Ask the Experts aren’t reputable. 

You are the clown. lol at 6 mths. You time travel from the early 90’s? ### yeah, you got hiv, now stop doing stupid useless posts ### Ya so ur fine then man.  Why r u so caught on one thing when ur symptoms can be completely some other than a std?  Alot of people scare themselves with std when it's something completely different and instead of looking for that, too much time passes and it becomes chronic ### Since you’re clearly a retard and can’t read, I’ll link two sources who don’t say that 3 months is conclusive. 

First is WebMD which is reviewed by doctors before it’s published. 

https://www.webmd.com/hiv-aids/hiv-window-period

Quote: “Antibody tests, which look for the antibodies -- special proteins that help fight infection -- that your body makes in reaction to an HIV infection. Most rapid tests and at-home tests are these kind. Antibody tests require the longest wait time after infection to get an accurate result. For most people -- around 97% -- this takes anywhere from 2 to 12 weeks. For some, it can take as long as 6 months.”

Or Planned Parenthood, Quote: “It usually takes about 3 months for your body to make enough antibodies to show up on an HIV test, but it could be even longer. This time after you first get infected but won’t test positive for HIV is called the “window period.””

See how these two sources don’t say anything about 3 months being ConClusive, Captain Porch Monkey? It can sometimes take longer than 3 months. 3 months is a very very good sign you’re not infected, but not everybody’s immune system is the same. Also the CDC doesn’t ever use the word “conclusive” it says “can usually detect” in case you haven’t noticed what that means, it means that it’s not definitive until you repeat the test after a certain period. Most doctors will say 6 months to be considered conclusive, but 6 weeks and 3 months is the usual standard people will seroconvert. Big difference but I’m glad to be able to  break it down for your pea-sized brain. ### cause these red/pale bumps on my arms are pretty concerning.. theyre not alot but just a few bumps here and there... ### https://www.reddit.com/r/Dermatology/comments/tg4bra/any_idea_what_these_redpale_bumps_could_be_im/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf ### Now do the CDC. Nobody takes 6 months. ### Literally what you're posting is nothing at all..  and you can't not get HIV from mutual masterbation unless for some reason you had a cut that was open and cum got into but that is very highly unlikely and from what you posted you didn't exchange bodily fluids..... Shoot is anything you might have HSV and that can be passed skin to skin so I would suggest you go get check for that.. ### “For all other tests, CDC recommends testing again at least 90 days after exposure to be sure that a negative test result is accurate.”

If it took 6 months the CDC would specify to test at least 180 days after exposure to be sure that a negative result is accurate. 

They can’t say conclusive because they would get sued the one time out of 20 million or whatever the low chances are that someone took longer than 3 mths. ### Also you have some bizarre anger issues. ### Just checked your posting history. Quite interesting comment in light of your 6 mths insistence all of a sudden. You should see a Dr for anxiety instead of dolling out horrendous advice.

And you make this thread? Are you a troll? ### You’re being really hypocritical. You asked people on an HIV subreddit, if testing 4 years later is enough but say that 45 days is conclusive? What’s it gonna be buddy 4 years or 45 days? ### Anxiety. I have it. You have it. But in the end I trust the science. But you are being irresponsible by causing others irrational anxiety by indicating it takes 6 mths. Again, if it did, the CDC would recommended testing out to 6 mths. ### Dude, I’m not causing anybody anxiety. I agree most people test positive at 6 weeks and 3 months.

Last August (2021) I kissed a girl and received Oral Sex and came in her mouth. The thing is that this girl is known for being easy with men and basically giving it to almost anyone. A few days ago I got news from my cousin, she told me that the girl did a pregnancy test which is not related to me, and that during the test they also tested her blood and came back HIV positive. This might not be true because it was my uncle that told my cousin about it and he has a reputation of basically talking out of his ass and lying. Anyways, I want to know if there are chances of me getting the virus through kissing and me getting head. 

The anxiety is killing me on the inside as of this moment. ### Hey there I did another blood test for normal checking and it seems like I have low Lymphocytes level so do u think I need to do the HIV test again tommorow (it will be 6 weeks minus one day from exposure)? ### There is no (very little) chances of getting hiv through oral sex and kissing. Unless your P was bleeding and her mouth was full of her blood. Your blood to her blood contact. Saliva doesn't transmit HIV, only blood and body fluids do. If she is a easy girl she might have other sti's. Syphilis, gonn/chlam and etc. They could be asymptomatic. Better to get tested for syphilis and for HIV too to relax. ### ",0,https://i.redd.it/ruh8hdqjuen81.jpg
te0us4,"PEP after one exposure PEP after one exposure

Hello, I (24M) went to a sauna two weeks ago for curiosity. I broke up with my girlfriend a few months ago and experimenting with a man was something I wanted to try. Yes, I was extremely irresponsible, but I hooked up with only one guy there, he didn’t look shady but I mean, a bathhouse isn’t the best place for an ideal sexual health; when I went to his cabin he told me to do it bb. I knew it was a BIG red flag but in that moment I was not worried (big mistake). I topped him, and I came outside of him. Of course after leaving, I started panicking of what I did (also because I realized it wasn’t something I enjoyed as I thought). Immediately I used a teledoctor and I started PEP 5 hours after exposure. 

It’s been 16 days and so far I only had some itchiness at the first week and a mild sore throat two days ago (I guess it was anxiety). But I’m really scared and I need to wait a few weeks more to ease my mind… 

I would like to find some real stories of people who were on PEP, and if my risk is really that low, based on what the internet says (CDC shows a really low risk chance but another websites show a higher risk for uncut insertive). 

Also, I would like to know if an p24 antigen test would be accurate enough to calm my nerves if I decide to take one this week? I will do my other tests on the 29 of March(33 days) and the 14 of April (47 days), will these two tests be conclusive? Does PEP delay seroconversion?

HIV is not detectable at three days so there’s no way of knowing how high their viral load is.

So  did you preform or receive oral? Or both? 

An itchy body is highly unlikely to be HIV. If you develop a rash you should develop other symptoms soon after: fever, bed sweats, nausea, loss of appetite, sore throat, fatigue, possible diarrhea (these should feel more serious and last longer than the flu). 

At this point I don’t see a reason for you to get tested. However, if you develop more symptoms definitely go in. Or get tested now for peace of mind… there’s really no downside. You should definitely be detectable by now if you do have it. ### Receiving ### Yeah then that’s less than a 1 in 10,000 chance and that’s assuming your partner was positive.

tcz0t2,"HIV scare | waiting for results  27, Hispanic, 287lbs, gay male.

Hi,  I had been completely abstinent for the past 2 years or so due to  COVID. I experienced about a 35lbs loss recently after buying a Peloton  and that coupled with decreasing cases in my county led me to go out and  try to be sexually active again. Given that I don't really have sex  often in general, I'm not on prep. I ask them to use condoms. I met with  a 21 year old male off of a hookup app, but he did not have his status  listed. For this reason, I asked him to use a condom. We tried for about  4 minutes and he kept losing his erection. He said the condom bothered  him. It was foolish of me, but I told him to try without the condom and  we tried again for about 3 to 4 minutes. I noticed a bit of blood, so I  asked him to stop. He did not come close to ejaculating, but the whole  no condom thing really bothered me. It's been a little over 2 weeks. I  went to the clinic for STD screening. Around this time, I was also  receiving treatment for my hypertension. I was prescribed a new pill  prinzide. After two days on it, I experienced some pretty bad diarrhea.  It lasted about 3 days. It was really bad on the second day. I must have  gone to the restroom 12 times in a single day and felt like I was  getting dehydrated, so I drank Powerade. The sexual encounter happened  on 2/22 and I started the new pill on 2/27. The diarrhea occurred from  2/28-3/2. I thought maybe it was the new medication, but my doctor said  it was rather unlikely that the pill could have caused it. I was  previously just on 5mg of lisinopril and the prinzide was 22.5 mg I  believe. I did seem to test positive for 2 STDs, so I'm wondering if  that may have caused the diarrhea. I can't really make sense of the  results, but it seemed like my WBC was higher than the normal range. I  was also tested twice for liver function and my numbers were about  triple what it previously was, but then it went down, so again, I'm not  sure if the STDs had anything to do with that. I'm still waiting for my  HIV test to come back, but I am very anxious about it. It's only been a  little over 2 weeks, so I don't know if I would have experienced  symptoms by now. The diarrhea was the only major thing that I noticed.  But anyway, here are some of my test results if they make more sense and  if they might hint at me having contracted HIV.

It’s still pretty early and honestly there’s a chance your HIV test could come back as a false negative because it is so early. But I tested at a similar time (maybe a little later) and they came back (correctly) positive for me. I was showing severe symptoms by then though. 18-45 days is considered typical, so I hope they do an RNA test on you. Diarrhea is 100% explained by gonorrhea so I wouldn’t worry about HIV as long as you don’t have symptoms right now. ### I went to Kaiser and it seems like this is the kind of testing they might have done

[https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.human-immunodeficiency-virus-hiv-test.hw4961](https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.human-immunodeficiency-virus-hiv-test.hw4961)

The results are definitely taking longer than my other tests. What kind of symptoms did you experience? I've heard people mention fever as being the most common, but I haven't had one. I just had that terrible bout of diarrhea that lasted about 3 days. ### How long after exposure did you end up testing positive if you don’t mind me asking? ### Okay so they are doing both an antigen and RNA test which is great. With that information, I take back what I said before, I would be confident when you receive your results. It’s typical for HIV tests to take longer btw. The RNA test will probably take the longest.

From what I have read, early HIV symptoms can be mild at first and even mistaken as the flu. However, from personal experience and the experiences of those I know with HIV, this was the worst and longest illness of my life (granted I am pretty young). They are flu-like symptoms, just much more severe for me. It started with a rash and thrush in my throat. I had 103-106 degree fevers for a full week where I did not eat a single thing. I and the few people I know all went to the ER at some point. The fevers continued for 2.5 weeks in total and I felt heavy fatigue until the meds started kicking in. Obviously, the personal experience of three people is not indicative of everyone’s experience, but I have always been very fit and my doctor has commented on my phenomenal health. So if it did that to me, I’m surprised that it could be so mild for others. Regardless, I trust the scientific literature on this. 

Tell me your results when you get them if you’re comfortable. I hope you get good news. Free free to ask any other questions. 

Have you gotten treatment for the other STDs yet? ### Took blood probably 11-15 days after exposure, got positive results 4 days later. Didn’t even show up on the antibody/antigen tests at first. It took the RNA test to show a positive. That’s why you either should probably either wait 3 weeks or make sure you get an RNA test. ### I haven't had a fever as of now. I tend to get pretty sick going back to like 7th grade. I had a nasty case of bronchitis and whenever I get a cold/flu, it tends to last for a month at minimum it seems. I actually wonder if maybe I had contracted one of the two STDs I tested positive for earlier. Back in 2019, I remember my previous GP saying I had an unusually high white blood count, but I didn't really have any other symptoms, so he just figured it might be down to stress. I don't know much medical stuff, but a quick glance seems like higher WBC means a possible infection of some kind. It would be crazy if I had an STD for that long and didn't know about it. This would be the third guy I've done unprotected sex with. The first two were on prep and one even showed me his prep bottle, which I thought was interesting but sweet. All other times I've insisted on a condom. For that reason, I've never done a full STI screening until now. I'm very inexperienced for my age. It would suck if the 2-3 minutes he went in bare resulted in an infection, but I know it happens. 

I haven't been treated for the rectal chlamydia or oral gonorrhea yet. I just got those results yesterday morning. I was waiting for the results I'm anxiously awaiting before contacting my doc to see what kind of treatment I need. ### When did your symptoms started showing? I mean after how many weeks after exposure? ### Interesting. Can I DM you?
I had a fever for 4 days and it went away quickly. The thrush and rash happened after the fever, not before. I get tested tomorrow. I’m pretty sure I was roofied, and wasn’t even sure something happened but I get flashes of memory and now I’m pretty sure ### Well I’m glad you haven’t had any HIV symptoms. There could be a chance you contracted them much earlier. I definitely know chlamydia can lie dormant for years without you knowing. Gonorrhea less so, but still for a long time. Elevated WBC can for sure indicate some sort of infection. Not HIV though: it attacks CD4 cells which are a type of T cell, and T cells are the white blood cells that attack foreign particles. So at least we know you didn’t have that at the time. 

I know what you’re feeling. I always talked about sexual health and used condoms unless my partner was insistent on doing it raw. Most were on PrEP. Well it wasn’t enough. Probably 7 partners in total with precautions and it still happened. So don’t beat yourself up. The infections you have are curable, and in the slight chance you have HIV, it’s easily treatable with no side effects. Probably for the best that you’re waiting for all the results to contact your doctor. The treatments are just some antibiotics for a couple weeks. Or you can take a shot in the hip for gonorrhea. Super easy. Hope the best for your HIV test. ### I still don't see my results posted yet. Is it common for them not to be done yet? I went for testing on Friday afternoon. I did get a voicemail from the doc, but she just put a note in my other results. She said to go into the clinic for an antibiotic (I'm guessing the shot) and then start a 7-day course of antibiotics before having any intercourse again. If I did happen to test positive, would she be making that recommendation to have sex so soon? I would imagine she must have access to some of the results by now even if I don't. ### Yes the antibiotic would be for the gonorrhea I’m guessing. And if she’s telling you to take a medication for a week that would be for Chlamydia. I always thought you should wait one week after medication is done to have sex. I know I waited one week after the shot. 

I feel like you would have gotten the results by now. How many days has it been since they took your blood? I can’t imagine it would take more than a week. Do your results just have nothing on them right now? ### Let me check. It sounded like what you said (a shot) if I had to go to the nurse clinic to get it. She prescribed Ceftriaxone and then a 7 day course of Doxycycline. Finally she made the recommendation of not having any intercourse for the week of treatment. I'm just a little anxious still because she made no mention of the HIV result. Like I want to think she knows at least one of the test results and that it just hasn't updated on my end.

They took my blood just after noon on Friday, so it's been 3 days. The results just show up on my online portal when they are ready. The two different HIV tests she ordered are the only ones that haven't shown up yet. I just thought that maybe she might know the results if she's saying I could have sex again. I figured she would wait to see what the HIV result is before making such a recommendation. ### Yeah both of those treatments would be typical and effective. 

I doubt she knows the results and if she did, they would obviously be negative. I wouldn’t over-analyze what she said about having sex. You’ll know your HIV results by the end of the week anyway. I also wouldn’t worry about your HIV results taking too long. Three days isn’t that long and it’s usually the test takes a bit longer anyway. 

Tell me your results when you get them! I wouldn’t worry about anything right now. ### [deleted] ### Those are called tongue papillae and everybody has them. This is why you should try to avoid examining your body or thinking about it in general. If the symptoms come, trust me, you will know. Right now you have nothing to worry about. You’ve taken the necessary steps you need to take and the results will come💛 ### Turns out I was semi-right. She had the results for a little over a day, but had just not released them to me (guess the nurse couldn't see them either since she said they only showed up as pending). All of the other tests are usually automatically made available to me as they are charted. It said nonreactive for antigen and antibody. I'm not sure if those are the two exact tests you mentioned. I asked her about when I might be able to re-test and confirm the result so I can maybe go on PrEP as this whole scare really worried me. But first I have to treat the other STDs and I'll definitely abstain until I find out about the PrEP. The guy actually took off the condom without telling me - I only found out about it because we had made a little video. ### That’s great news. The test you took sounds like the 4th gen. The results are close to 100% correct so I’m not sure if a retest is necessary if you wanna get on PrEP but ask your doctor about that.

I’m sorry that happened to you. I had a similar situation and it’s considered to be SA as we didn’t consent to condom-less sex. It hasn’t affected me or caused me trauma or anything but still shitty to do. ### I'd definitely like to double check to be sure. It had only been about 15 days (I think) when they took my blood. I asked my doc when she suggest I try for a re-test. I also want to check with my main provider in case there might be any kind of interactions with my other BP med or if they need to check my liver again or something.

It was pretty messed up. It's not often you hear about a younger guy assaulting an older one (him being 21 and me 27), but after years of watching Law & Order: SVU, I should know that anybody can be an abuser. It did traumatize me a little because I didn't even know it had happened. The video is also why I was so confident about the duration of the encounter. He took the condom off at the 5:00 mark and the video was over at around 8 minutes when I asked him to stop because of the blood. It sucks that I may have picked up the two other STDs from him, but I'm happy that it looks like his assault didn't result in more. ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIV/comments/tcz0t2/hiv_scare_waiting_for_results/

And since your penis is not erected, the condom would absolutely not break as it's not stretched out (though still uncommon that it would break if it's stretched out) ### Are you hiv positive? ### Yes indeed I was having a hard time inserting it so i made her sit on me and stretched the condom so that it gets inserted but still ater some seconds Tye penis became more soft and it exited from hers and I looked at the condom it didn't slip and I don't remeber seeing the condom broke ### me? no ### Pretty sure it won't break especially when the condom isn't stretched out too much. If you used an oil-based lubricant then that'd increase the chance of breaking which I believe you didn't use. Are you new to sex may I ask? I believe everyone knows this and that the actual way to fully insert it is to make your penis fully erect first so it won't slip out. ### You had any risky exposure? Don't mind just curious to know ### The lube was already there on the condom. Yes kinda new to sex but also I knew that it should be erect. Is there any risk if it the dick slips out? ### yeah, i had, i banged with multiple ppl from grindr, rn, i'd just suck random men from grindr, this way i cant get hiv as i wouldnt perform oral sex if i have any injury or scar in my mouth,throat and lips ### No risks at all, don't worry! 😊 ### Don't mind me asking this to you one last time, i tried to insert my penis into that prostitutes vagina when my penis wasn't erect as I was stressed. I somehow made it semi erect and then pushed it into her, as my dick became more softer I had to back off and but saw the condom was there. And while trying for the second time again same it wasn't erect so i made to sit her on me and inserted that semi erect penis into her and she started sliding forward 3-4 times. And again bcoz my dick became soft it automatically exited from the vagina and while she was still sliding she was on my dick but when she got up I saw the condom was there but maybe half the dick covered but it was there. Now is it possible that it might have slipped inside as my dick was non erect or the virus would have entered the small cut which i had a day before due to trimming? I have no other symptoms other than the throat and red bumps on the back of my tongue and fever on and off ### no you cant get hiv this way, stop worrying in vain, there is no risk and no point to spend your money toget tested for that, you dont have hiv ### Did you ever get tested? ### Also then how does it spread? Due to unprotected sex? ### yep, once per 7 weeks if i'm sexually active with random men, i'm like a disease free analytical bitch with some wisdom ### yep, and enough fluids touching an open injury ### Tye injury which i had was a small cut due to the trimming which i had a day earlier but next day before having sex I couldnt even find any visible scars also...I don't know man, out of all the hiv+ cases I came accross this sub and also other reddit subs there people got hiv bcoz they had unprotected sex(almost all of them ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIV/comments/tcabqh/hiv_scare/

You are good. ### From what I hear it’s possible but very low chance. I’m in same boat I took 4th gen at 6 an 7 weeks and I’m still worried ### How did your worry start? I will tell you my experience. Randomly one night I remembered a risky thing i did with a former partner, what was it? I fingered her. Yes, you might say that's stupid and not worth a test. But I made the mistake of licking my finger afterwards and vaginal fluids are a way HIV can be transmitted. So I had a 4th gen test done at about 2-3 months after the exposure (do not remember the date quite well but I know it was kn that range) and it came non-reactive. If you're like me, you'll probably never find your conclusive result. I'm deeply anxious and always thinking of retesting. Plus, get into the internet and read conflicting info and you'll only get worse. My advice, from an health anxious fellow to another, if you want to retest, do it. But maybe what you should be checking is your health awareness overall. Today is HIV, tomorrow can be another deadlier disease. ### Most likely no change ### No not really, i think if you have symptoms u cant test negative on 4th gen, so you are probably ok, was it hetero or homosexual the risk? Without condom? ### If you wish tell us your experience. How it was, with m or f? Vaginal, anal or oral? Condom or without it? and people tell you your chances of getting it. Maybe your anxiety is exaggerated. What I have read here people are afraid of getting hiv after smone inserted their finger in anus ### I took a blood test one month after possible exposure and it came back negative . Is it likely I could still have HIV ? ### Gotta treat my anxiety then 🥺🥺 ### What i read from guideline, it says that 45 days is 99% conclusive. And almost noone has converted after 6 weeks, but still worried 🤣 ### Im just very anxious for everything lol, but i think im ok at 63 days test ### Bj without condom, sex was with protection, im just over exaggerating in my mind 😭 ### If it was from vein highly unlikely ### No never life time anxiety

Do you have any ? ### You're my friend, the mind is tricky sometimes ### You probably getting symptoms from long term anxiety, maybe try go to a therapist, might help you brother, stay strong :) ### Lymphnodes pain nd swollen(neck,armpit,groin), neasua, platelets low ,dry skin all over body ,spleen enlarge 13.1,pain throat,b12-93,vit D-17.3 ,after exposure diarrhea for one month

tb4xy1,"Seeking Ways to Help a loved one that's been diagnosed Hey, I found out a loved one is positive and just want to be able to support them and help as much as I can.. Does anyone have any advice?",5,2022-03-10 13:17:33-05:00,"You're doing a great job being a friend 💛

When my friend E shared that to us, we were at his house eating takeout. Our orders were fried chicken and a sort of jerky with rice, and the plastic utensils literally weren't going to cut it, so I asked for his silverware.

He brought two sets for me and my other friend D, who kept declining to use the silverware even when insisted. E asked, ""Why? Are you disgusted with me now?""

D was quiet, and managed to squeak, ""Am I going to be infected?""

All this to say: educate yourself and be mindful of their feelings (but avoid being patronizing too because the last thing they want is getting all the attention).

Let them know you're there for them. If they need a companion for checkups and such, If they need help looking for resources, if they need an accountability buddy (for eating healthy and exercising, for example), that they can call you.

They don't have to go through this alone, and your friend's in good company with you. ### I am piggybacking off of this, if OK? (I’ll remove if not) I don’t have a friend or loved one that is positive, but I want to be able to provide support to others / get active in communities to help educate people. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. ### Kudos to you.

I was just diagnosed a few days ago. I think you should do your best to educate yourself. Both on the medical and historical aspects of the virus. HIV carries a lot of social stigma and it’s good to know why. 

Personally, I like when people ask me questions about HIV though I understand if some people feel uncomfortable with that. Simply ask them, would you like to talk about your diagnosis? And respond to their answer accordingly.

If they’re currently ill, bringing them a little soup or something couldn’t hurt haha.

If you want to go above and beyond, educating others on the virus and condemning rude comments to help erase the stigma is great😁 ### I believe there’s opportunities to volunteer at clinics. Especially relevant if you have any medical/counseling credentials. I believe the Ryan White Care Council accepts volunteers too. 

On a social level, education is huge. The stigma from the 80s has not left, and there have been great medical strides within the last decade or so. Help people understand that undetectable folks pose exactly the same risk of transmitting the virus as someone without HIV… zero!

There’s probably wayyyy more you can do on a medical level in Central/South Africa where people are still dying from the virus. Probably not super feasible for you but something I’ve considered so thought I would mention it. ### Thank you for the response! ### ",6,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIV/comments/tb4xy1/seeking_ways_to_help_a_loved_one_thats_been/
tasdbp,"Risk in oral with bleeding gums Hi there. I've read up a lot on this and I'm still a bit unclear about what my  risk is in this scenario, and it's had me in a very anxious state across the past few months. I had a blood panel with my holistic health provider today and now have confirmation that my immune system has been ""haywire"" due to a virus which to me basically says I'm extremely likely to be HIV positive given the circumstances

&#x200B;

Back towards the end of september, I had my first and only sexual experience to this day. I met with a stranger from grindr and sucked his dick for like 20 seconds. He didn't ejaculate  in my mouth, he ejaculated in his lap afterwards, but I'm sure there was pre-cum involved while I had his penis in my mouth. My gums don't actively bleed, but they bleed if I brush my teeth with a brand new toothbrush (hard bristles). Within a week I noticed an itchy neck rash (which in hindsight I think was an eruption of hives, that lasted on my neck for a solid few weeks) and about a week after (so approx two weeks post-encounter) I had a flat torso rash that lasted for a few weeks. I didn't notice any sort of flu or sickness during this time, but I did have paresthesia  (weird tingly feeling) and diarreah for like 1 day. I had a leg pimple pop up a few weeks later and a pubic pimple (infected follicle I think?) pop up as well. Since then, so approx 3-4 months post-contact I've had random chronic hives in single spots on my neck/chest, skin feeling warmer than usual sometimes (despite no real fever), i had itchy toes for a few nights. I suspected syphilis but the timing of the rash was too early, and covid wouldn't transmit through a blowjob. Meaning HIV is really the only real option here if I was infected with something viral  during this act. I just don't understand though, I've always read that the risk was always low and even if other things rose the risk (eg sores, cuts,) it was still relatively small when it came to oral. Given the exposure, precum coming into contact with healthy gums, is the virus really that easy to transmit?  I feel like the unluckiest person in the world now. If the person is recently infected and has an extremely high viral load, then just the type of contact just not matter, you get the infection anyways??? It was barely even a blowjob, it was contact for less than half a minute, yet everyone says the virus is hard to transmit. The blood panel also picked up some heart/circulatory issues and If im reading right, HIV can cause this too, but none of this makes sense. I thought it was a slow progressing illness, yet I potentially caught it less than 4 months ago and my immune system is already fucked?",3,2022-03-10 01:23:09-05:00,"HIV doesn't have certain symptoms and it could be asymptomatic for year-and-years. In your case, only my suggestion, you don't have HIV. You don't have HIV only if you haven't had others risky sex activity BEFORE this blowjob and AFTER. In this case, your chances of getting hiv almost zero. HIV is not easily transmitted virus. Don't forget about list of others sti's which could be easily transmitted through oral sex. I don't know what are you waiting for. Go to a clinic and get tested for HIV. You will not find your results in the internet or in reddit. The only way is get tested. After your HIV negative, get tested for syphilis and ask a doctor what to do. ### I doubt you have HIV. Get a test for peace of mind and some other tests to figure out what those hives are. Your symptoms don’t really match up with that of HIV. At least for me, I had incredibly high fevers for weeks. Sure, a rash is a symptom, but that could be from anything else. Considering the odds through oral are just so low, I wouldn’t be concerned. ### You are months out from your exposure- have you tested? If not, go get tested. We can’t tell you how likely you are to have it. Your exposure risk sounds extremely low but again, you need to test to know for sure. ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIV/comments/tasdbp/risk_in_oral_with_bleeding_gums/

He claims he is negative but he tested a long time ago and refused to show me a proof of test, so I can't be too sure. We spit all over his dick, and I know saliva kills HIV. However, I have Barrett's esophagus so I was wondering if my risk is elevated because of it. He also fingered my anus. If he's positive, should I be worried?",4,2022-03-09 17:46:42-05:00,"What? No there is no way lol ### You need to recheck your facts, saliva doesn't kill HIV. ### Risk is low but not zero. Saliva doesn't kill hiv, but HIV cannot live in saliva. Air and saliva is destructive for HIV and you can't get HIV through saliva. There is no documented cases of hiv transmission for insertive partner (oral sex). There is alot of concentration of HIV in blood/body fluids, in your case, in semen(ejaculation) or pre-ejaculation. If he finished in your mouth and you have open sores, open cuts in your mouth, then you have more chances of getting hiv. There is a little risk and I think you didn't get it. You should be worried 'bout others sti's ofc if your partner have them. 
To peace your mind go and get tested for hiv in 5-6w and it would be wise not to tempt fate any further. ### The odds that he is positive seem very low, and the odds that you would contract it from oral if he were positive is 1 in 2500.

If you're just concerned that you may have HIV, you would have tested positive after 3 months.

Have you experienced any flu like symptoms? ### You should get tested for all STI’s every 6 months if you’re sexually actively. ### im not sexually active. i only had 1 sexual encounter since. 

i would say yes i experienced some ""symptoms"" but its on different days and werent really that serious.. ### yeah got it and i am not sexually acive too ### When i was in the acute stage of HIV (2-6 weeks after infection) i was for the most part in bed for 9 days. Fever, headache, chills, body aches, etc. This began on the same week i was transitioning jobs so i had to call out on my last week at my old job AND call out on my first week of my new job. But i digress.

If it's been three months and you tested negative conclusively and haven't been sexually active or otherwise engaged in risky behavior, it's unlikely that you have HIV.

Just be safe. The acute stage of HIV is miserable and the antiretroviral medication is outrageously expensive. Without insurance I'd be paying $4300/month. ### thank you so much for your input! hope you are well now! ### Hi the fever and body aches, was it too much? Or the ache was like now and then?

t9hpp1,"Worried! Please help!  Hi, lost my virginity to a girl I met on a dating app on the 28th of Feb. She performed oral on me without a condom, but I did use protection when it came to intercourse. However, I ejaculated in her mouth after.

We were talking after sex where she mentioned she was also FWBs/Seeing 5 other guys (however she did not mention if she was sexual with all of them).

This was what got me worried as they might've passed on something to her, or her to them which might be ultimately passed on to me.

Is it possible? ### you cant have or get hiv this way then, even if she had injuries on her mouth, there is not enough virus to transmit you the disease, plus you had no injuries, the virus cant transmit well when it's on saliva, maybe if it was a lot of blood, you can get tested just to feel more relaxed but you definitely dont have hiv, since, there was no way gor the virus to enter your body as there was so injury,poor healed scars or seizures, the irritated red skin doesn't count as a door for hiv ### no it's not possible and stop doing sex when you are injured there with randoms, that injured part wasn't touched by her vaginal fluids, right? ### I had oral with a sex worker few weeks ago and I'm feeling itchy do you know if its hiv? ### Not sure about vaginal fluids, it was not erect when she on sat on my penis. ### no, it's not, did you swallow him? you had open injuries or scars in your mouth,lips,throat that you could feel? ### but the condom was on, so dont worry, you cant get hiv this way, but if it helps you to relax do a generation 4th test after 7 weeks, if it's negative, no point to repeat it. ### I'm a male i was receiving

Turns out all this sub is, is people saying they are scared about contracting the virus or looking for validation that they don’t have it.

Some of the posts are so insane I remember one where a guy said he gave someone a handjob with a medical glove on and was scared he would contract the virus. THIS IS INSANE!!! A quick google search can you that you can’t contract hiv from that. It’s just really sad that the mods don’t do anything about this behavior.

His status was not listed on the hookup app, so I asked him to use a condom. We had sex for about 8 minutes total. After the first 4, he took the condom off because he said he couldn't maintain an erection. He tried again for a few minutes (maybe like 3?) and I started to feel a slight burning sensation. I noticed a bit of blood, so we stopped completely. My guess is that I likely cut myself shaving (it's happened before) or I was just really unprepared/out of practice. I don't think the guy was into me at all, so he did not really maintain an erection. He did not even come close to ejaculating (he finished from oral sex shortly afterwards), but I am still concerned given that I didn't know his status. It's been about a week and I have an upcoming doctor's appointment for an unrelated matter, so I was going to ask if I can get tested. Is it too early to do so?

I panicked thinking she would get pregnant or I will get and STD, but my friends calmed me down and said everything is alright. I kinda forgot about it.

In February 2022 my doctor did my annual check-up everything came in normal but it reminded me to get tested for HIV. Even thought I never had any symptoms, I decided to get tested without my parents knowing. I went to the hospital and booked an appointment with an urologist on 10 February 2022. He told me to get tested and sent me to the hospitals lab. They took a blood sample and did a ""Anti-HIV / p24 Antigen"" test. I was so nervous that day. After 2 hours the results were sent to me. And they came in all negative. I hugged my cat and thanked god they came back negative. Next day I had the second appointment to review the results. The doctor said there is nothing to worry and I didnt have HIV or Syphilis and the test cant be false negative.He told me to be careful and use a condom next time.

But Im still worried because was the test conclusive after 5 months of potential exposure? Maybe they mislabeled the blood samples and they tested someone else by mistake? I did some online research and learned that the latest HIV test are %99 conclusive after 3 months. And they use barcode labeling on the tubes at the hospital I went which is a private hospital not a government one. (private hospitals are generally better in Turkey because they can provide a high quality and fast service). Although Im a very chill dude generally, Im so worried and feeling very nervous about this subject. My parents don't know about any of this and I cant tell because Im a highschool student.

After hours of research about AIDS and HIV whats eating me up is the possibility of my blood specimen have been mislabeled and the negative result is not mine. I was not alone when the blood being taken and there was another man who was giving a blood sample at the same time in the room but our nurses were completely separate and it was my nurse who sticked the barcode label to my blood tube. So she didn't mixed the labels, or did she?

Should I be this worried or am I just being paranoid at this point? I cannot talk to anybody about this whole thing and I feel depressed and anxious. It's always on my mind and its tiring.

Whats your risks? Those symptoms can be lots of different things ### I recently had a hookup and performed fellatio on a male (I’m Also male) I’ve talked to him since and he said that he was tested recently and that he is clean he could be lying but he told me that. Also I heard the risks of contracting the virus are extremely low close to none by performing fellatio. Also it wasn’t protective oral sex but the person I had this interaction with did not finish inside my mouth or in my body at all. ### I dont think it was a risky exposure. If he’s clean then you have mothing to worry about and if his status is unknown the risks of oral is very low. I would wait two weeks and get tested for oral ghonorea chlamydia and herpes as well. ### I think your risk is very,very low. Try to relax. Take the test in 2-3 months time to be certain. Im sure it will be negative. But you might want to test your self for other std's. Good luck ### Will do thank you very much!

^(I am a bot and I swapp'd some of thy words with Shakespeare words.)

Commands: `!ShakespeareInsult`, `!fordo`, `!optout` ### but is the 6month necesarry tho? ive read that 6mos is outdated and testing at 3mos is conclusive. ### I don’t think you are high risk I have been told it’s almost impossible to get hiv from a woman. Are you from the uk ### Probably not, but it doesn’t hurt. I read your post history. Dude you do not have HIV. You cannot get HIV from masturbating with your own dildo. You had no exchange of body fluids with that guy. You’ve been tested a few times already. I promise you’re okay. What you can do to ease your level of risk going forward (if you will start having anal sex) is getting on PrEP. I think it’s also good practice to exchange written STD results prior to sex and to always use condoms. I tell people all the time not to just trust someone’s word they don’t have a STD. If they won’t show you their results it is a red flag 🚩 

https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/prep.html ### What is considered high risk ? ### yeah i understand. its just so fucking hard to move on with this anxiety im having. anticipating symptoms (usually shows up on my body) then i panic and i get stuck in the rabbit hole again ### From what I have been told by my doctors. Men that have sex with men. Sleeping with sex workers injecting drugs ### Have you tried seeing a therapist? They can also prescribe you some medication to help you with your anxiety. Don’t be afraid to seek a therapist. It’s nothing to be ashamed about or feel embarrassed about. ### Doesnt condoms eliminate ridk ? ### yeah i know.. its just that it hasnt been crippling me that much anymore.. i just go through random intervals of anxiety attacks that i think i can manage.. but of course i have been considering seeking mental help.. ### Yes massively ### Here’s a great place to start. They can even match you with therapists that are part of the LGBTQ community. Give it a shot. I think it will be really helpful.

I ordered the test on stdcheck.com and did the blood work at labcorp. If I’m not mistaken the 4gen looks for antigen and antibodies but your right I’m going to retest at 45 days.

Antigen is present until about 4 weeks when it then binds to the antibodies produced by your body. 

So it’s physiologically impossible for a 4th gen test to not be conclusive 6 weeks or more (and many experts say from 4 weeks on) from your exposure. 

So relax. ### What testing facility did you use because I did the same thing. I used stdcheck.com an got blood drawn from lab corp.  an both were non reactive but I’m having all symptoms as well. Just went today to get tested by my doctor an waiting on results an I’m so afraid. ### Definitely go to your doctor, but that doesn’t seem like HIV. A negative RNA test and Ag/Ab test are pretty conclusive. ### Probably covid ### I found this because i searched the word Thrush.

Had Covid over a year ago and thrush slowly formed over the year. Doctors gaslit me the whole time until they finally did a test. Came back positive for Candida Dublienesis so I also had to get an HIV test, which came back negative.

Doesn't really answer your question. But it seems related to covid and whatever it does. ### Did you test for Gonorhea and Chlamydia? You need to test urine for those. You also can get oral STDs. You need to do a oral swab. They can give you thrush issues ### Hello I'm in a somewhat similar situation, possible exposure september and I got 4th generation ab/ag done in december, it was non reactive
The person i was with I only fingered her but made the mistake of licking my fingers too

Should I retest? ### I will try to stay calm my friend. Thanks but these symptoms are still around. ### So if i took a 4th gen test 2 months post exposure should i retest? It came back negative, however all this time i have read conflicting info regarding the timing of the test and Im worried ### Yes I used STDcheck.com it’s legit tho.. bro I honestly think I got it bruh . ### I get all my test there done always. Pretty accurate. ### Why do think it something else. But symptoms are still persistent ### I did have COVID like a month ago ### I doubt that’s still Covid with all these symptoms ### Ok buddy ### During the first week I did but I haven’t since then ..can they cause such symptoms? ### You should be good… ### Those aren’t even hiv symptoms. And symptoms typically hit after 2 weeks and then you remain symptom free for years. It’s not hiv. ### Well if that website is legit an those test are accurate than we should be good but I’m in the same boat as you. I have fully convinced myself I have it. Scared asf dude. ### I would hope so man cuz I’ve gotten so many non reactive test back that I want to believe I don’t have HIV but I’m having all the symptoms and it is really scaring me. ### The only thing that would make me think I don’t is I guess a non reactive test at 3 months but I still have a whole month to make it through before I hit the 3 month mark so it’s just gonna be worry until then. ### An acute HIV infection usually presents with fever, body rash, swollen lymph nodes (particularly in the neck), fatigue, headache, GI upset. Some people get a few symptoms, some don’t get any at all. Also, symptoms usually don’t last for a month in the acute phase.

Thrush is also not very common in the first stage of HIV infection as well. 

The main reason why it seems to be something else is because both your test are negative. A negative RNA test after 30 days is pretty sensitive. Ab/Ag tests (the generation tests) vary in their window, but I would say yours is okay. 

So I’m pretty certain it’s not HIV, but you definitely should get checked for whatever else you’ve got. ### huh? ### Yes. Get oral swabbed for Gonorhea, Syphillis, etc. It’s becoming a bigger thing now. If you perform oral sex. It’s a good possibility it’s that. Also retest your urine. Check for Chlamydia and Gonorhea. ### I was confused as I was having your same symptoms and was thinking maybe i tested early but then found out my test was a 4th gen ab/ag combo assay which is supposed to be reliable so i got confused ### I don’t see what else it can be because I already have hsv1/2 since 2018 .. I don’t see what else would cause all these symptoms fam ### Are you a doctor? I’d be careful giving everyone doctorly advice so confidently if you are not. Some people actually take the shit they read on the internet serious ### I also did an rna pcr I’ll update you once that come in .. I did both the 4th gen /rna ### Ohk we’ll see thanks on the reply but I’m convinced that’s what it is . Thanks for your words ###  I meant to say okay thank you for the information ### Ohk I will do so I been so focused on HIV I’m not going to lie because of all those symptoms… I’ve been doing RNA test and 4th generation.. ### Yes you should be good if you did a test after 90 you’re definitely good ### Good luck homie ### [deleted] ### Thanks bruvy you can pm me anytime bro ### My results for hiv qualitative rna just came back  non reactive after 48days .along with 4th gen test.. ### What do you mean by that buddy? ### [deleted] ### Well tested negative again at 47 days so I’m hoping I’m good but i still feel like shit so idk what’s going on with me. ### That sounds like your in the clear bro.

But I know he kind of sleeps around, i’ve been so anxious and I’m waiting until I can make an appt to get tested, but I don’t even know if it will show up because it’s only been like 3 weeks.

To put the risk of transmission into perspective, **IF** you came into contact with someone who was positive, *and* they had a high viral load, the risk of contracting it varies by the type of act. 

When not using condoms - The riskiest scenario for infection, is receptive anal sex. (Bottoming)
- The relative risk for this is 1.9% 
- If the person was newly infected (first 6-12 weeks), which is when they are most infectious, the risk increases sevenfold and goes to 13%. 
- **The risks for all other sexual acts fall dramatically below this.** For more stats you can check out this [relative risk table.](https://www.aidsmap.com/about-hiv/estimated-hiv-risk-exposure)

- we also know that [when HIV is undetectable, it’s untransmittable.](https://www.catie.ca/positive-side/uu)

 [Condoms are also highly effective at preventing HIV infection](https://www.catie.ca/condoms-for-the-prevention-of-hiv-transmission) - so in the future, consider having protected sex to avoid this anxiety. PrEP is also an option.

I am a Male 18 year old, Ive been experimenting but only been getting receptive oral aside from the last two times. Im pretty much at the point where I’m done with the experimenting. Not really into it, but the last two times have made me nervous.

First time was with a man on PreP, I was receptive bottom. He had no condom on, never ejaculated. It scared me, and he was rough. Not a great experience, I felt bad afterwards and got sick a week after with a cold and got freaked out. I started thinking I had HIV even after reaserching. As I type this out I realize that that encounter was probably nothing to worry about. I ended up reaching out again to confirm he was on PreP and negative.

This second time was similar except I was the top. Not forced but not what I wanted, I was in the guy for very little. I did not ejaculate to my knowledge.The guy said he was clean. I assume most people will say the truth… But again.

For convenience I performed the test with period blood , at first only one line

I started shaking and repeated the test pricking my finger this time. I got a negative test fearing it was for blood being insufficient but...meanwhile the first test turned negative and positive line disappeared.

Two weeks after that (so three months after vaginal sex  with unknown status partner) i did another rapid test and got a negative result .

I can't live well anymore due the first test, I remember the blood getting cold, the head spinning and whole body shaking . I check for symptoms everyday (I have a white tongue and that's it but I don't remember if I had it before Ecc)

I think they can go as tight as 10 days. I knew I was sick as I had acute symptoms (really sick flu like) within 10 days. My initial VL was beyond the test limit of 10,500,000 copies. So I had a LOT of virus in me .. which means I probably got it from a highly infective person and then I was tested at my peak.

st2v3k,"So I tested positive I've seen a lot of posts here where people say:

* ""I did risky thing .. am I safe?""  

So I thought I'd post my own little story, here from icy Finland.

I generally test myself for STDs once every few years.  I've never been terribly risky so I just did it for my own peace of mind.  Unprotected oral?  Yes, quite often.  Unprotected sex?  No.  Sex with hookres? no.  Sex with men?  No.

So it was quite a surprise when I got a phone call from the private-clinic I'd booked to say I was positive for HIV.  I'd gone in-person to give blood samples to be used for testing for various things.  So there was no talk about false-positives, or retesting.  (Maybe they retest the samples if they get a positive result?  Maybe the blood-tests are just ""good"").

Phone call was a bit brutal, as I was a little shocked.  But the results-guy told me ""Expect a letter from the local hospital soon - they'll want to see you in the next week or two"".

Sure enough I got an SMS a week later informing me of two appointments in the next week:

* One appointment to give (21!) blood samples.
  * Apparently being used to detect a) viral load, and b) to see what drugs I'll be using.
* Another appointment 10 days later to talk to a doctor, once the results were ready.

I went and got an EKG (not sure why), gave the blood samples, and gave a urine sample.  Everybody was very friendly ""You might find you live even longer with HIV!!!  We'll be seeing you every six months or so and can detect cancer as part of our testing!!""

Everybody also kept saying ""Normal Life"" too many times.  Doctor gave me magical pills, and we check back in a couple of months.  The assumption is that I'm ""good"" as my levels were low - that kinda implies I've had it for a while, rather than acquired it very very recently.

In the future?  I guess I'll switch to the ""once every two month"" injections, rather than having to take pills.

Questions welcome.  All the treatment was free, as you'd expect from the Finnish government.  All the providers were friendly and mellow.  I'm a bit disappointed in myself for getting it in the first place, but I guess the way I've been dealt with has been better than I'd have expected.",16,2022-02-15 08:23:47-05:00,"This is a bizarre one.

There’s a few studies that recently came out saying there’s been people having false positives for HIV after contracting Covid. If that is you you should really look into it. good luck and God bless. Regardless of your status I promise you you’re going to be OK ### So you got it from oral? ### First off, sorry that you got the news like that, I can imagine the shock. Second, you're right! They will mention the ""Normal life"" part. And it's true for most of it, the illness is more manageable than a diabetes, for example. 

Glad to hear you're dealing the whole thing just fine! Have you told anyone about your diagnosis? I'm always scared of that part because of the prejudice that is implied, people is still not well educated about it, at least in my country... ### Do you have herpes by any chance? I’ve heard antibodies can react w/ the test. This is a bit odd ### I'm sorry,but i just dont buy into you,as a male getting it from oral. Something does not add up here ### Any symptoms you had? Like really bad flu. High grade fever. Extreme tiredness? ### Yeah I did a lot of reading/research after the initial ""you're positive"" phone call, and saw people say there's essentially zero recorded cases of people getting it from oral.  (I guess because most people that do unprotected oral also do unprotected sex.)

I guess either I'm very very unlucky, and genuinely did catch it from giving/receiving oral, or I'm forgetting a broken condom or two, over the years!  But even that makes me surprised - incidents of HIV infection in this country are relatively low.  So I'd say the odds of catching it from unprotected sex, say ten times in five years, are also freakishly low. ### >My question to you is have you received a Covid vaccine recently or got Covid?

Literally 90% of the people in this country have had one/both of those things.

I'd be curious to read those studies, but I guess when the viral-load results come back it'll be obvious if I have a false-positive or not.  For the moment nobody here has even discussed the possibility of a false-positive. ### Maybe.  

Or possibly there was a broken condom, or two, over the years which I just don't remember.

Impossible to know, though neither feel terribly likely.  Nothing else springs to mind though - no tattoos, no (drug) needles, no bareback. ### Thank-you!

So far I've not told anybody.  I guess that's something I'll have to consider for the future.  Right now I'm mostly just not thinking about having sex, and thinking in a few months I might reinstall tinder, once my viral loads are stable and continue to be low.

I did consider going to a meetup for [hiv positive people](https://www.positiiviset.fi/), but I'm not yet decided. ### Nope, got a full set of tests for ""everything"", and HIV was the only thing that showed up.

&#x200B;

I'll get the results of the all the blood-tests shortly, and my initial set of medication.  I don't expect it's a false-positive, but I guess if it was then the samples will show zero viral-load and it'll be obvious then. ### Yeah I can't help thinking that either I was very unlucky, or I've forgotten something.

I guess the two options are:  


* I got it from oral.
* Or despite always having safe-sex there was an accident (broken condom) sometime in the past year or two which I've just genuinely forgotten.

  
I had the interview with the nurse and she said ""Do you have any symptoms?"" and I said, quite honestly, ""If I had flu-like symptoms for a week that went away, even with swollen nodes .. I'd not remember a month later"".  I'd certainly not think ""Ooh STD"" ### Nothing, the nurse asked me that too.

But to be honest if I had the flu for a week two years ago, say, I'd not even remember it.  

I've been single and having random hookups/brief relationships with people met from tinder and online for the past few years.  Always safe.   I might have had an accident over the years, but I genuinely can't rememeber any.  Nor can I remember being unwell at any point - I always think of myself as being pretty healthy, I don't get colds in winter, nor have I had any other real issues in my life.

ssv3v8,help pretty sure I have HIV. I am a 37 year old female and I was having sex unprotected with a male that has HIV. He is on the medicine to keep him from being infected and from showing up positive. (I'm sorry I don't know how to explain). His is a alcoholic and forgets to take it a lot. I didn't know he had ever tested positive until it was too late. Anyways I have dentures and they sometimes cause these sores in my mouth. He was kissing he felt something. Turned the lights on and he had a horrible nose bleed. So that blood was all in my mouth with these sores. Fast forward I found out and went to the doctor and told her I had unprotected sex but was scared about the HIV part. I figured they would test for HIV as part of the workup. That was maybe 11 months ago. No HIV results on the results I got back. HPV and the STDs only. Which was all negative. Here we are 8 months later and I have been having SEVERE pains all over my body. So bad my hands and feet can't be moved because of severe pain. Doctor called me today and said she thought it was rhuematiod arthritis but it wasn't and every month for the past few my inflammation markers keep going up. She wants me to see a rhuematologist. I know I should have told her and I'm going to at my next appointment. But what do you guys think? It's driving me crazy and giving me anxiety bad.

sso8ix,"Should I test for hiv even though I had my 3rd dose of the covid vaccine just last week? I have bad anxiety and I now believe I might have caught hiv some time ago. I‘m 21/F from europe and I had a phase where I used to have a lot of sex when I was 18.

I always used a condom but I think it might have ripped a few times. I was more worried about pregnancy than catching anything else back then, which is stupid, I know, I just wasn’t educated.
I don’t remember ever having flu like symptoms or a rash, but I do frequently catch colds.

But that’s besides the point, I wanted to get tested asap so I ordered a at home test kit. 

I wanted to ask if anyone knows if my booster vaccine that I got last week could impact the hiv test? I know that these tests are highly sensitive, so is there a possibility that it could show up false positive because my immune system is working on building covid antibodies?

sso6b8,"Worry about Acute HIV Symtomp 10 days ago, I had a dry hump with prostitute while she wore a thin silk pajamas pant. I had no cloths, wear condom entire time and it wasnt broke.

I touched her top skin, but we didnt have oral sex or kiss, it lasted about 5 - 10 minutes.

However, there are warts on my penis base for few years, so I fear those warts may contact with her fluid through the pant while dry hump (I dont know there was fluid or not, just scare now).

This is first exposure since I test 3 months ago (negative). I will test again after 2 weeks (4th gen test).

ssgwpo,How accurate is the oraquick test? Does anyone have experience? I had somewhat of an exposure scare six weeks ago. A few people on here told me not to worry the risk is low but I still want to get tested to be safe. I bought the Oura quick testing today and I just took it waiting on results. But the package says you shouldn’t take the test until after three months of possible exposure. It’s been 6 weeks for me. I can’t wait another 6 weeks to take the test my anxiety won’t allow tjay lol. My question is are these results no way going to be accurate? Let’s say is it going to be 85% accurate instead of 99% accurate? Can the test find antibodies in my blood after six weeks of possible exposure? Thank you,17,2022-02-14 13:00:43-05:00,"I know it’s going to be hard on your anxiety, but wait the full recommended time frame before you take the OraQuik test. And yes, they are accurate at detecting the antibodies. Very accurate test. But, also do a blood test at your PCP just to confirm whatever result your OraQuik test gives you. Try to relax. ### Dude, go to your primary Doctor and ask him/her to do a 4th gen ag/ab blood draw sent to lab test. You can get this done this week and have results back early next week. 

Those tests are the gold standard and will provide conclusive results 6 weeks or more from the time of exposure. ### Stop paying for home tests. Get a blood test after 3 months , if symptoms repeat at 6 months ### I took the test today and it came out negative. does that mean I should still be cautious and not be sexually active until another six weeks and I retake the test? I went to the clinic today but due to Covid their new system is ridiculous so I opted to pay the $50 and buy the at home test. I really hope I didn’t get my hopes up for nothing seeing the negative test today ### Is the Oraquick oral swab self test accurate and conclusive? ### Thank you I’ll look into it ### I would test again in 6 weeks just to be sure but I am pretty sure you’re good. Did you get a persons blood on your during intercourse or something? Why do you think you may have been exposed? ### Yes it is. ### So I don’t really want to say because I don’t want to be judged and  just called crazy and paranoid. Long story short I received oral from a sex worker and ended up having a cut it was bleeding after wards. I would never be concerned from receiving oral because I had to cut I’ve been worried since ### When? ### At what timeframe is it conclusive? ### If you can’t wait another 6 weeks ask your clinic for a NAT( nucleic acid test) test. That test is the best way to detect the virus in your dna. It’s window period is 10-33 days after exposure so whatever results you get from that test it’ll be extremely accurate. Look at the cdc website for more test options and best of luck. Ik god will help you get through it my friend 🙏🏽 ### Well, it is nearly impossible to contract HIV from receiving oral sex, even if you had a cut. In order for you to have been infected: 

-She would have to be infected with HIV and not on ART (medicine that lowers the HIV viral load).

-She would have to be bleeding profusely from the mouth while your penis had an open wound on it.

-The enzymes in saliva kill HIV, making this extremely difficult (nearly impossible) to happen. 

I’d say 100% you’re okay, but do test again in about 6-8 weeks just to be absolutely certain. I did the same thing you did! ### Oh JFC. Saliva kills hiv on contact. You had a zero risk event. Move on. ### Thank you so much god bless ### Thank you very much. This calmed my anxiety. I also want to be sexually active but I want to be safe and responsible ### I would never be worried but due to me being cut there’s a small possibility.

ssez7u,"Need an advice Hello, I have no idea how reddit works but here I am, idk what to do, I'm lost.

So I'm 14, becoming 15 next month, and I've been living with my sister for the past year because my mom is an Alcoholic.

When I was little my dad was an alcoholic and my mom kicked him out, he wasn't really helping around the house, and wasn't really working either, and my mom had to work 3 jobs just to take care of me and my siblings ( my two sisters and one brother) which by the time I was born were 13, 14 and 16 or sum like that, and also my grandfather who had lost his leg and he wasn't able to walk so my mother needed to take care of him too.
My father was kind of pervert , once, when I was sleeping in the same bed as my parents he touched my private parts. Ew I don't even wanna get into that. 
My mom kicked him out when I was 5.
Then when I was 7 or sum she started this job as a social worker and she got this paralyzed client who's Alcoholic, she started to become good friends with him and all and then she started to drink with him, and then my grandfather died, and the drinking got worse, with time she would start to get abusive towards me, she would yell at me when shes drunk, hit me ( not always tho) and other things.
The abuse got worse  when I was 12 or 13 i think and that's when she started to physically abuse me, its hard to remember cuz it's all blurred but yeah. 

I was depressed really depressed, cuz of that whole situation and abuse thing.
My mom often would be at that man's house for weeks, drinking with him while I was alone at home, sometimes i was low on food, but the fridge was never completely empty.
But for some times she would be drinking at home and if she drank up to like a week she would get hallucinations and become crazy n shit cuz like all shes been having in her organism for a week is a fucking vodka so its obvious that her brain is gonna get fucked up, soo she would do crazy things like, almost peeing in a shoe, thinking that her paralyzed friend is at our house while theres no one there, and if I don't get him to her she would get angry
But don't think that I'm a saint, I talk back a lot, I used to disrespect her and call her names when shes sober, and I just can't stand her when shes drunk so sometimes I talked back and my talking back sometimes led the whole situation into a physical fight in which I wasn't fighting back of course.
Sometimes I would play friendly and just try to calm her down......
Shes really bipolar when shes drunk, one moment shes crying, the second shes laughing and third shes throwing things and yelling.
Shes really nice when shes sober tho,that makes me forgive her and I could never hate her.

Okay let's move on, yall know the backstory 

Sooooooooooooooo last February we thought her drinking problem was slowly going away so my brother decided to help her on one condition- that she'll stop drinking and stop inviting my father over( yeah she sometimes would do that, just so she has a company, somebody to drink with, he got diagnosed with aids 2 or 3 years ago and we were afraid that they were fuckin***) 

So my brother bought our house  a new door, gave me money to buy food, things for myself and also help my mom and buy her something when she needs and etc..
But then this one time she called my father over cuz something had happened and she needed somebody to help, ok he helped us, but after he helped us she didn't tell him to go, she told him to fucking stay and go to the store and buy something to drink......
And that's when I told my brother and he gave up on her ( maybe I shouldn't have done that)

But in the morning I packed a couple of my things and went to my sisters house, after a week of my mom trying to get me home, she finally did, I walked home I didn't even undress I just lied in my bed( that's when she asked if I'm okay) until it was time to go to sleep then I brushed my teeth and just went to sleep and in the morning I had online classes so I did them and by the time I finished my mom was drifting to sleep by a tv  in her room, I asked if I could go visit my other sister, she said yes, so when she fell asleep I packed my things and went to my sisters house, but my mom didn't know that i wont come back..
I still remember how peacefully she was sleeping, I still fucking wish I didn't go that day.

And then after like 1 month with living with my sister I got my mom to get tested for hiv, and I fucking promised her that I wont leave her even if she had it... 
she tested positive....
So my sister that I live with at the moment she told me that I shouldn't go back home  cuz of the hygiene and shit and that anything could happen and that I can get it too, etc.

Its been almost a year and I still wanna go home but my mom is still drinking and the surrounding at my house have gotten worse, my mom had homeless guys over her there, they slept in my bed etc., theres also been a rumour that she has bed bugs which probably arent true but anyways.
And due to all that my sister and her bf doesn't like me going over there so I basically am not allowed to visit her.
Only outdoors.
My sister also yells at me and emotionally abuses me, idkkk its just a lot
My mom would never treat me like my sister does when shes sober so idk what to do.....
Ofc a lot of details are missing and plus my English sucks here, cuz I'm stressed but anyways
I need some kind of advice....
PS.
My sister has two kids so I often have to watch them and If I sometimes say no she yells at me
For an example if I'm doing my homework, I have to drop it and watch her kids, if I don't she yells at me.
She sometimes wont allow me go out. She gets jealous when I go out with my other sister...
She calls me dumb, lazy, she always judges my  style ,my music, she says that I won't go far in life, and other mean things. Even if my mom is an Alcoholic she never said something like that to me... 
She also invaded my personal space my reading my journal where I often write how i feel and what's on my mind. She read the suicidal notes and then she called me crazy.... etc ..
Ofc she supports me too but like it's the mean things that get to my head..

Do yall think I should go home?

Perhaps think about your words before saying them next time. ### What the hell you worrying about then probably got the flu or corona probably ### The flu like symptoms will be the first indication that you may have HIV and it puts you down for about a week, although sometimes it can be asymptomatic.

Be careful who you mess around with, use protection, get on PrEP, get tested regularly and insist that your potential partners do the same and you'll be alright. I was stupid and thought it would never happen to me, and then it did.

sq10a2,"NAT test accuracy after 31 days? Hello everyone, 
I’ve been on this page for a while and I have so much anxiety about my possible exposure. A month ago, I was at a nightclub and got way too intoxicated and blacked out. I woke up in my truck by a women knocking on my window. She was asking for some money and I said I would give her $20 for some head. Biggest mistake of my life, because she agreed and since I was still super drunk I didn’t think of the red flags. Just received oral , didn’t cum, and I didn’t have any other kind of sex, just oral. I woke up the next day with a rash that didn’t itch nor blisters appear. I went to get an viral culture/std test and blood draw 3 days after and the std test came back negative and the only thing found in my blood was hsv1 and the culture test found a bacterial infection, Entercoccus faelis. Two weeks after, I made another appointment with a health department and they did the same routine. Viral culture and blood draw from the vein. Everything came back normal and they didn’t find anything, not even hsv1. However, I’ve been having symptoms of HIV after the 2 weeks. I got knee pain, mild night sweats, sore throat, some pimples appeared on my back, some muscle aches, and my temp was at 99 but nothing higher, and my lymph node under my right ear is a bit swollen but that’s it. I went to the doctor on 2/11  and he told me that my acne and lymph node was related to my bacterial infection and he told me he seriously doubted I had HIV. I requested an RNA test and I’m waiting on the results, and the Docter was confident it was my anxiety that was causing the symptoms. My question is what are the chances I do have HIV?",11,2022-02-11 09:44:05-05:00,"Hi first at all hsv1 and enterococcus faecalis can be very common even in people who has never had sex. Second HIV doesn't have specific symptoms. The rash the fever the lymph can be for any other microorganism who's more easy to catch than hiv.

I wouldn’t even test for that. I wouid however test for gon. Chlamidia and herpes. ### Thank you so much for the ray of hope. I’ve been in such a dark place mentally, and your words of encouragement help so much. I’ve been looking at cdc and the symptoms so I assumed. The rash hasn’t gone away after a month of amoxicillin and cream. I’m just super anxious but thank you for your help🙏🏽.

My body just feels different and it’s making me super anxious, and on top of that when I work out my face gets really pale. It’s never done that before in my life and I was told I looked white, I’m Mexican, and so I knew hiv can cause that as well. I’m still waiting on my results from an rna test. ### Anything else, if the risk was about a month ago, you don't need RNA test, are really expensive. An conventional ELISA 4th generation test is enough. Anyways if you have the money maybe ARN give u more peace ### Dude, saliva kills hiv on contact. It’s literally impossible to acquire hiv in that fashion. ### I didn’t know about the Elisa 4th generation test, Ik the NAT test are accurate and idk how expensive it’s going to be. What’s more accurate for a month test? Most health clinics I went to told me I needed to re test in 3-6 months. However cdc stated that NAT tests can detect the virus 10-33 days. Thank you so much for all the important information! I really appreciate it and it helps ease my mind🙏🏽 ### NAT is even more accurate, and 15 days conclusive. 4th elisa 28 days conclusive. More than 3 month was for test realize 10 years ago. ### Ok perfect. I’ll update this post when I get my results in! I’m praying everyday that my results will come back normal and now all I have to do is wait. Thank you for your information once again. ### I just got my results today 2/14 and it was negative. It wasn’t a NAT test because the clinic didn’t use the correct testing tube so they did a 4th generation antigen/antibody test. I’m getting the NAT test tomorrow with the correct tube. How accurate is the 4th generation test after 31 days of exposure? Idk if it was an elisa 4th generation tho ### Is really I've never have seen a seroconvertion after a negative in first month.

Right after the encounter, I was thinking how stupid I was and started to get worried.  The next day I started to have a headache and 2 days after that I started to have low temperature at around  35,5 °C /  95,9 °F. Still have the headache and my temperature is still jumping around, but it's about normal now. I feel like I'm going crazy, called in sick at work and kind of isolated myself this week not knowing what to do.  I read that symptoms should start around 2-4 weeks after the encounter, mine started after 3 days. Are those symptoms, or am I just overreacting. I already have a lab test appointment date in the 6th week, but I feel like I'm going to go crazy till then.

Men better think about covid ### Go to the official CDC website. They have a calculator that assess the exposure risk. From everything I've read getting it from oral Is incredibly rare. To add to that getting it from heterosexual contact is also incredibly rare. If you still freaking out and live in the US you could get tested within 10 days with a HIV RNA test and get decently accurate results. I used the website STDCHECK.com. Overall try not to worry yourself the chances of HIV in your case is near to none. So many people freak out and let anxiety rule them and amazingly your mind can send your body into a weird place. Alot of people come here scared for HIV even tho the encounter was not high risk. Thus I believe this is due to guilt. Everyone has a conscious whether we like it or not we do stuff and somewhere in the back of our mind it makes us worry due to guilt. Just repeat after me you are human and you make mistakes no you don't deserve HIV due to those mistakes. With all that said I wouldn't rule out other infections . ### Already got tested for covid and I was negative. Idk I'm just so worried this is messing me up really bad I can barely sleep. ### Thank you, yeah I guess guilt also plays a huge part in this but your words helped ease my mind a little bit.

If you believe you have been exposed, obtain a test (lab or at home) specifically designed for HIV at least 4 weeks after your last high-risk encounter, and again after 90 days from the encounter. 

You can not diagnose HIV by symptoms or unrelated tests. ### Get an HIV test ### What was your exposure? ### Get an Hiv test. Why rely on a cbc ### lol my doctor said the same lol but I’m not sure what it is 😭😭 ### What made you realize it was allergic reaction ### What do you mean ? ### Why would you recommend that of what information from this image ###  Not sure if I was just wondering ### Not sure about what? Basophils are high those cells are high if u have chronic allergy or intestinal parasites. Not a virus. Chill you are negative ### Because the OP obviously is concerned about HIV so why not just get an HIV test ???? ### Ok. Can’t have HIV without being exposed to HIV 😉 ### So what are the gran% what contribute to them being low ? ### I assume I was 🤷🏽‍♂️ ### It doesn't work that way. However those results are completely normal it doesn't suggest a serious illness. ### What do you mean you assume you were? You either were or you weren’t. Did you have an unprotected sexual exposure meaning vaginal or anal? Did you use a dirty needle? Because outside of that you weren’t exposed. 

As others have mentioned, if you are concerned then get tested. Get a 4th generation blood draw sent to a lab by your primary doctor. Any test done 6 weeks or more from the exposure will be 100% accurate at that point.

In fact, those tests are 100% accurate anytime 6 weeks + after the exposure. 

Furthermore, It is not physiologically possible for a human to not produce antibodies at that point nor would it be possible for the antigen (particles of HIV virus present) component of the test to indicate negative if in fact there were antigen present (the antigen peaks around 4 weeks and then binds to the antibodies, so the 4th gen test is designed to provide an indication of negative/positive as early as 4 weeks and certainly after 6 weeks). 

You se good. Believe the science. ### Hey everyone, I hope this is allowed. Here’s my HIV test results. I got tested 116 days after unprotected sex. I got tested by blood work through a vein. Is this a 4th Gen test, and is this accurate? Thanks!

Back in the 90’s it might take 6 mths based on testing technology used. At this point the testing technology has evolved to the point that these tests are the most medically accurate tests available. 

The CDC is an incredibly conservative organization and even they indicate 3 months is conclusive. Organizations like that just are not putting out 3 months as the max timeframe if there were any chance it takes 6 mths. If that were the case legally, they would have to indicate 6 mths. ### ",2,https://i.redd.it/wq83smc6evg81.jpg

I’m going to get tested. I don’t know how to feel. Help! This happen two months ago.,7,2022-02-07 16:49:56-05:00,"No risk. There have never been any documented cases of HIV through oral. ### 99% chance you're fine. Any cuts in your mouth when it happened? ### Yes there have been.  Please stop spreading misinformation.

Were you alive during the 1970s and 1980s or 1990s? Not every single bisexual and gay man who got infected with HIV, got infected with HIV from only anal sex. I know several men who were infected from giving oral sex. They were infected with HIV this way as they were not into anal sex and did not do it, or the very small number of times they did anal sex they were giver/aktiv/top and condoms were used correctly and always.

Getting oral sex is super low risk but it has happened that way when someone has a cut or broken skin on their genitals, or if they have herpes or HPV and the person giving them oral sex is HIV+. HIV infection from oral sex generally happens from someone giving oral sex, and usually swallowing cum or taking cum in the mouth, and they have a cut or sore or broken skin in their mouth.

Get tested original poster, for HIV, all other STDs, and COVID. ### I’m pretty sure that I had read in a few places there weren’t any documented cases of oral. Period. As it was near impossible to isolate an incidence since people are more likely to also have been engaging In Other activities. 

I did come across this in my quick search right now, which would mean I was definitely incorrect. - “Because condomless fellatio allows body fluids from one person to come into contact with the mucosal tissues or open cuts, sores or breaks in the skin of the other person, there is a “theoretical risk” of HIV transmission—meaning that passing an infection from one person to another is considered possible. But the likelihood of it happening is rare, as there are only a few documented cases.

These cases all involved MSM who were giving condomless oral sex to HIV-positive men. No cases of HIV transmission have been reported among female partners giving condomless oral sex. And there hasn’t been a single documented case of transmission to a partner getting condomless oral sex, either among MSM or heterosexuals.” [(CATIE)](https://www.poz.com/basics/hiv-basics/hiv-transmission-risks)

But I am confused, I had written about this in a thesis for school and used a few official peer reviewed referenced that spoke about no documented cases. Now I think my whole life is a lie. Is this a mandala effect? ### Yes there's documented cases but never one by single contact, requires multiple oral contacts, and still be really really improbable. You should be the one who must stop of scary people here looking for support. ### Yes there have been cases where someone got Pozzed from giving oral sex to someone who is HIV+ or living with AIDS.  I know men who became Poz this way and their HIV or infectious disease doctors confirmed they were infected from giving oral, as these men were monogamous with a guy who is Poz, and they only did oral sex.  There are cases where someone got Pozzed from getting oral a friend became Poz from being sucked as the man sucking him off in a sex bar cut my friend's cock with his teeth and my friend got Pozzed from having a cut or broken skin.  I know men who were picky and they only sucked cock at a sauna and did it to just one guy that night or day who was their type and got Pozzed from sucking cock.

Science and medicine, as well as studying HIV for decades with people's real life experiences with the way they became HIV+ tells us that while giving oral sex is low risk for HIV it is not zero percent or less than 1%, and it is more actually like 5%.

There is a massive amount of misinformation about HIV being spread here on reddit. I have read people writing about how it is in their personal opinion 'very rare or impossible for anyone to be infected with HIV from giving oral sex or that HIV infection from a Poz woman to a neg man having unsafe sex, or a neg man having unsafe sex a Poz bottom simply cannot happen from a single sexual encounter'. When in reality tops who fuck women or men unsafe do get Pozzed, and so do people who are or were neg give oral to people who are poz. Is it at the rate bottoms and women and IV drug users get Pozzed, of course not but that does not mean that it is statistically impossible, improbable, or rare to get HIV from giving oral sex, from woman to man, or from bottom/passiv to top/giver. ### Science isn't about your personal experience an expectations.

It’s been 5 months since I had unprotected sex. I am in such a state. So please can I have some advice. ### I was like that about 3 months ago. Had unprotected sex. Then started feeling some weird twitching/vibrations between my testicles. It was mad weird, I thought the worse. My anxiety went through the roof. Talk about thinking about it almost all day and night. I'm very laid back and chill. Never had that type of anxiety in my life. The twitching later on spread to my arms, legs and other parts of my body that never had twitching before. Once again, I thought the worse. Got tested 1 month after exposure with 4gen and it was negative. That wasn't enough for me. I paid out of pocket for a whole std package, including fast highly accurate hiv test after 2 months of first test. It was also negative. Then, I slowly started to lower my anxiety levels. The twitching in my balls dramatically decrease, but still have it a lot a lot less. 
Anxiety can do a lot of physiological damage. 
To make matters worse, my body was stuck in a fight or flight state afterwards. I guess my subconscious mind still was traumatized, like I was having PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder).
I would wake up at the middle of the night with a little of a fast pulse. I felt like I never went to sleep. I was having this episodes about 4-5 nights in a row. I got sleep deprived, I started shaking.
I'm telling you, Anxiety is no joke. Specifically high levels.

And if you wanna bang someone raw in a committed relationship, both need to get tested. ### Anxiety can fuck your body up. I did the same thing. Then I got a sore throat and went bat shit crazy. I found a clinic that was open on a Saturday and did a rapid test.  Then a month later which would have been 90 days I did another test then a week after I did another test. All negative. 90 days post is conclusive. ### Does anybody know if stdcheck.com is a reliable website to get test from because i have taken 2 from them an both were clean but I feel like I’m having symptoms and have been scared for almost 2 months now. ### Thank you;( I am so worried honestly.

I'm on Pep pills after the condom broke when I was having sex with a confirmed HIV positive female. I'm stressed. I'm having a sore throat. I can't help but wonder if it's the early symptoms of HIV. ### I’d do it just to make sure. If they come back negative they should be pretty conclusive. ### If you have a HIV clinic near you I would go there and speak w/ them. I don’t know everything but what I learned from my mistake is for one obviously use protection and 2 do not google. I started googling and going crazy and I was not sleeping my body went to shit. I was in the clinic shaking and crying but the guy who did my test talked to me and calmed me down. My situation is a bit different. Him and I were talking and possibly going to start dating but after the first date and one night of sex I realized I didn’t like him at all but then he admitted to doing some weird shit that involved me over 10 years ago (we had been friends for years prior to this) and my mind spiraled I convinced myself he had every STD known to man and convinced myself I had it. ### ",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIV/comments/slzom1/please_can_i_have_some_advice_i_had_unprotected/

So the thing is that I am worried I might have HIV, on may of 2021 I had unprotected sex with a guy and he gave me chlamydia and ureaplasma, didnt do any oral sex wit him, but I got those two stds treated and then in september I had unprotected oral sex with another man. A few days after that encounter I started having a sore throat that ended up going away like three weeks after. Then, the 2nd of january of this year I had oral sex with other dude and a week later I started having a sore throat again. I still have it today but sometimes it goes away and then it cames back. This time when I did the oral sex I actually had a little sore in my mouth but he didnt ejaculate in my mouth. What are the chances that I might have HIV from this encounters? I am going to get tested but my doctor told me to wait until march and I need to ease my mind until then. I know it can also be syphilis so in that case can I go get tested for that now that its been a month or do I need to wait for longer? thank you so much!!",8,2022-02-03 16:39:04-05:00,"When was last COVID vaccine?

This looks to me a reactivated EBV!

Now you have completed a month from the last exposure, get tested by 4th gen, now it would give you at least 95% accurate result as per the UK guidelines.

6 weeks weeks is conclusive as per UK, US, and CDC, so you could wait for another two weeks and make it one single final conclusive test by then. ### Anyway, the risk of catching HIV from and oral encounter is so minimal. ### my last covid vaccine was the 2nd of september. I am going to get tested by blood but i have no idea if its a 4th gen or what it is. Its the same blood work as the one for syphilis and hepatitis and all of that… ### My doctor told me that I would have to wait until march so thats why I am not too sure. I am in Spain. I have bought the one that gets the blood from your finger because that one is accurate when 3 months have passed and my last unprotected vaginal sex was in may of last year and thats the one I am most worried about… ### If you are worried about the vaginal exposure that has happened in may last year, by now the finger brick test is highly accurate.

If you are worried about your last oral exposure last Jan and can’t wait 90 days (till march) then make a 4th gen lab test after two weeks and close the chapter with note that the oral exposure isn’t a very risky behavior for HIV transmission. Of course this is in case your partner is infected and not under the therapy. ### I dont think that he is infected because he actually donates blood twice a year and If he had anything he would know, but I dont even know him that much actually to know when was the last time he donated blood or when his last sexual encounter was. 

I have read so many things on the internet. Some of them saying how you can get HIV through oral sex and others saying how is impossible even if you have sores in your mouth. I dont even know what to believe anymore.

Thank you so much for your response. ### You will be all well, since the sore throats are not consistent and you don’t experienced any other symptoms it’s most likely not HIV.

if u want to rule out hiv, **use the correct test.**  4th gen.  a 4th gen at 33 days isn't considered very conclusive but the pep doesn't make it less conclusive.  like 95% of positives will be positive on 4g by 30 days.  that means like 5% won't.  is that 'conclusive enough'?  that's up to u.  no test is ever 100% conclusive.  u decide if 33 days is conclusive enough to move on. ### I was told 6 weeks after PEP with a fourth gen is conclusive by most experts, but my anxiety made me get tested at 3 months as well.

shnveo,HIV vs AIDS transmission? I was trying to research this online but couldn’t find anything that said one way or another. Is it easier to catch HIV from someone who has progressed to AIDS? Are there any sources that touch on this? Thanks in advance!,2,2022-02-01 01:10:01-05:00,"HIV infection is dependent on a factor known as viral load (aka the amount of the virus in your system)

In the first 6-12 weeks of infection, the viral load spikes and is extremely contagious. This is known as acute infection and is when HIV is most dangerous.

After this, the virus settles down and the viral load drops back down - it then slowly increases over a period of time. This stage is latent infection. People can remain in the latent stage of infection for years.

Then, once the virus has taken over the body again and knocked your CD4 count down to below 200, that is considered AIDS. In this stage, HIV is not as contagious as it was in the acute infection stage, but is still contagious.

Now, if the person is on medication and has a viral load that is undetectable, they cannot pass HIV to a partner. The risk is zero.

That being said, HIV is an extremely difficult virus to catch..  To put the risk of transmission into perspective, **IF** you came into contact with someone who was positive, *and* they had a high viral load, the risk of contracting it varies by the type of act. 

When not using condoms - The riskiest scenario for infection, is receptive anal sex. 
- The relative risk for this is 1.9% 
- During the acute stage the risk increases sevenfold and goes to 13%. 
- **The risks for all other sexual acts fall dramatically below this.** For more stats you can check out the [relative risk table from Aidsmap.](https://www.aidsmap.com/about-hiv/estimated-hiv-risk-exposure)

It would probably help for the future to re-educate yourself and others on [HIV transmission](https://www.catie.ca/hiv-transmission) and the [likelihood of infection occurring](https://www.aidsmap.com/about-hiv/estimated-hiv-risk-exposure). Also, understanding [U=U](https://www.catie.ca/positive-side/uu) is an important step in destigmatizing HIV and preventing new infections. ### ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIV/comments/shnveo/hiv_vs_aids_transmission/

Stiff neck after three months means nothing!

I advise you to get tested, your life and health is always better than your work!

The bloke who fucked him before you who claims he is undetectable, if he is having bb sex he will not stay undetectable, and he could very well easily be detectable or transmissive.

Don't take the claims or rumours of strangers as an excuse to have bb sex and not use condoms. Get tested for HIV, and all other sexual diseases including hepatitis. ### Update: the bottom just told me that only one guy cummed inside him, and it was someone he knows is undetectable (and I've known the bottom for years, so I trust his word).

Man I am depressed, broken inside out, can’t focus on my studies or anything. After i get it removed what is the next step that i take? I have a very beautiful girlfriend and I haven’t had sex with her yet. Maybe i have it way earlier. I don’t want to lose her. How do i cope up with this mental pressure? Please help anyone…",10,2022-01-27 04:53:49-05:00,"Once it’s removed what are you worried about ? Not trying to be rude but genuinely curious? ### If it’s indeed a genital wart, they are caused by HPV. Removal of the wart, independently of the method, only eliminates the lesion, but does not clear the viral infection.

HPV is pretty common, estimates say that everyone in their life will get infected with HPV at some point. Young people are often the group with most exposure because of sexual activity. Talking with your doctor/derm is very helpful. 

If you haven’t gotten the Gardasil vaccine, you may want to get it. It will protect you from other strains of HPV, some of which are considered high risk (HPV-16,18 which can evolve into some types of cancer if untreated. These don’t tend to cause warts.)

In general, most people clear the infection. How long it takes can vary. There is no blood test that can help determine if the infection has been cleared by your body. My overall tip: get vaccinated, keep a healthy lifestyle (good diet, exercise, no drugs/smoking). With time, things should be good and everything will turn out okay.

If you engage in sexual activity, disclosing your status is important. Use protection at all times (vaginal, oral, anal), to keep your girlfriend safe. She most likely is vaccinated against HPV, but you should ask anyway.

I hope everything turns out okay, OP. It’s easier said than done, but keeping an optimistic view is important. I wish you all the best. ### Well hpv isn’t permanent. So just tell her you want to wait until marriage or something until you’re sure it’s kinda gone.  Hpv can cause cancer so make sure u get all ur tests ### Do you have it? ### Hey so the thing is i cannot visit the derm rn. I scheduled for next week. I used to smoke heavily cigarettes (not in packets as in 6-7 cigarettes a day)  and pot also used to vape. Now for the past two days i have tried cutting down my smoke habits. I havent smoked a whole cigarette in the past two days and i only smoke a bit pot just before sleeping/ after waking up. The thing is i cannot stop at all suddenly. It’s been a habit of mine. I cannot tell my girlfriend or my parents right now. I may tell my girlfriend later in the future when we have sex. But man, im devastated ### No I don’t , I have herpes and PPP which are stuck with me for life but I have GF ? And have sex ? So once your wart is removed you’ll be good won’t you ? I get right now you probably don’t like having it there but it can luckily be removed ### I understand. Facing situations like this is very hard. But there’s many ways to navigate them!

Smoking is linked to a decreased immune response, which can cause a symptomatic presentation (like your wart). HPV infections can be asymptomatic in most occasions, but smoking (tabaco particularly, I have no data on how cannabis affects the immune system and HPV) usually doesn’t help if you want to clear the infection, the same applies to bad diet habits or lack of exercise. A healthy lifestyle is encouraged because it helps to strengthen your immune system, which helps your body to fight the virus.

Quitting is hard (been there myself), but it’s very helpful. Doing it cold turkey is not for everyone, but other ways (like patches, gums) can open the way to at least quit cigarettes while still using nicotine. This is something that, of course, you have to speak with a doctor or a counselor and you have to determine if you are ready to quit so they may guide you towards the best steps to follow so you can achieve it. But it’s a very personal journey.

As for discretion, that’s more than alright. You should only disclose the situation if you feel safe and ready to do so. As for your girlfriend, it would be important if sex comes up, as she could be at risk of contracting it. But that’s something that you’ll work through in due time.

Know that you are not alone, and that you’ll be okay. For now, go to your appointment. Get checked (and indeed confirm that it’s a wart), get treated and talk with your doctor about the Gardasil vaccine. They might also recommend other treatments/lifestyle changes that can help you get back on track. ### Thanks man. I will get to you after my appointment ### ",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIV/comments/sduv0c/losing_interest_in_life_i_am_desperate_please/

I am in a super dark place. My girlfriend and I split up with plans to get back together. As she is long distance at the moment.

I was super upset and drunk one night and visited a prostitute. The condom broke and I have been worried since. I missed the PEP timing and now feeling sick. I have a test tomorrow...

What do I do? My life is over if I get it I cannot literally go on...

I am not being dramatic I cannot do it.


Help please


Edit: please I am crying and really don't know what to do. I know I can't do anything until I get tested but what happens if I am positive. How do I go on? How do I tell people?


Update: going to a HIV clinic to talk about next steps. Monday is when I will have the results for an RNA.

How can I tell someone? I don't really have anyone to trust or close to me.

Update 2: Went to a HIV center and was tested (the test that you normally take at 4 weeks) this was negative of course.

I don't feel any more chills, nausea, etc however under my arm is hurting which doesn't help.

I know I can't do anything until Monday until I get the RNA test, but I just feel so lost that I am supposed to just wait until I hear about my status.




UPDATE 3: I took an HIV RNA Test today 1/31/2022 - It was negative - what does this mean can it be a false negative? The person said it was 96% accurate. What do I do now I am still very worried I have it...

My question is, If I was sick from an exposure would this test be able to pick it up? How sure should I be I do not want to get my hopes up....



UPDATE 4: I took a second HIV RNA test. It was not detected.

I understand I have to wait until week 6 but it is really difficult to wait that long. Not sure if I should take another RNA at 21 days?

Please help",81,2022-01-26 13:27:02-05:00,"Listen dude,
I been HIV positive since 1997.
It's been a few years since 🤪
I never ever had symptoms. Calm yourself down. You don't have it !!!! That's it. You stressing over nothing. ### You had a low risk exposure for starters. Believe it or not, most sex workers do not have HIV. Symptoms would not start this soon, symptoms usually don’t start until 2-4 weeks after exposure and symptoms do not mean anything as most with symptoms test negative. Antibody tests are basically not going to tell you anything until the 6 week mark post exposure. You can get an RNA test which can give you a sooner conclusive result. 

Vaginal sex is a low risk exposure without a condom with someone positive you are around a 1 in 2000 risk, I assume you stopped as soon as the condom broke which makes your exposure mush less. 

I can understand your fear, but the odds are very much in your favor. I wouldn’t worry to much. ### Just take a deep breath. I went through the exact same thing and am still going through it except I didn’t use any protection. Even if she had it , there is still a slim chance you would have got it. When was the exposure ? ### I was in same situation as you( see post history). It will get better as time goes on trust me. Rna test at 14 days is very accurate from what I researched so maybe consider delaying till day 14. If you could wait few more days it would give you a lot of mental peace knowing that you are very likely negative. Then once you get that negative go for 4th gen test at anytime 45 days+ and that will conclusively rule out HIV. I am sure you will be fine. Condom breaking still means that she is seeing clients with condom. Its not like she is seeing clients to have unprotected sex.. Its highly unlikely that she has it and so extremely unlikely that you have it. Everything will be fine. Time is a great healer but those initial days are the hardest. ### Believe it or not sex workers test regularly because this is their living. I’ve read and seen videos on sex worker interviews. ###   
Ambiguity is a bitch and when we are talking about something that is marketed like HIV it can be devastating. 

It is very unlikely to get infected with only one encounter. Even with a prostitute in Amsterdam. Just get a full STD screening and it would solve a lot of problems.

And the worst-case scenario, if it was positive, don't worry. Just read about what happens when you get HIV in a progressed country like yours. You even can have children and unprotected sex without infecting others. This will be just a pill that you need to take daily. Anything might happen but HIV in a 1st world country is nothing more than a pill you should take regularly. ### Hi there,
I recently had unprotected sex with a sex worker and after 4 days I started having symptoms like tiredness, sore throats, headache, and a low grade fever.

I started worrying and had a fourth generation test after 7 days from exposure, then a PCR at 13 days, then another 4th gen at three weeks and four weeks and 6 weeks, and in 8 weeks (4th gen and another PCR) all returned negative, still I have sore throat’s and tiredness!

IDK what to say, your case is almost like me, today is the day 80 from the exposure and some symptoms still persist, I am going to take one more test next Thursday after 84 days ish.

You might not had HIV, with note that I had a full STD profile and all comes negative in the 60 days mark.

What others are saying here? ### Aye I do got a question if y'all don't care to answer ### Can hiv spread through clothes cause I have a roommate and accidentally grabbed his clothes thinking they was mine for work and the underwear were is used ones can hiv spread through unclean underwear I've been really worried I thought they were mine but they were his used ones ### U have all those symptoms? Get a hsv blood test too might not be hiv ### Bro ive been doing the same thing you did since i was 16 (im 31), 2 weeks ago being my newest encounter with this gorgeous brazilian 19-year ikd pawg, raw. no anal only vjj & oral. anyhow. i did start the truvada thing with the other meds, did get a quick shot for other stds (post prophylaxis). its not the first time ive been in your shoes and my pcp is sick and tired of my shit. chances are u probably got the rona instead. xD ### The problem is I am experiencing all the symptoms of acute hiv, naseua, insomnia, sweating chills... so I am pretty sure I have it... I am so lost ### Last Thursday ### And I have chills etc. Freaking out already figuring out how to say goodbye ### But the problem is that I have almost every symptom of the acute hiv infection... like chills, fever, sweats, muscle aches... ### Thank you. I do appreciate it.

How do I tell someone who we had hopes of getting back together? How do I explain a mistake like this? ### I am now pinpointing to reactivated EBV because of the high wording and anxiety that will lower the immune system efficiency!

Awaiting for the comments that may also reduce my worries.

Very bad feeling to wait for something bad, hope we both had not been infected by the exposure as the timelines are not matching the HIV infection. ### Hey thanks for taking the time.

I appreciate the words. I am still having diarrhea and some nausea. The sweats and chills are gone. They stopped yesterday.

All these symptoms began on day 3 and lasted for 3/4 days. 

I know I have to wait until Monday but I cannot believe that I don't have it if I have every symptom listed. It doesn't make sense if I'm negative. I really do understand I can't do anything but I am so lost right now. ### No; never ### no but, you might wanna get a pregnancy test or plan b Jason. ### Those are called anxiety symptoms not HIV symptoms ### Gotcha , definitely wayyyyy too early to test for it unless it’s an RNA test , even then you should get tested a couple months from now as that is the recommended window period. These first few weeks are gonna be rough because so much is going to go through your mind. However remember you are lower risk and also remember anxiety and stress cause so many symptoms , I know first hand. You’ll come out fine regardless of what happens. ### I had some night sweat, loss of apetite , bit of sore throat..Had the same experience as you but many good people on this subreddit reminded me that hiv is never diagnosed through symptoms and that is what got me through..That is why I chose to do many tests just for my anxiety..See if you are having symptoms then it means seroconversion happened so your test will always be positive after seroconversion. So I did tests every few days after symptoms which confirned with me what people on this subreddit were saying about symptoms not being due to hiv..That really calmed me..Then I realised that a lot of them were anxiety based...As the tests started coming out negative My anxiety reduced and apetite improved and all the symptoms disappeared...If you can afford it do engage a therapist..I used betterhelp which is an app and makes it easy yo get matched with a therapist.. ### Just the way you are telling this story here.

Nothing is different.

You have made a choice and it might have some consequences (Honestly, I am pretty sure there is no HIV, and by consequences I mean some events in your relationship). You have to get along with it. 

You seem to be sorry, if I were in her/ his shoes, I would definitely forgive you but hold you accountable for it and made you promise it will not happen again no matter what. I mean if there was a gun on your head and the only way out was to do this again, it is ok. Otherwise, NO.

Don't worry about it buddy. And please get a consultation from a doctor about your situation. ### As per my research, the symptoms typically will never start at three days after exposure!

You have me as a current case, till 60 days all negative!

I will convince you to hope for the best.

I also may have one more test tomorrow on the mark of 80 day’s.

I will keep you posted, let’s pray for each other’s. ### Alright thanks ### Thank you for the kind words. But I am experiencing flu like symptoms. Monday on day 10 I will get an RNA test because I can't wait longer... but what do I do because I know it is positive ### This is very comforting.

I have had chills, sweats, hotness, I can't stop pacing around my apartment, insomnia, nausea... as you said I know these won't tell me anything but I just have that feeling that I have it and I have to wait to Monday. I have no idea how I can make it through the weekend ### I just am so ashamed and if positive how can I begin to explain that to her?

I know I made the choice to do an act but I didn't choose to get HIV. Do I explain it is manageable? 

I understand I have to wait to Monday but understanding how I can explain it helps me. ### I will pray for you. Thank you ### This is too soon for symptoms to be appearing in relation to HIV. Also flu symptoms could be the flu , stress , Covid , an a number of other things. Believe me I already convinced myself I have HIV and have already started looking into seeing how much meds would be and what not, but it’s just not the way to think. I know our chances as heterosexual males are possible but are extremely low. I’m highly confident that you’ll be negative and you will simply take this as a learning lesson ### I had insomnia as well and had a bit of nausea due to eating less..Trust me on this its not hiv..What helped me through those few days until the test was distracting myself watching movies, going for a walk ..Its hard but try to stay off reddit or search in google..Maybe set few times a day when you will check reddit...Otherwise it becomes very anxiety inducing. ### Dude relax. There is no HIV with one encounter. You have to be very unlucky the get it from one vaginal sex. Particularly the way you had it.

If you are positive, believe me, that nothing is gonna end or change that much. You only have to take a pill every night. That's all. 

If she chose to be with you, then she has to get along with you and your decisions, correct or wrong.  And if she said fuck you and moved on from you, again it is not the end of the world. It is sad, I know. You have to grieve, I know. But there are other girls who would date you and love you.

&#x200B;

I am pretty sure there must be a doctor for these cases even on the weekend and public holidays. Go and consult with them.

Also, you can pay the prostitute to get tested right away. If she is not positive, then you're not as well.

&#x200B;

And by the way, you know it might be nothing. Right? ### I have given the blood this morning, I am now in my 12 week.

Will update you once I got the results!

Thanks, ### It came back non reactive!

Please be chill, looks like HIV symptoms will not start in there days! ### Thank I really do appreciate it. I just read online that symptoms appear in 3 days... and idk I know I have it ugh I'm sorry just so so nervous ### It's just that I had the encounter Friday morning. By Monday I was having every symptom, chills, headache, nausea, diarrhea, sweating alot. This lasted till Wednesday evening. Literally every symptom.

I know that this is unusual for how quick it occurred but it isn't out of the question. I just would rather plan for the worst, hope for the best.

I will find out Monday but I don't have high hopes for it being negative. ### And weight loss I lost like 5kg in 8 days, because I had no appetite and nausea ### Congratulations!

I am still worried but accepted it mostly if it is positive.

Monday I find out ### That would be of a rare occurrence. But pretty much everyone who has posted here is going through the same thing. We’ve convinced ourselves we have it and I can guarantee majority of people in this group did not end up having it. Just try to occupy yourself until you get tested and once that is done you can move on. I’m willing to bet money you’re negative ### Be cool please, I am confident you will be negative.

Please keep me posted. ### I really appreciate it. Any ideas or what I can do if I am positive? ### Hey hey,

I got the HIV RNA result, negative but I am worried I tested too early?? ### Since I have been doing my research in preparation for if I’m positive , we just need to have our doctors put us on a once a day prescription and then it’ll lower our virus so much that a test couldn’t see it nor could it be transmitted. Reading about it from people who have it, it’s not a big deal to them. Just a pill once a day. Totally doable , eventually your life will feel normal again ### Till now how many days from exposure?
Certainly NOT, the symptoms will only appear as a reaction to high viral load and so:
1- If the symptoms cleared, then there must be a measurable antibodies that reduced the viral load.
2- symptoms still there due to a high viral load.

In both cases you are clear, especially the symptoms came was so early and this is normally not applicable to HIV infection graphs!

Just say congratulations to yourself and thanks god that it came well. ### What about a relationship with someone who is HIV -? ### 10 and a half days from exposure.

I am just worried because im still feeling not 100%.

My question really is, if I was sick with HIV and had symptoms would the HIV RNA test be able to pick it up? Is that how it works? ### That is going to be different but there are dating sites for people who are hiv positive and there are plenty of women who are educated in the subject and doesn’t bother them as long as you’re undetectable. Not saying it’s gonna be as easy if you are negative but there’s definitely plenty of options still ### Certainly yes, the HIV standard RNA device like GeneXpert will detect as low as 50 copies per ml, the altar sensitive device will detect even lower like 20 copies per ml.

If your symptoms is due to HIV infection, this means your viral load is so high and guaranteed will be detected by the PCR test.

Even the infected people who is not experiencing any symptoms will be detected by PCR only, and the aim for them is to make it undetectable.

Be sure, your are cleared from HIV, congratulations! ### Ah I still can't shake it, with symptoms still and a really anxiety inducing week.

I appreciate your thoughts.

The test I got was the ""GeneXpert"" and it states negative.

I am just so worried that it provided a false negative... ### It must stated NOT DETECTED, not NEGATIVE.

This means there is NO HIV RNA in your blood!

Please be chill, or you will be like me, I have done TWO bloody PCR tests, one in 13 days, and another one in 60 days.

I have done maybe 7 4th gen in between, last one was on Saturday which is my 80th day from exposure, and still having symptoms!

You tell me, what you will do in this case? 

Will you keep throwing it on HIV?

This is not right, the studies said that the PCR will detect it for sure, and then someone affected will be seroconverted just based on this immune response, and the maximum will be 90 days.

So, if there is no HIV RNA, and you have symptoms, then what you will be seroconverted to?

There is no HIV virus that your body is dealing with, which means you are waiting for something does not even exist as long as you do not have another exposure, so you are waiting for nothing.

Your symptoms is due to something else only.

Be cool, and shake it please. ### You are right it says undetected.

I am trying to just very difficult. I am thinking of getting another HIV RNA test in 4 days, so it will be 14 days out.

I know it's expensive but I can't stop and I'd rather have a conclusive result.

Just very scared I apologise just scared. ### I advised you not to worry more than usual, I swear I am like you, but the truth is I am trying to get a positive report by force!

This is only what I am trying to to for the past 82 days.

I am still planning to get one more test at 90 days, but do you think it will change? ### I booked a test for Friday, another HIV RNA test. If this is negative can that mean I am conclusively negative from HIV? or is there still a chance the virus has not infected me yet?

The earliest they said was 99% was at 6 weeks but I really can't wait that long. ### I moved it till Thursday I am still freaking out.

I keep reading that 10 days is not enough time for the HIV RNA to be sufficiently accurate.

I will test on the 13th day... ### It will be negative!

I guarantee this, since you have symptoms if it’s related to HIV then no chance it does not appear in the test!

You waited for 10 just to make it more than enough, you will be like me, just keep repeating the tests and all will come back negative. ### I really appreciate you responding it does help.

But I am worried the test did not pick up as it only goes to 50/ML...

I understand the symptoms could not be part of it I am just so scared I still have it. ### You do NOT have it, make sure that the PCR is very very very sensitive and it amplifies even a fraction of the RNA - if present.

Since it’s NOT detected, this means your symptoms isn’t related to HIV at all.

I also had the same idea as yours, the virus will keep replicating until the body immune system generates antibodies against it.

So, since no RNA then nothing will appear.

You will see very soon the other test will also be NOT DETECTED.

Make one test (4th gen) in the mark of 45 days to rule out any odds. ### I do understand but my concern is that the viral load is too small to detect at 10 days, too few copies currently.

I saw that 10 days is actually not that accurate that's why my concern. 

I understand it would be positive if it was the cause of my symptoms but I am more stressed that the RNA is low because it is too close to the infection day and did not have enough time to reach detectable levels.. ### See, scientifically your theory isn’t correct at all.

The virus nature is to replicate and at this stage it must be the highest point with millions of copies per ml.

The symptoms are coming only because of hight viral only.

The infected individuals who does NOT experience symptoms are detectable if they are not on therapy.

So, how about someone who experiencing symptoms, it must be detectable for sure.

The doctors use the PCR to rule out that the symptoms isn’t cases by the HIV.

since you have symptoms, then viral load MUST be detectable.

You are just clear from HIV, believe me. ### I totally understand that!

I am saying that if the symptoms are NOT related but I still have it. 

This could mean that the virus cannot be detected at 10 days since the viral load is below the measuring capability of the machine.

That's why I am worried. I understand that if it was the cause of the symptoms then it would show. However, I am very worried that I have not had the symptoms of the virus yet and therefore it cannot be detected.

I apologise for texting so much I just am still so anxious... ### Does that make sense? ### I am going tomorrow morning. I am worried I tested too early.


I am now having a sore throat which is the first sign.

I am so scared I can't deal with it ### Hey Any_Amoeba_860,

The test came back not detected. For an HIV RNA PCR test. The GeneXpert one.

I want to thank you for your comments. Do you suggest I get another PCR at 21 days? To rule it out and peace of mind, because it is still lingering in the back of my head. They say to test at 6 weeks to be sure but it is so difficult for me to wait that long. ### Congratulations once again, you are HIV negative!

No chance of being positive at all.

As per the guidelines, you need to wait for 6 weeks and test with 4 gen just to rule out any odds like HIV-2.

If you can’t wait this long, to reduce the anxiety do a fourth gen test in 28 days from exposure.

This is a very rare type of HIV and mostly available in west Africa, since your exposure isn’t related to Africa the chance is very very low to get it.

Please act normal and you will be just fine. ### Just out of curiosity because it seems like you have done alot of research.

I noticed that when they do the PCR they only take a small amount of blood... is this normal??? ### Yes, the PCR now is an automated process, the device will not work if the blood they supply isn’t enough for the testing cartridge.

The PCR test is make based on the blood plasma which is so accurate in detecting any fractions of viral RNA.

the PCR can even detect the RNA in a dried blood - if present - see how sensitive is this test.

It is not an approved test to diagnose the HIV for many reasons and one of them is that this test may give a false positive rather than false negative.

When you get negative from GeneXpert, this means you are clear and no sings of HIV genital material in your blood.

Chill, you are NOT infected, and your symptoms is not related to HIV.

I have also done more than what you have done and there are a millions of people do, the published data about HIV was studied very well and if there is a chance it will be for sure documented.

UK and US guidelines was very very clear, it states a fourth gen test done after 6 weeks does not need to be confirmed.

And the PCR will for sure deny the symptoms caused by HIV.

In contrast, another test 4th gen in 45 days from the exposure day will give the final, and it’s very likely you are negative. ### The test at 21 days (PCR RNA) would help to conclude I do not have it correct? ### This test already concluded you do no not have it, if you want to do another test by 21 days better to do combo test instead of PCR, it’s not gonna changed. ### The reason I ask is because if the viral load is higher by then it will be more accurate no?

The testing center says I should not do any another test until 6 weeks... I just have no idea how to wait that long to make sure I don't have it.

That's why I was thinking getting the RNA one more time at 21 days so if I had it then the viral load would be high.

Is there any possibility that I am still too early for testing with the RNA PCR test? The back of my head is telling me that it is too early and my body still not get sick yet from it...

I really really appreciate your answers ### I don’t know what to answer you really.

You said you had symptoms, so your body is sick!

I’d your body is sick and recognized the virus, the PCR also can detect it!

Now, you either believe that your are sick because of something else like paranoia, or some other infection.

Or you had in worst case scenario - which is so unlikely - an HIV-2.

HIV-2 will only appear in 4th generation sometime around 28 days.

So, making another PCR by 21 days will not change the game and you are just making tests for wasting money.

In my personal opinion, you are HIV free, just wait for 28 days and make one combo. ### I am just worried that the virus has not yet infected me yet but I still have it...

I understand that the symptoms are not it but I am worried that maybe I haven't gotten sick yet and just very very nervous I haven't felt anything yet.

Just worried that the PCR didn't pick it up because I have not been sick from it yet. ### This theory is not correct at all!

The virus when in enters the body, the purpose for it is to get replicated and infecting the blood cells.

The aim and the great thing about the PCR is looking for the general material (RNA) in the blood regardless you are sick or not.

The RNA can normally be found in the blood plasma before the seroconversion (regardless with or without symptoms).

The seroconversion period is only counted based on positive RNA and negative antibodies.

Since the RNA isn’t detected now, then you either have not to worry about your symptoms as HIV is not the reason, or you make another serology test (4th gen) test in about 6 weeks to close this chapter. ### Hi man,

Tell me how are you now?

Are you now feeling better? ### Hey,

Well I still have it in the back of my mind.

On Monday I take a blood test as it will be week 5 but I have to wait till week 6.

Still very worried as I had some other symptoms. I spoke with an infectious disease doctor and he said the chances were so low but idk still very hard to not think I don't have it.


Just praying until I found out ### Hey, so just got the results back for a HIV 1, 2 Antibody p24 ag. Combo test and it is negative.

I took the test at 31 days

They said that we cannot rule it out until I test again at 6 weeks but it does help a bit!

What do you thin ### Hi,

YOU ARE A 100% NEGATIVE!

be chill please, I have tested at 90 days and negative but still symptoms, and I found people says it can’t be ruled before testing at 6 months!

You will be well bro l, don’t worry. ### Hey! Tested at 6 weeks (really 45 days)

And all negative, thanks for all the help been a crazy time and you helped a bunch ### Contacts, it was guaranteed!

Hope you will be well, this studies came after 40 ish years of analysis. It would be 99 percentile correct.

sbbn0p,"Unsafe encounter | Waited 5 years to get tested | Ruined my life with the stress & scare of HIV | Lived 5 years thinking I'm Positive | Got a Negative Result but Crazy Joint Pain + Cracking whenever I move joints (would appreciate if anyone could help figure out what is it) Hi everyone! So I'm 26 today and when I was 21 (back in 2016) I had an unsafe sexual encounter with a massage therapist. It was also my first time and I was stupid who didnt realise you don't do it without protection (unfortunately, sex ed isn't really a thing in this part of the world) but after 15-20 seconds I realised this and asked her to stop. Went into crazy depression mode from right away and its the same till today. 

Had a 3 year long relationship, without even getting tested told my gf of what I did. It was guilt and fear that I couldn't stop myself, finall lost her after 1 year when she cheated on me and later married that guy. It was the most beautiful thing I had and lost it.

Changed my career paths. Became an entrepreneur. Did well but could never really act like a youngster as I was always scared I have HIV.

Gained almost 30-35 kg's in these 5 years. Didnt go to gym thinking I've HIV and I possibly don't have the strength.

I've basically ruined my life over this fear. No relationships. Not fully focussed on work. Bad health. Always depressed. Always angry. Being bad to family members. 

I recently got the courage to get tested and it all came negative. But I had another unsafe encounter on the night of 31st Jan 2021 so now waiting for the window period to get final tests done and I hope its a negative so I can move on with my life.

Now one major issue has been joint pain. My anxiety has been crazy. I dont think Ive slept peacefully in last 5 years, that should explain the situation. The moment I got a negative HIV result 10 days back, my pain in knees kinda disappeared but the girl I had an unsafe encounter with on 31st blocked me when I asked her to share her reports (I asked her to get tested and she said she did) so post that the pain came back again.

Now I'm 26. My weight is about 90 kgs and height is 165 cm. Obese. BMI 32 something. No pain before this HIV scare but it has been conistent since that first unsafe encounter.

I got xrays done 2 years back but when the doctors said it could be or is arthritis, I stopped visiting them because I thought they might ask me to get tested for HIV. I also feel that they read the xrays incorrectly.

I'm sharing xray images below, could anyone please tell me if its arthritis or not? My joints have a cracking sound whenever I move them (pain and popping is now happening on ankle, shoulder, elbow and hands/fingers as well apart from knees).

I really want to get my shit together now. I've lost a lot of time and the love of my life. I need to get back normal. Please help if you know anything about it. Thanks 🙏🏻",5,2022-01-23 22:05:23-05:00,"yr hiv hysteria is insane.  u need psychiatric help.  i mean that seriously.  yr more likely to get yr shit together if u get professional help to get over this. ### [deleted] ### Sounds like anxiety ### Man not sure what part of the world you’re in but people have unprotected sex all the time with people they barely or don’t know.. some people every week when partying.

s6i6xq,"Early HIV infection and loss of immunity HI all, 

I know that having an undetectable viral load is equal to no damage to our immune system . 

However , does our immune system get affected when we first get HIV and the viral load is too high ?
 
I feel that sometimes ,we , people with HIV are really pampered by the healthcare system  ( which I find great) but it also makes me wonder about the reason why we get all that extra care   when we have   undetectable viral loads and good CD4 (cancer check ups , etc) . Why do we have loads of comorbidities ? Is this only down to our medication or is it that our immune  system is not as good as it used to be before getting HIV ? Is there anything else that got affected when we got HIV and isn't recoverable in despite of our ARV therapy?

Also , I remember  having to get some boosters for hep b immunity  ( I don't know if the immunity  got lost due to the early hiv infection or it was just a normal thing that happens to everyone regardless of their status) 


Please bear in mind that some of this questions might sound so stupid and they might have  easy answers... but I'm sure that loads of people will have similar questions  to mine. 

Thanks in advance",2,2022-01-17 18:24:09-05:00,"for next time, r/hivaids is a better place to ask questions like this.  and a better sub in general in general for people who are poz.  this sub is mostly 'omg i touched a hooker's bra do i have aids?' bullshit.

>However , does our immune system get affected when we first get HIV and the viral load is too high ?

ofc acute hiv affects the immune system, but the negative effects aren't permanent.  cd4 takes a big dip during acute hiv, but it rebounds even without medicine once the immune response kicks in.  unless people start medicine **very** late in infection, there's usually no permanent damage to immune function.

>I feel that sometimes ,we , people with HIV are really pampered by the healthcare system ( which I find great) but it also makes me wonder about the reason why we get all that extra care when we have undetectable viral loads and good CD4 (cancer check ups , etc)

money and politics.  there's funding for hiv that doesn't exist for any other disease.  there's no equivalent to ryan white funding for any other illness.  the funding structure, lobbying/advocacy orgs, and treatment institutions for hiv all came into being decades ago, when hiv was a **very** different disease.  when the first effective regimens came out in the 90s, it took a lot doctors time to manage the brutal side effects.  and so there was a lot of funding to make it possible.  esp bcuz before obamacare people with hiv were nearly 'uninsurable' on the private market.  but as treatment got easier and easier, and as insurance became easier to get, the funding didn't go down.  it actually went **up.**  bcuz there's now a humungous 'hiv industrial complex' with a lot of power to make sure that funding keeps flowing.  it has nothing to do with the current **merits** of giving pwhiv special privileges that people with other diseases don't have.  it's all about our political power and the power of our lobbying groups.  that's the plus side to hiv stigma.  if hiv were 'just like any other treatable disease', that shit wouldn't exist.

>Why do we have loads of comorbidities ?

most people with hiv don't have 'loads of comorbities'.  we get **some** comorbidities at higher rates than the general population.  the biggest reason is bcuz people with hiv **aren't like the rest of the population.**  on average, we are poorer, blacker, more lgbtq, more likely to drink, smoke, use drugs, engage in more risky behaviors, more likely to be homeless or food insecure, more likely to have lifestyles associated with other diseases, more likely to have psychological problems.

it's almost impossible to find a good comparison group that controls for all the factors that put pwhiv at higher risk of many diseases.

the second reason is that 'people with hiv' includes **a large number of people who had unmanaged hiv for years and years before beginning treatment.**  unmanaged hiv causes chronic inflammation and chronic inflammation is a big risk factor for many diseases.  also, 'people with hiv' includes those of us who've had hiv for 30 or 40 years and were on older generations of medicines that are no longer used.  many of those medicines caused permanent damage to some of us.  so 'people with hiv' are a varied group.

hiv medications increase the risk of some diseases, but with modern medicines, it's not that big of a factor.

immunodeficiency is a factor if u consider **everyone** with hiv.  bcuz there's a percentage of people with hiv who did not get on effective medication until hiv had totally decimated their immune system.  to the point that it couldn't always be fully repaired.  but if u only at people who **started medicine early**, immunodeficiency wouldn't be a factor.

the stats on comorbidities are **averages.**  someone who starts biktarvy during acute infection in 2021 isn't gonna be at the same risk of medication- and immunodeficiency- related comorbidities as someone who was infected in 1984, spent years on toxic medicines like ddi and ddc and d4t, didn't become undetectable until the virus was active for 15 years.

>is it that our immune system is not as good as it used to be before getting HIV ?

depends when the person starts medicine and how damaged their immune system is at that point.  also depends on their age at infection.  people infected at birth who aren't immediately medicated can have perma damage that people infected as grownups don't have.  someone who doesn't start medicine until their cd4 is close to zero might have permanent damage that won't be fully reversed.  but someone who starts medicine early after infection won't have any permanent damage to their immune system.

>Is there anything else that got affected when we got HIV and isn't recoverable in despite of our ARV therapy?

not if medicine is started early.

>Also , I remember having to get some boosters for hep b immunity ( I don't know if the immunity got lost due to the early hiv infection or it was just a normal thing that happens to everyone regardless of their status)

everyone needs multiple shots of the hep b vax.  it's 2, 3, or 4 shots depending on diff things like age and type of vaccine.  without knowing your full immunization history, nobody can tell you anything.  hep b titers [go down in everybody](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23408522/) after primary vaccination.   we have no deets at all about your immunization history, your titers of hb surface ab, or anything else.  or your hiv history.  but there's no reason to think it's related. ### Waoo this has been a really elaborated answer.

To put the risk of transmission into perspective, **IF** you came into contact with someone who was positive, *and* they had a high viral load, the risk of contracting it varies by the type of act. 

We know that [Condoms are highly effective at preventing HIV infection.](https://www.catie.ca/condoms-for-the-prevention-of-hiv-transmission) When not using condoms - The riskiest scenario for infection, is receptive anal sex. The relative risk for this is 1.9% - and if the person was newly infected (first 6-12 weeks), which is when they are most infectious, the risk increases sevenfold and goes to 13%. 

**The risks for all other sexual acts fall dramatically below this.** For more stats you can check out this [relative risk table.](https://www.aidsmap.com/about-hiv/estimated-hiv-risk-exposure)

It’s *theoretically* possible to get HIV from Oral, but there have never been any official documented cases. It’s also theoretically possible to travel through time or teleport.

It would probably help for the future to re-educate yourself and others on [HIV transmission](https://www.catie.ca/hiv-transmission) and the [likelihood of infection occurring](https://www.aidsmap.com/about-hiv/estimated-hiv-risk-exposure).

Have you stopped to consider the unique factors that contribute to the prevalence of HIV in Africa? In addition to the factors [outlined here](https://www.sos-usa.org/about-us/where-we-work/africa/aids-in-africa), let’s also take into account the chances of vertical transmission ([approximately 1000 infected infants are born every day](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9416374/)) and its [causes](https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/featurestories/2020/february/20200211_babies-becoming-infected-with-hiv-in-africa) in Africa.

Enlighten me… If it’s so highly infectious, why are the numbers we see in Africa not comparable in the rest of the world? ### Because in Africa there's not a good knowledge of the people about the STDS and protection, plus most of their presidents avoid the HIV thing.

early after transmission, antibody levels can be low.  w blot takes longer to turn positive than  hiv ab. ### WB is used to confirm HIV reactivity. If the WB is nonreactive, you don't have HIV at all. Besides, the weak pos suggested that there are antibodies in your blood that has the same sequence with the HIV antibodies. It might be other disease I guess. Beyond all that, it's better to consult your doctor. ### A few scenarios could be true :

\- either (most likely) a false pos

\- patient is in a portion of the window period that makes the tests taken not sensitive enough. p24 tests are not as sensitive as an official ran/dna test.

\- depending on your area west Africa, India, Spain and France the patient might have hiv-2. Fun fact I actually had a false positive for hiv-2 but my confirmation (genius ) was negative. unfortunately some weternblots don't check for hiv-2 cause it's so rare.

If I was you, I'd start pep Isentress Truvada mix works for both hiv-1 and hiv -2 I believe and you can have the patient tested for hiv-1 and hiv-2 rna dna if you don't want to continue pep. ### Hey ... if western blot results is negative then YOU DONT HAVE HIV. Relax. Covid and HIV antibodies has cross reactivity issues. Covid and hiv spike proteins have similarities that the medical field cant seperate yet. Please google hiv and covid cross reactivity and inform your doctor that cross reactivity between the two virus in new the medical field. ### It was 12 days between tests. If the WB was negative both times does that mean the patient it likely HIV negative? 
Unsure if they had any recent exposure. And these tests were taken 10 months ago (only had the Needlestick injury last week) ### These are the patients results from 10 months ago. Not mine. I’ll obviously get tested but I have to wait the certain amount of time. Just trying to get some clarity in the meantime so I don’t go bonkers. ### I’m from Australia. It’s it somewhat safe to assume that because both WB tests were negative that it’s more likely a false positive results or that something else it triggering a weak+ in the ag/ab test? ### tests from 10 months ago are not valid for needle stick risk factors. you need to tell your employer to test them now basically or just take pep. better safe than sorry. pep has bad side effects for 5 days and then become completely normal.

If you’re sexually active (you are) you should get tested regularly anyway. 

Short answer: you’re probably not HIV+ since you practiced safe sex (and previously tested negative), but get tested anyway (you should ALWAYS test before switching partners anyway). ### First letter of her name please curiosity kills ### Yes I was just trying to see if it was high risk or high chance she brought in the condom discreetly in her mouth and put it on me then gave me oral with condom and we had sex with condom but sex was max 4 minutes long so not that long then I told her to stop so we can do less risky activity such as handjob. I removed my condom and checked it later on for leaks and I did water and air test and I did not see any leaks in the condom from my test so I hope I was safe  from this 1 time exposure and before this I was not having sex and this was with sex worker also why I’m more worried ### I’m not really sure why that matters ### If it were the case that the SW was HIV+ and had it in her mouth, it is very unlikely you’d get HIV from her saliva. As said above, use condoms and get tested. ### Just asked a question don’t have to answer it ### I will test with hiv PCR test at 14 days they say they are 95 percent accurate and very strong accurate test at 2 weeks post exposure only issue is since they are very accurate early they are seriously expensive smh so I will pay the money at 14 days then take a 4th gen agian at 28 days then maybe agin at 3 months but I talked to a specialist before that noted that almost no 4th gen hiv test at 28 days ever came back positive later so I know people say 3 months but with the technology we have now if you have to funds there is no reason for people to suffer for 3 months mentally ### ",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIV/comments/s3zwi9/had_sex_with_a_sex_worker_today_its_bothering_me/

They called me today and said they test was reactive and it had to be taken again. So I asked the doctor what was the problem and I could sense he was hiding something.

if it's been 3 months and u already had a negative hiv test, **it was just stupid for u to take a pcr.  u are wasting expensive tests for no reason.  there's a reason they don't use pcr as a general hiv screen.  too many false pos and false neg results.**

yr doctor isn't hiding anything.  u did a test that wasn't recommended and now u have to live with anxiety that **u wouldn't have if u just accepted yr 3 month negative hiv test and moved on like u should've.** ### If you tested negative with a 4ty gen after 12 weeks then you don’t have hiv. 

It’s physiologically impossible for either antigen or antibodies to not be detected at that point based on all humans producing antibodies along with the test tracking antigen which is a particle of the virus itself. 

So seeing as neither was detected by your test, then you are indeed negative. Move on. ### [deleted] ### I had rubber then when I removed it I washed it with my hands. ### The pcr test came back positive bro but I tested again in another clinic 4th generation test and it came back negative ps= am on my 6th month ### then how could you have contracted it? ### Idk bro and I tested negative 4th generation after 3 months ### im sure youre alright. ### I hope so bro but how could it come back reactive if I don’t have it😭 ### may it was a faulty test ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIV/comments/s3w8yr/freaking_out_any_help_would_be_appreciated/
s3uat3,"can anyone help put my mind at ease? Hey guys I recently hooked up with this guys. Ive hooked up with him several times in the past and nothing has ever come of us. We were going back and firth making out a lot and I basically gave him blowjobs the whole time, all oral sex. I know you guys keep saying there is virtually no chance of getting it by giving blowjobs, but i did swallow some of his semen.

This was on Saturday night, about 2 and a half to 3 days after, I started feeling sick. I basically had chills, sore throat, muscle aches, I could barely move and it was terrible. At really only lasted for a day because now I feel pretty great but the sore throat is still lingering with a very phlegmy cough. 

I do plan on getting tested, but i would really like to know your opinions on whether or not i could have gotten it from swallowing his semen after a blowjob. Also I feel like the timeline on my symptoms is really quick right? I got sick and almost completely better before 1 week has gone by since the hookup.",2,2022-01-14 09:58:15-05:00,"2 to 3 days is a really short time period to have symptoms. The majority of people start having symptoms 2 to 4 weeks after infection.

And unless you had some kind of open wound in your mouth or throat it's highly unlikely that you would've been infected even if you knew this partner was positive

Get tested but in the mean time try not to assume the worst. That doesn't help anything. ### Sore throats after blow jobs are not uncommon. You might even get an infection! Genitals harbor a lot of bacteria, so it’s not rare that you might get sick after some intense oral sex. 

Like Mathias said, it’s highly unlikely that your symptoms are due to HIV. The incubation period for the virus ranges between 2-4 weeks after exposure (not 3-4 days), maybe more.

s3mvrp,"Had a Cut and 2 hours later I was with a Sl... Excuse my rhyme but I thought it might increase my chances of getting a reply from most people. 

So basically I was on Holiday, had a fall and bust my hand in few spots. I cleaned the wounds, sanitized them  and covered them with plasters. I left a date straight after that. Date went really well and fast track 2 hours later we were having sex. I kept on telling myself not to finger her with my wounded hand but that went out of the window and started fingering her with one finger before I came to my senses a few minutes later. After getting home I realized that there was a small wound on the finger that I used that I didn't pick up when I was patching up because it was so small. However there was a tiny spot of dried blood on the area which means it was an open wound and could be a source of Vaginally fuilds to enter my system. But it was dried so what is the risk?

It also doesn't help that I heard that the girl in question has been engaging in reckless sex and the last time she got tested was in 2019. She is hesitant to get test now and I can't exactly put a gun to her head. 

I spiral into a slow state on panic thinking the worst. Fastrack 28 hours later I was on PEP. But after reading the side effects on that huge paper, my refuge became a source of further worry. The two main things that are troubling me are the potential damage to kidneys and the reduction  of bone mass by 12 percent. The bone thing is scaring me to pieces because I already have very weak bones and I pick up injuries very easily but I haven't been diagnosed with anything. Now after PEP I don't want further complications. My kidneys aren't that great either. 

So I'm left doing a Risk/Value analysis with my life. Take the PEP and risk having further weak bones and pick up more injuries and have a deteriorated kidneys or take my chance with one of the most notorious diseases around.

If anything can provide my foresight on this trade of I will tremendously appreciate it.",7,2022-01-14 02:53:47-05:00,"Dried blood is not an open wound - it’s a scab.

Getting HIV from a female is extremely low risk - below 1% for unprotected sex - assuming she had the virus and is not in treatment. ### I just had sex with sex worker and I’m freaking out too even though she put a condom on me and I checked it for leaks I’m still worried but I won’t take pep the damage to the kidneys is too risky and my kidneys aren’t great ### Pep to me is not worth the risk permanent kidney damage vs 1-1000 chance of getting hiv ### That’s below 1 percent of a condom was not used correct? And even lower than that if a condom was used? ### [deleted] ### How long did you bust your hand before you fingered her ? Was it a few days or hours? I have the same kinda thing but my hand injury happened 3 weeks prior so I hope it healed properly in time I still have a really small scab on top of new pink skin that healed over the old skin so 21 days of healing before I fingered the sex worker I’m also worried about that until I just read a forum that said there has never in the history of hiv been a transmission via fingering and that it is simply theoretical so with that being said I’m pretty sure u WOULDNT be the first ever man millions and billions of people on this planet over 40 plus years have done worse and NO recorded cases of hiv via fingering I know we are afraid and worried and it’s ok to be but I believe we should be real with ourselves when faced with the facts also not 1 case ever of hiv from fingering. And when having sex u wore a condom right? ### [deleted] ### My case my kidneys are on the edge so 28 days of that medication would ruin me so I have to take my chance that the condom did its job how long was your sexual exposure? Mine was max 4 minutes and then she gave me a handjob to finish me and that when I fingered her but I think my wound is pretty well healed at 2 weeks so I’m not to worried about that but I’m very worried about the protective sex for some reason I don’t know why.

To put the risk of transmission into perspective, IF you came into contact with someone who was positive, *and* they had a high viral load, the risk of contracting it varies by the type of act. 

The riskiest scenario for infection, is receptive anal sex. The relative risk for this is 1.9% - and if the person was newly infected (first 6-12 weeks), which is when they are most infectious, the risk goes to 13%. 

[The risks for all other sexual acts fall dramatically below this.](https://www.aidsmap.com/about-hiv/estimated-hiv-risk-exposure)

It’s *theoretically* possible to get HIV from Oral, but has never officially happened. It’s also theoretically possible to travel through time or teleport. 

- [There is little to no risk of getting or transmitting HIV from oral sex.](https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/hiv-prevention/reducing-sexual-risk/preventing-sexual-transmission-of-hiv)

- [It’s possible to contract sexually transmitted infections (STIs) from oral sex — or using your mouth, lips, and tongue to stimulate your partner’s genitals or anus. But it doesn’t appear to be a common way to contract HIV.](https://www.healthline.com/health/oral-sex-hiv#risks)

- [There is almost no chance of getting HIV from giving someone fellatio (a blow job) when the person does not ejaculate (cum), or from giving cunnilingus (eating someone out).](https://www.catie.ca/en/oral-sex) (this link also has a nifty table that teaches you all about STI risks and oral sex)

HIV cannot survive outside the body and needs an entry into a new host. It should also be noted that there needs to be a large enough amount of the virus (viral load) to infect a new host if it is able to enter the body.

It would probably help for the future to re-educate yourself and others on [HIV transmission](https://www.catie.ca/en/prevention/transmission) and the [likelihood of infection occurring](https://www.aidsmap.com/about-hiv/estimated-hiv-risk-exposure). Also, looking up U=U is an interesting concept. ### How are you? ### Hi all, my test came back negative, my doctor want me on prep ### So according to OP he is safe.

No pep is allowed in uae for expats. No hiv test for expat as someone found positive will be deported immediately as every two years medical are done for resident expat for hiv.

1.	Regarding symptoms, Still now more than 34 days I am getting daily chills/shiver in my legs and back of shoulder on and off for 30 min in day or night. My body and feets feel like inflammatory response for few hours, then subside for few hours and get normal.  One day I am perfect energetic and other day again feeling like minor flu type in body with malaise, but without fever. Some day I get night sweat and some day I m normal no night sweats, but no fever, but only feverish feel in 34 days, except the first day. Does ARs symptoms are continue or on and off. Why I get night sweats without fever. How long the ars fever last. Does the fever goes on and off. What is the reason of my chills daily on and off. What about body pain on and off. 
2.	I read many seroconversion stories mostly getting high fever, sore throat, rash, swollen lhymp nodes. Does the chills and mild flu type symptoms on and off can be ars or something else. What the severity of fever and duration. What about the malaise or body ache severity and duration. 
3.	Most of the time I am low temperature 36 only. The maximum temperature goes 36.4 only. Morning time mostly my temperature is low, below 35.9 Does hiv ars causes low temperature.
4.	I had read that,  if art treatment started during seroconversion is better as the virus doesn’t permanently damage the immune system. If anyone gets positive and start medicine after 5 or 6 months of infection, is it ok. Whats your opinion. 
5.	What about the seroconversion illness, mostly doctors saying ars symptoms last 1 to 2 weeks, but my minor flu like symptoms is going on and off since 34 days. How the patient are treated for the ars symptoms without art medicines.  Today I visited the GP, he did the cbc, urine, esr, crp blood sugar etc, nothing came. He just gave painkillers.
6.	Sometimes I have nerve vibration in the morning affecting all joint and head making me feel weak like fatigue, what is that. I have mitral valve prolapse before I use to get like that, but since I start taking my hypertension medicine it stopped.
7.	If anyone has kidney cyst stage 2, does hiv virus can make problem for the cyst if the treatment start in acute phase like 3 to 6 months.

rvxjwc,"M[U18] So on November 1st, I had vaginal sex with a female (I don't know her status) and the condom broke, I noticed it when I finished, and cleaned it with water straight away, also it was my first time having sex.

I couldn't go to the Hospital because I'm not 18 yet and I couldn't tell it to my parents because I didn't have enough courage and didn't want to make them worry.

In less than a week after this happend I noticed some changes in my body, like pain while urinating, white tongue, swollen lymph nodes, little redness on the glans.

I ignored those symptoms, I thought they would go away on their own.

After 45 days (6 weeks) I had a mild fever  (98.6f or 37.0c to 99.32f or 37.4c) and sore throat, other symptoms remained..(fever lasted for 7-10 days)

Because of this I got really anxious and decided to tell my parents about it.

I went to the Hospital and got checked for HIV and syphilis after 52 days (7 weeks). They took blood from my vein.

And also got tested for other stds with swab after 53 days.

Every test answer came back as negative.

Doc told me that I only had some kind of Fungal infection (Candida maybe, idk exact name).

And now after 2 months I got fever, sore throat, pain while swallowing.

My questions are:
1) what kind of HIV tests are done with blood drawn from vein and are they correct after 7 weeks of possible exposure.

2) Is it possible for HIV to progress to AIDS after this short period of time? if a person has a weak immune system?

Thanks ya'll in advance.",4,2022-01-04 10:53:50-05:00,"I had a similar situation with you but I didn’t have any symptoms. I took a test at 51,52 days and it was negative. It was a 4th gen test and it supposed to be conclusive anytime after 45 days. Many people in the forum say “tests overrule symptoms” and that really has helped me calm down. So you should calm yourself too. I hope your symptoms go away soon and I wish you to recover soon. ### The syphilis and HIV tests I get are done using my blood. I'd say they're close to 100% accurate after 7 weeks. ### If they had to draw blood from the vein it was most likely a 4th gen test (antigen / antibody) which is 99.999…% accurate after 6 weeks or a DNA test (which is 99.9999…% accurate after like 1month). Trust me you don’t have hiv if you waited 7 weeks. Only hiv tests that are antigen take up to 3 months to yield and accurate result but those only require a drop of blood from a finger prick or an oral swab. You do not have HIV ### thank you man, I think it was 4th gen, because it has been around for a pretty long time (almost 12 years). ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIV/comments/rvxjwc/mu18/

rtzsnm,"Could I have gotten HIV? Possibility of HIV

For about 2 weeks now, I’ve had constant nausea and stomach issues (which never had before). First thought it nausea only after eating, but realized it’s 24/7 starting the moment I wake up. Was starting to think it is a stomach bug or other problem, but less confident in that now.

Saw a doctor who did some basic blood test and stool samples, that all came back normal. I know those aren’t std/hiv tests. Would they provide a hint that something like std/hiv or something else on the body is wrong?

Anyhow, last time I had intercourse was about 5 weeks prior to having the constant nausea. Searching online (which I hate but do anyway) has nausea as an early HIV sign. Is it possible to have gotten std or hiv that is causing nausea? If this happened any other time besides close to having sex would even think of this. Tested negative for everything at end of October and used a condom (but now not confident that it didn’t break). Thoughts? Seroconversion can cause gastrointestinal issues right?

rpjlna,"Well it happened, how where do I turn? I'm a male (27). Masc gay. 

It's official, I have been Diagnosed with HIV-1. 
On the 23rd of this month I was given the results over the phone.
I was standing in a shopping mall. 
Time stopped for a minute when it happened. 
I snapped back into my mind long enough to robotically drive home. I passed through my front door and instantly lost all control of my legs and fell flat. I cried incessantly. 

Now it's a few days later and nothing has changed. I still can't focus. I still have outbursts of crying, especially when I'm alone. I still feel numb. 

I was told I cannot get to a doctor till mid January. I feel overdramatic, but isn't this HIV, is it not taken seriously with priority number 1? I guess not. Holiday vacations are number one. It doesn't help with the stigma in my mind. 

Now I feel alone more than ever. I don't know where to turn to. The clinic I got this diagnosis from has been unprofessional and passé about my feelings and condition. 
I can't afford counseling.
My partner left me.
My family can't know.
A couple friends know, but have nothing meaningful to say. 
At the very minimum, I need a hug.

I have no position to really comment but I noticed no one else was. 
I have hpv and I’m a woman, so I risk cancer and had to get a biopsy and I’m waiting on results.
I don’t want you to think I’m comparing by all means because I can imagine this is worse for you.
I got curious about peoples stories of hiv because a friend of mine sister who is also my friend (a woman) got hiv from a partner who definitely knew he had it. 
I remember her telling me she wasn’t the same for months. Crying in the shower and just feeling gross all the time. 
Now I can not necessarily empathize with you other than I know how that feels to an extent and feeling like you’ve lost control of your own body and that someone did this to you. 
But it’s not your fault. 
You’re not gross and you’re not any different than you were before. 
There are lots of books, forums, and I’m sure groups for this because it does kinda shrink your dating pool a little bit which is okay! Just be honest with people from the start. 
You are strong enough to do this. My friend has been positive for about two years now and she was very suicidal in the beginning but now she is going to cosmetology school dating a nice guy and doing really well. 
Get a therapist, work on yourself, be honest and always wear protection from now on! 
I’m here for you and I’m rooting for you. Please don’t hesitate to message me or anything. 
Love ya friend! ### U need more tests to be certain. Please google covid and hiv cross reactivity. Being recently exposed to covid can false positive your hiv. This is new info in the. Medical field but it's real and false positive is more than u think nowadays with the covid pandemic. Even if u r hiv positive. U still can have a long healthy life if u start medications asap. ### I would really recommend reaching out to a local HIV service provider in your area. They will have medical case managers who can advocate for you and help you through all this. Also, there may be help with counseling, help with health care, dental care, housing, and, maybe most importantly, peer support. 

You will get through this month. I promise. ### Reach out to the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Foundation. They will help you pay for medications/healthcare if you don't have insurance, as well as other means of support.

It took me over a month after my first positive result to get in and see a doctor too. I made an appointment several months out, added myself to the wait-list, and they notified me that an earlier appointment was available and got in about a week later.

And could cause throat issues ! ### Hey man, I work as a doctor, and, although I don’t want to give out any advice on here, I hope I can help reassure you somewhat.  

There are so many different things that can cause a sore throat, and it is likely, although not guaranteed, that if you’ve had contact with your brother, and he has a similar illness, that you probably both have a virus or something. Strep isn’t the only thing that can cause a sore throat, but it’s a relatively common culprit, which is why it’s tested. For example, I had Covid a couple of weeks ago and had a sore throat. As far as visiting the sexual health clinic, that’s probably a good idea.  It’s very unlikely that you have caught HIV, but you are doing the right thing in being tested.  Chlamydia is very common, and very treatable. It’s also totally fine to be anxious about this - these things happen.  I’m hoping you feel better now, and I hope I’ve helped alleviate some of the anxiety. ### I’m trying  but my mind  just race’s some times most times ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIV/comments/rpe4av/feel_like_im_losing_my_mind/

rnyndg,"Hi :) I might have HIV and idk what to think. The backstory: I had sex and the condom broke, but he hid it from me and didn’t tell me… I know this sounds stupid but I didn’t realize at the time. He also admitted later to being positive and not - I don’t know the exact term - treated in a way where he‘d test negative again. 

So, I’ve heard the risk of getting HIV via sex (in this case: female (me) and male (him), vaginal) isn’t all that big. But I’m getting tested anyway. Better safe than sorry, right? My immune system isn’t perfect though, so I’m worried that my risk is higher, I guess.  I also have anxiety, which makes me dread the results. 

I wonder if someone here may clear up a few questions. :) 

- I read online that if you quickly find out, therapy is usually working quite well and will ideally get me to a viral load where I don’t test positive anymore. Right? So would I be any more likely to get sick or develop diseases? I didn’t quite understand the information there 
- One thing I’m kinda worried about is judgement. Even if I was not able to transmit it, I should still tell my partner I have HIV right?  Have you guys encountered anything bad? I suppose you’ll get declined every now and then, but have you also had people telling anyone etc? While I’d love to break the stigma, I‘d rather do it at my own pace. 
- Now this one might be a bit weird but bare with me. To those ones of you who have herpes - have you gotten more frequent outbreaks?

Thanks to anyone who took the time answering this. I am kind of in a bad place rn because I had to get tested and take a pregnancy test because someone I trusted didn’t want to „put up with me being annoying“ after the condom broke. Ugh! 

Anyways have a lovely day everyone :)",4,2021-12-24 19:36:36-05:00,"1. no, most people test pos on hiv tests no matter how quickly treatment starts.  the hiv test is testing for antibodies.  seroreversion **can** happen with extremely early treatment but it usually doesn't.  it's rare.  
2. no matter when u start treatment, early or late, medicine will almost always get u to an undetectable viral load.  that has nothing to do with whether u will still test positive for hiv.  u test positive for hiv if u have certain antibodies to hiv, not if yr viral load is detectable.  
3. if u start treatment, hiv will be suppressed and can't cause immunodeficiency.

stop future tripping.  u prob don't have hiv ### My bf had a viral load of 250,000 in 3 weeks in was 20 I believe it’s per liter of blood about 2 years ago they came out with undetectable = un transmittable. 
He suffers from nothing barely gets sick. I get sick more than he does. I knew him before treatment after infection. But I researched and got him on meds. We are taught in school it’s a death sentence. It’s not. Some will accept it some won’t.  My BF got it from his Ex and it took awhile to get it after unprotected sex it can happen the first time but that’s pretty rare from what I have researched.
Can’t answer the herpes question but I would assume it could cause an outbreak but it can be trigger from stress too my cousin has it and when she loses her mind and freaks it stresses her body bad and she’s gotten an outbreak. Also if your positive you still have to tell your partner even if undetectable. It’s a felony in some states. ### Did you get ur results ### Okay thank you :) I‘d figure I’d tell everyone just because you know, kind of seemed like a fair thing to do but I wasn’t sure about the legal aspect if you are undetectable :) thank you for your reply! ### ",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIV/comments/rnyndg/hi_i_might_have_hiv_and_idk_what_to_think/

1.) A person with HIV. 
2.) A person who doesn’t have HIV. 
3.) A way for HIV to escapa the body. In this case, through bodily fluids and HIV only lives in certain bodily fluids. 
4.) An act that requires said bodily fluids to enter the body through a mucus membrane. 
5.) Doing the act with no barrier and/or treatment as prevention. 

If one of those things is missing, there is no risk of an HIV infection.

I couldn’t stop looking at my body for symptoms and if you’re looking, you’re gonna find little things that are gonna make you go nuts. Long story short, I went to the ER and the doctors told me my tongue looked fine, it was just all in my head. As for the loss of appetite, when I did manage to calm myself down my appetite came right back. Took an HIV 4th gen test at 32 days and came back negative. If I had “symptoms” already I figured it come out positive if I had HIV, however im still gonna go for another one at the 3 month mark. Again, I can’t stress enough how important it is to stay calm. Of course it’s easier said than done. ### Highly doubtful , most symptoms wouldn’t show up till at least 2 weeks , maybe 1 week in some cases ### Majority never have symptoms ### Been trippin out cause my throats been hurting and  too now but hopefully everything goes good gonna test in a month ### Go get tested now. To my understanding, if you’re feeling symptoms already a 4th gen test would pick it up since it looks for antigens too, not just antibodies. Antigens show up before antibodies.

My problem is that I don’t know her health status and I was really scared that I might get HIV or any other std.
After 50 or 51 days I did a test called HIV Ag (p24) HIV Ab (type 1 + type 2). I don’t know if this is the 4th gen test.
Results came all negative as I did for other stds too.
I just worry that maybe I did this test too soon to have accurate results.

In general I get easily stressed and have anxiety about things.
I don’t think that I had any major symptoms. 
I remember I had bad throat for 1 or 2 days but I think I got cold as it was bad weather. And today I have a mouth ulcer (I usually have these). I think I brushed my teeth with a toothpaste that contains SLS.
I have been acting weird around my girlfriend as I am afraid to kiss her to not transmit her HIV now that I have an ulcer.

About 3 months ago I had unprotected sex with an individual that I did not know if HIV positive or not, so for that reason I decided to take PEP within 12 hours after the contact. I was tested for HIV 3 days after completing the PEP treatment and the results came back negative (I haven't yet been tested after 90 days as recommended).

I was reading online ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33902991/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33902991/)) and saw that there was one cases where the Covid-19 rapid test was wrongly coming back positive for individuals that were instead infected with HIV, I believe that the Covid rapid test was picking up on HIV antigens which was giving them a Covid false-positive result.

I apologize for the long post. I lost my virginity 3 months ago now. Vaginal sex was protected but I gave him oral and he came in my mouth without my knowledge and I accidentally swallowed it. About an hour or so later my vagina started to hurt. I went to planned parenthood got tested for everything including the finger prick test for hiv after 42 days and it came back negative. I then when to urgent care because the pain persisted and got tested again for everything including hiv through the 4th generation ab/ag test at 63 days which is roughly 9 weeks after possible exposure and the test was negative. I’ve been freaking out because I read online that persistent yeast infections is a symptom of hiv in women and my vagina is still in pain after 3 months. I’ve been prescribed pills and creams for my yeast infection but nothing seems to be working. Is it possible that I caught hiv from this situation and maybe my the test was negative because my body hadn’t developed symptoms at the time I took the test? I did tell him about what’s going on and he said he’s clean but you never know since people can sometimes lie. If anyone can offer some advice that would be great. Thanks in advance!",17,2021-12-12 04:31:04-05:00,"Don’t worry if the 4th generation was negative after 1 month so there are nothing,, you have to see Gynecologist ### Sound like BV. Have the doctors test for that they can give you something to clear it up. Its can throw everything off for months.your more likely to catch HPV than HIV really. Stop freaking out girl. Just use a condom and if you can take prep. talk to your doctor if you have sex with different partners. ### In regards to the whole hiv thing do you think there’s any chance that the test can turn positive at the 12 week mark? Also, I did go to a gyno about two weeks ago she said I had a yeast infection and prescribed me a cream and pills to take but I don’t think k they worked since I am still in pain. ### I got retested at the 3 month mark and everything came back negative. I’m still experiencing the same symptoms and I honestly don’t know what to do. Idk if it’s anxiety but I’m the back of my mind I’m still thinking maybe somehow the test was a false negative. It doesn’t help that I read about someone who tested positive at 6 months after testing negative at 3 months. ### No and HIV not easy to get or everybody would have it …THERE ARE NO DIAGNOSTIC SYMPTOMS FOR HIV only AIDS. If your test is negative then get another test and move on. ### I don’t think it will come positive,, go and make it for last time,,, im sure it’s negative,, and tell your gyno that the med not working,, and i will give you advice I hope it’s working with you (use saltpetre ( rock salt) as a wash ) Dissolve the salt in the water and wash the area and leave it 5 minutes and then wash it with water This helps reduce itching but still have to see doctor and tell the med not working ### And don’t look to symptoms because when i was Looking and waiting every day i get new symptoms ### I’m sure your fine and most of the time your anxiety can trigger symptoms of sickness because it affects the body too. I actually get sick from stress and worry, I also suffer from an genetic disorder and I have a shitty immune system I’m on PRep myself. But those cases are pretty rare with the positive test 6 months later.  I even know an elite controller that contracted it in ‘85. He’s still kicking has girlfriends and takes his ART because when he stress his body it l stops fighting, like getting an infection or flu . But he complains about his knee more than anything. But yours sound more that a bacteria infection of bacterial vaginosis than anything. Also having sex can totally screw up your ph and if he had a yeast infection on his body you could catch it from him . I’ve had that happen. Ask for a BV test at your Gyno or doctor. ### When I got tested they tested for BV but the results said the range did not seem like BV. I’ve also been diagnosed with a yeast infection all 3 times and the medication that they keep prescribing me do isn’t seem to help. I haven’t had any flu like symptoms or anything just the throbbing raw feeling that’s been non stop for the past 3 months. ### That’s strange but I wouldn’t say it’s a positive. Did they prescribe you diflucazole medicine? ### They gave me flucanizole (that one pill that you’re supposed to take for years infection 2x and it didn’t work). When I went to urgent care before I went to a gyno they prescribed me metronidazole pills which is used for BV and trich but the pain didn’t stop. Then when I went to the gyno she gave me the flucanizole pills and  the cream version which make the pain worse. When I went for a final check up at the 3 month mark she did the Pap smear said there was a little bit of discharge but she didn’t say if I still had a yeast infection or not. But like I said I got tested for everything under the sun and everything came back negative. The only thing I didn’t test for at the 3rd month mark was for hsv2 which I hard takes at least 12 weeks to show up in igg blood test. I was doing some research and came across something called vulvodynia which perfectly describes what I’m experiencing and I mentioned it to my gyno but she brushed me off. I don’t have health insurance and have already racked up a shit load of money just on lab tests. I feel like I’m losing my mind. ### I understand that. Do you live near a free clinic ?we have them in VA but the yeast infections are usually from ART kill both bad and good bacteria  that why most HIV positive get them more frequent then most. Not really because of HIV I just talked to my fiancé about it. He had fever flu and like rocking on the boat kinda it’s like being terribly drunk dizziness. ### Oo gotcha. I was under the impression that it’s a symptom of infection. The only “free” clinic near me is planned parenthood but if you want to see the nurse they charge you based on income which is still a good amount of money. ### But rest easy that is not a symptom it’s due to the volatility of the medication in the ART. So you got something else going on. internet is a double edge sword for information really. ### Yea I really need to stop googling symptoms but my anxiety gets the best of me sometimes. But thanks for the advice :) ### When I  go to the ID with my man next I’ll see if the docs got any suggestions for you ### Omgg thats really so sweet thank you so much! ### ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIV/comments/relks7/hiv_scare/

rbxvc9,"HIV exposure advice Alright. I know I have medical anxiety and I will do my best to not sound ignorant on this matter. 
I am a straight male in a relationship and do not use drugs. 
I work as a first responder. Two weeks ago, we responded to male in cardiac arrest. Half way through, family advises he has HIV. I did compressions and airway for awhile. No visible blood was ever seen. Gloves and PPE were obviously worn. 
After we got back to the station, I restocked our bags, and then had to go to the bathroom ASAP. After going #2, I wiped but noticed my palm was red. Hard to tell in the lighting if it was dried blood or just red from physical activity like CPR. Hypothetically speaking, even if it was dried blood and I wiped, and it made contact with my bum.. what kind of risk am I at? 
I know this sounds ludicrous and I’m sure it is. But two weeks from the day, I have sore throat, chills, rash, etc. the symptoms are so generic but everything lines up with acute HIV infection… which for someone with anxiety and a “potential” exposure.. it sucks!",9,2021-12-08 13:38:08-05:00,"This isn’t an exposure risk. 

Please better educate yourself on HIV transmission, as you are a healthcare worker. ### You're right. It does sound ludicrous.

Most likely it wasn't blood unless this gentleman was squirting blood out of his airway or an open chest-cavity. 

And even if it was dried blood and you licked it off your hand, you'd be fine.

rbab0g,"My story with hiv anxiety 19M. Alright here’s my story with HIV anxiety. My hope is that someone out there who has rly bad health anxiety is reading this and hopefully it’ll help calm your nerves (even if it’s a little). 

So 5 weeks ago I had drunken unprotected receptive anal sex with a guy I met at a bar. He told me he had been tested for everything 3 months prior and that he was on prep (he even showed me the pills). I don’t know why but afterwards I was terrified I had HIV. Not even any other stds, just hiv. I’ve always had bad health anxiety but this was just on a whole new level. It fucked me up. Every day for 5 weeks I was just plagued with thoughts of having hiv. I honestly couldn’t function anymore. I stopped hanging out with friends and just spent a majority of my time in my room. I became depressed. Every time I hung out with friends/family I would tell myself that this is the last time I could do it normally until I get that positive test back. Every waking moment, I was just thinking about having hiv. No matter how much I told myself all the facts, the chances of getting hiv from a random partner are under 1% in my case (ignoring the fact he was on prep). I convinced myself I had all the symptoms for it too. I would check my lymph nodes at least 6 times a day every day. No wonder they felt swollen. I got a little cough too and figured, oh well it’s hiv. My joints would feel weird, not even hurt, and I thought it was hiv. Well I just got my neg test back at the 5 week mark (4th gen test). So I know I definitely don’t have it. 

Moral of the story: if you get bad health anxiety like I do, just try and remember that the odds are stacked against you for getting this disease. Only 4K males in my entire state of Texas get hiv every year. Compared to the millions who get tested. The chances of getting hiv from an anonymous partner through the most riskiest type of sex (unprotected receptive anal) is still under 1%. (It’s like 1.8% if the partner is confirmed to have hiv). This is not an excuse to have as much unprotected sex as you want. Hiv is still very high in gay men for a reason. No babies = more unprotected sex. Just play it safe, wear a condom, know your partner, and get tested. AND DONT LOOK UP SYMPTOMS. Literally acute hiv Is the most basic disease ever. None of its symptoms are unique in any way to the virus. Just play it safe and if you think you were exposed get on pep it reduces your chances of getting hiv by like 95% or something in the high 90s. Good luck. I learned my lesson hopefully y’all will too.",18,2021-12-07 16:42:11-05:00,"It’s not 40% if the partner is confirmed to have HIV. It’s 1.8% 🙄 ### You are probably fine.

Don’t worry, the test are very accurate and you can also redo tests if you don’t feel  confident in the first one. False positives do happen but rarely.

r6xapi,"Hiv paranoia / help with test info 19M 
Alright so I had unprotectived receptive anal sex from two male partners about 4 weeks ago and then 5 weeks ago respectively. The one from 4 weeks ago was new and on prep. The one from 5 weeks ago I had fooled around with before (and tested negative for hiv after we filled around), however he was not on prep but said he was tested. I have been deathly paranoid of getting HIV from either of them. I’m not rly having symptoms, but every little thing (like if I cough, or if I I feel pain in a joint for an hour, or if I feel tired abnormally) is making me paranoid I have hiv. Also I think I have swollen lymph nodes but they’re all pea sized or smaller. 


NOW HERES MY QUESTION: I got an HIV blood antibody test today (negative) - it was from a truck Bc it was on my campus and free. My question is how likely is it that my body has produced antibodies for HIV 4-5weeks out such that they will be detectable on a test. I know the window period is 18days- 3months for this test. But what is the likely hood my body has produced antibodies now so they can show up on the test? Is it like 80%, 90%, or 50%? I’ve looked everywhere and even the nurse didn’t know. I’m getting a 4th gen test done next week I just got this test done today Bc it was free and I wanted it. Should I still be paranoid?",5,2021-12-01 22:14:40-05:00,"You’re more than likely fine, but if you keep letting people cum in your ass, you will become positive one day. ### 5 weeks is considered conclusive with the new tests.

At 5 weeks, the accuracy of a 4th gen HIV blood test would be 92-95%. ### Rule of thumb with these test, is 4 weeks, then 12 weeks from exposure.

r5jkmx,I just want to get this shit off my chest.  I am female. Basically I had unprotected vaginal sex with a new partner about 5 weeks ago. He says he’s clean. About 2-4 days after the first encounter I get a couple red spots on my chest that go away in less than a week. Then I get swollen lymph nodes in my neck that are just now getting smaller. I also started sneezing when lymph nodes became enlarged. I got tested for hiv around the 20 day mark (4th gen) and it was negative for antibodies and p24 antigen. I am currently waiting to get tested at the 45 day mark in order to get reassured. From the given information do you think it is likely I have hiv.

It sounds like you have a good plan and are knowledgeable. ### Only thing you can do is test, risk factors and symptoms are just that, it doesn’t confirm or deny. A negative test at 45 days or greater is conclusive evidence that you are HIV - so just wait for that test ### You need to take a test after the 45 day period if you want conclusive results. ### Hey girl. Im going through the same thing. 16 days post sexual act, negative test. I will be re testing in two weeks. ### Any updates? ### i love this article..!! ### I know no one here is but I just wanna see if the symptoms check out. I asked doctors and no one seems to be giving me a proper answer. The doctor testing me said she suspects other viruses more than she does hiv, but told me to get retested 3 months later. I cannot wait 3 months that’s why I’m getting tested 45 days. ### I read the p24 is usually detectable during the first 2-4 weeks of infection. So if I got a negative result at 20 days should that give me a little reassurance or does the result mean nothing? ### Yeah, I tested myself with insti hiv test kits during the 3 month waiting period and it was negative, then did the lab test (4th gen) and it was negative as well. Just goes to show when ur worried uve got an illness ur body manifests it’s symptoms. I kept on getting more and more symptoms even after this post but started fading away after I saw my negative result! ### It can give you reassurance that your current symptoms are not due to HIV as HIV symptoms are the result of your body’s response to elevated viral levels.

Did you receive penetration?
If so, did they finish inside of you?
Did you penetrate?
Receptive people are more likely to contract HIV than the one that penetrates.
It take 2 weeks to 3 months for HIV to develop, but you want to test every 3 months to be fully sure.
Most people don't develop symptoms, which means testing is the only way to be sure.
If you took the rapid test, that will show pretty well, but if you do the P24, then that will be more accurate, but according to many clinicians, nurses, and doctors I have spoken with over the past 3 weeks since my encounter, waiting the 3 months is going to be the best bet.

Unfortunately, due to being under the influence, I was not wearing protection for a less than 5 minute encounter. 

Fast forward to 16 days later I started to experience chills, redness, and folliculitis on my genitals (follicultis confirmed by Dermatologist). I stupidly took an Oraquick to test and it came up negative (what a waste of money on my part). 

On day 22, I took a full std panel that included a 4th generation blood test. While waiting for my results, on day 24, I got a fever, stomach pain, and loss of appetite which lasted 24 hours. I assumed the test would then be positive, but on day 25 I found out my entire std panel was negative. 

Since then (now week 6), I’ve had a very mild soar throat and I’ve also been diagnosed with Seborrheic dermatitis (by dermatologist), and follicultis on my butt (by dermatologist). The Seborrheic dermatitis is primarily on the scalp (medium discomfort) and chest (mild). I got  Seborrheic dermatitis on week 4.5. I plan on getting retested this week.

qxm7s0,"M28, potentially high risk. Hey guys! I just want to post these here, since I'm having extreme anxiety over this. Had an exposure, vaginal and oral. Vaginal mostly in condom, when I was without condom, I quickly realized(2-3 mins) what I was doing pulled out and just walked away. when I got home I inspected closely, noticed a small cut on my foreskin, most likely from the condom. 

I was calm for a few days, but I noticed slight tingling in my penis on day 3. Went and got checked, no gonorrhea or UTIs, but the doc said they found some fungus in my swab test, (potentially yeast?). Gave me a fluconazole 150 mg course for 7 days. After a visit, I had a funny feeling in my bladder and prostate for like 2 days. No discharge, no itching, no swelling, no white patches or anything really, no pain during urination, no raised temperature. It is weird, can yeast cause such symptoms in such a short timeframe? 2 weeks on and I feel like normal, except for a slight discomfort in my lower back, which can be ultimately caused by anxiety and worry.  

Has anyone had something similar? Should I go for additional chek-ups? What are the chances of contracting HIV in my case? Honestly, it is all I think about for the past few weeks... I can't work, can't sleep, can't do anything literally!  Any sort of advice and help would be appreciated ( i know I should get tested and everything will become clear, but it's too early at this stage). Serious answers only, please. I still kick myself for not going for PEP... 

 Thanks!",11,2021-11-19 13:21:20-05:00,"[deleted] ### [deleted] ### Thank you for replying! I have gone through tons of those too, papers, statistics, data of any kind available to a broad audience. I also found that Acute stages increase transmission rate, so do the STIs, and I have like a cut... that's what makes me extremely worried. Deep down I know that I most likely don't have it, but man do these thoughts tear my mind every minute of every day, what if I am wrong... Im basically 2 weeks on from exposure, and I'm monitoring symptoms that can arise during seroconversion stage, mainly fever, but the fact that my lower back hurts a bit makes me worried since myalgia is also a common symptom, although I have not found answers whether it can manifest on its own. ### Hey!

To be honest, I'm a very laid-back person, I love my life, I have everything that I need in terms of family, friends, money, and now I feel like because of basically 20-30 mins of my life I have put all on the scale. I see what you are saying, and most likely you are correct, but as I have said, this is the first time I have ever felt like this. Never had any STIs or anything... so it's my first exposure to something like this. Imagine, 28 years of age, a grown adult, and I'm scared shitless...  I try to stop, mind my own business, then I notice this weird feeling in my back, and it all starts over again... Searching for information about seroconversion, running for my thermometer, although I am certain I do not have a fever.

*Are you saying she is HIV+ and not on medication?*

No, i am not, I'm just assuming and trying to weigh the odds, considering my situation, especially considering that cut. ### [deleted] ### [deleted] ### [deleted] ### Last year, because I do not engage in high risk behavior normally, I have always, always use protection! I have no idea what got in me this time, alcohol to blame I guess... I can't say the same for the random girl I was with, she might have been a sex worker for all I know, all these possibilities make me very worried... ### I know i should stop... I'm a smoker, and I have started to smoke like 3 times more compared to what I normally do. This is taking a serious toll on my mental and physical health. I have never been more scared in my life. I am also scared to do the test in the coming weeks. ### Don't get me wrong, I believe you! But how on earth I got yeast( without any visual manifestation, though) and hell knows what else? That's where I'm coming from, if It's enough to get yeast, with enough viral load it can be enough for HIV, or am I getting this completely wrong? Honestly, assurance from the community means a lot for me! So thanks for that! ### [deleted] ### [deleted] ### Oh no, definitely not. She looked fine, nothing out of the ordinary. ### *Yeast infections are extremely common and aren't typically sexually transmitted. You can get them simply from eating too much sugar and being sweaty.*

But the results came from my urethra swab... also weird pain in the lower abdomen for a day or two? Maybe I should retest for chlamydia? 

*The large viral load has to get access to your blood.*

That is why I'm concerned because I had a cut...

*If a HIV+ drug addict injects himself with a needle, and then injects you with the same needle, what do you think are your odds of getting HIV?*

I would say something like 1-2% maybe 5%. ### [deleted] ### >*If a HIV+ drug addict injects himself with a needle, and then injects you with the same needle, what do you think are your odds of getting HIV?*  
>  
>I would say something like 1-2% maybe 5%.

I was curious about this question myself after your answer, so I looked it up: The CDC estimates it at about 0.63%: https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/estimates/riskbehaviors.html ### I hope you are right! Thanks! ### I am by no means an expert on the matter, but I would suggest it might be higher in practice.

Not everyone uses medications or is aware of their status. In addition, if you are injecting heavy drugs on common occasions, I would imagine looking out for a sore throat or fever might be the least of your concerns to detect it early on. ### Transmission rates are impossible to measure accurately. We can't purposely inject 10,000 people with HIV-contaminated needles and count how many end up contracting HIV. While that would give you an accurate estimate (the more people we inject the better!), it wouldn't exactly be ethical. So I guess the CDC's methodology to estimate the transmission rate is the best we can do. Also, the assumption inherent in this estimate is that you get injected by a needle that was previously injected into someone who is already known to be HIV+. The chances of getting HIV after being injected with a needle previously injected into someone with unknown HIV status would be lower. ### ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIV/comments/qxm7s0/m28_potentially_high_risk/

qusrxc,"Need to calm myself I'm a 22 gay guy and I was actively engaged in some unprotected sex with multiple different partners from hookup apps until about a year ago but I also got tested for HIV at my local clinic every 3-6 months depending on how active I was sexually. My last negative test was in December of 2020.

It had been almost a year since my last test and I had stopped hooking up with such random people. The only encounters I have had in 2021 was with a handful of men (5 or 6) and the only sex we had was oral with me being the giving party.

Now I went to get tested last week as I was running errands and thought why not and the test came back positive for antibodies but not antigens, we went through all the motions of getting me started on medicine and setting an appointment with the clinics doctor and all that good stuff so I've been on Biktarvy for almost a week now. The clinic workers mentioned that this test is considered a preliminary test as it could be a false positive (although they said false positives are rare) and they sent me to get more blood drawn and sent away for more in depth lab work which I went and did same day. 

I've known about HIV since I was a teen and have been even more active in my own education surrounding it for a while so I know it's not a death sentence and it's possible to live a normal life with proper treatment and care given. 

In the end my question is really just how concerned should I be for my results? I know it's not the end of my world and I know this won't change my life to some crazy degree but I still have that nagging crumb of worry in the bag of my mind telling me worst case scenarios.",5,2021-11-15 17:53:18-05:00,"false positives aren't that rare.

but we have no way to predict if yr a false pos.  u just have to chill and wait for yr results.

yr timeline doesn't tell us how long after yr last hi risk activity yr last neg test was.  if yr dec 2020 test was 3-6 mos after yr last unprotected hi risk sex, then it's prob a false pos.  it's not impossible to get hiv from giving oral, but it's real unlikely.  but we can't tell from yr deets if u could've been in the window period during yr last neg test.

the worst case scenario isn't that bad.  with one pill a day, almost everyone w a new infxn can be undetectable in short time, never experience immunodeficiency, and be incapable of infecting their sex partners.  it's about as easy to manage as any chronic disease that exists. 

so just chill and wait for yr results.  pcr will prob be back before diff assay.  it's just a few days.  yr letting yr anxiety get the better of u.

i've had hiv since 83.  it used to be a horrible disease.  now it's really nbd. ### [deleted] ### So how did it go? ### My negative test in December of 2020 was taken about 2 months after I took a step back and stopped engaging in risky hookups. So since then I haven't done much other than giving oral to a few men which I know comes with risk still but less so than penetrative sex acts. 

Being chill is easier said than done lol but I'll try.

I had a random hook up with a guy last night. (I was the top, he was the bottom), afterwards he told me that he’s had guys round all night to his doing BB sex. I was like “WHAT?!” I would’ve never not used a condom if I’d have known this information, as I ejaculated inside him. He also told me, he is undetectable for HIV. I am fully panicking that I have it, or have been exposed to it. Not only because of him, but because of the other guys sperm inside him (which I was not aware of before I met him). What do I do? Do I call my doctors and ask for PEP?",18,2021-11-14 16:55:58-05:00,"You should go to the emergency ASAP and try and get some PEP.

I am praying, like nothing ever before. I suffer with anxiety badly, and it’s one of the only times (bar being with someone) I haven’t used a condom. I keep getting thoughts in my head that this guy would purposely not take his meds to infect guys, (sounds ridiculous) and makes me realise how stupid that sounds out loud. I also when in this state, can’t trust science until I see a negative result in 90 days. Long waiting game. Thankyou so much for your advice! ### Realistically though, as a top the risk is very very low. And if that person were on HIV meds that makes it completely untransmittable according to health authorities and the CDC and all of the research we have on it. ### Heya. Yes I am currently on PEP. Day 2! It’s a silly mistake I made. It’s one of the only times in my life (bar being in a relationship) where I have NOT used a condom, and was about to go for PrEP consultation next week. I am living with the regret tho. It’s going to be a long 3 month wait I think. ### Yes. I got on PEP around 43 hours. So a little later than I should’ve purely because of my anxious thoughts taking over my mind. 

I’m so annoyed with myself as I was due to start PrEP and let someone (not blaming) but change my ways of not using a condom, through heat of the moment. It’s actually shook me up extremely and I’m struggling each day so I will 1000% be protecting safe sex after this. I hope the PEP can work. Any idea on when I can take a test after finishing prep? ### If you were the top your risk is already very low. 

Second, If that person was on HIV meds (undetectable) It is not possible to transmit the virus.

But as an anxious person I would still recommend doing pep for your own sanity ### Well I pray you will be okay. Try be strong and meditate so you can focus. ### [deleted] ### Thankyou so much.

Tbh. I think he seems like a genuine guy who (correct me or tell me if this is wrong to say) but wants sex so doesn’t shout it, and so he shouldn’t have too. Not excusing him in the slightest because I 1000% think he’s a piece of shit, and when I get my negative result I am gonna give him a piece of my mind. However, on his Grindr profile: “he says be clean and tested” which he said is for general STI’s. I asked him numerous times before, after, and when I got home if he was on PrEP. He said he promised. Then found that out, and he said that they were the same. I’m beating myself up for my awful judgement, but I can’t help but feel so angry at his decision too. ### Definitely never trust anyone's word again. We can all say we were tested it's so easy to lie, and especially to get what you want.  Im sure you are fine and you got on the meds. Just take it easy, I heard 4th generation can detect at 4-6 weeks. ### Ah Thankyou so much. I will 100000% never trust anyone again.

There is always precum too if they didn’t ejaculate in your mouth. I don’t know when this possible exposure happened, but HIV symptoms take 2-4 weeks to show up.

Another one at 3 months and one more time at 6 months just to make sure. ### Mine happened at like 5-6 days.

My doctor did a rapid strep test which came back negative. He thought mine was strep based on presentation with the fever, white spots, sore throat and no cough.

qtfe30,"Health care provider that recently came in contact with blood and accidental needle stick. Hello forgive me but I’ve been recently freaking myself out over these exposures. 

I’m a early 20s male with only one sexual partner for the last 4 years.

Exactly 16 days ago I was starting an IV in a patient and when I went to occlude the vein and place the saline lock her blood squirted and ran down my arm into my glove. It was a decent amount of blood as she had very high blood pressure. I instantly wiped my hand with an alcohol based disinfecting wipe. She stated that she did not have anything but the next day noticed I had some small scabs on hand so I’ve been very stressed about it. 

Two days ago I had a diabetic patient who just got out of prison after 13 years. When I went to pick up his blood glucose machine I got a small prick from one of his needles he uses to test himself. No blood was drawn from my hand and he also denied having anything and denied being sexually active in prison. 

Since last night I’ve been very warm and sweating from my palms and soles of my feet. I just noticed that I’ve had a a very mild headache for the last few days and have not been able to eat more then a few bites a day. Ive been researching the early signs of the disease ever since and it has caused a serious amount of stress for me. 

I’m sorry for posting here but I’m currently part time and am not covered by insurance. I’m struggling hard financially and when looking into places to get tested for hiv and hepatitis they want me to at least bring in 50 dollars which is going to put me at risk of not paying rent this month. Since my current employer is privatized I’m worried if I go to them they will blame me for not using proper practices which my put me farther into my financial situation. 

More about myself I drink at least 6 days a week at anywhere from 3-8 drinks a day. Smoke marijuana multiple times a day (over the last few days I have not smoked at all due to anxiety.) And am fairly healthy otherwise. 

Any input would be great and sorry if this post upsets anyone.",3,2021-11-13 20:54:08-05:00,"u don't have hiv.  you've never been exposed.

qtbl93,Is there any straight males Who have caught hiv from a female after one hook up,19,2021-11-13 17:21:52-05:00,"Yeah. I am sure that someone somewhere has been the unlucky one. 

However, the chances of a female passing hiv to a male are extremely small. If she was positive the risk is 0.04% to be exact. ### My brother found out he had it when he went to the hospital with pneumonia. They tested him and had a cd4 count of 9. Luckily his fiance that he was with for 6 years didn't get it. He is straight and never had a drug problem. They have married and had 2 kids since. She is still negative and so are the kids. ### [deleted] ### Lol if you have anal sex with a woman (Heterosexual sex), the chances are the same as if you were with a male. Some oh the Hetero men didn’t get it from vaginal. ### Yeah I see that I was just curious on how many people it has actually effected like from a one off ### that per act risk of 1 in 2500 is a very americocentric perspective based on [a single meta analysis of 3 studies.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4467783/)

there are other studies with much higher infection rates.

[in a study](https://journals.lww.com/aidsonline/fulltext/2005/07010/high_probability_of_female_to_male_hiv_1.1.aspx) of uncircumcised kenyan men sleeping with multiple women found a per act transmission rate of 1 in 159

[a study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7904668/) of female to male transmission from thai sex workers found a per act transmission risk of 1 in 33. 

people on this sub seem determined to minimize or even deny the possibility of hetero transmission to men based on personal experience or a number from a single study.  ignoring all the contrary evidence. ### I’m glad he’s okay and wow 6 years and didn’t pass it on i guess it’s just luck if you get it or not ### 6 years 
Wow! ### I had bad anxiety before I read that it has completely made it go away thanks for taking the time to clear that up really has made a big difference ### But what's if you happen to have sex with her on her period. Are the risk factors greater now?
Are you now at a higher risk? ### Oooh. Idk. But I do know I had 2 partners that I slept with over 2 years when I didn’t know I was positive and neither of them contracted HIV ### Both of those studies are very, very old… HIV wasn’t even truly understood when these were done. ### [deleted] ### Oh so it actually really hard for a male to catch I guess it would be easier for female to catch from a male, how did it make you feel having it ? Like did you have anythink that seemed off with your body before you found out you had it ### I've tested negative twice but only got a white town after I had intercourse as well as pains in my neck. Itchy and discolored skin I've notice it spread from a small area to my entire back. 
Also have small red boils that is appearing all over my body. ### No. I had no idea. 

I thought I was being tested for ‘everything’ when I went to get my birth control shot every 3 months.

But I switched doctors and when I asked for everything he was like “HIV too?” And I said “yeah obviously. Everything.” So, I just thought I was getting a routine test and boom, came back positive.

I truly had no idea. The only thing I will say is that I was sooooo fatigued. I was diagnosed with a CD4 of 201 - an AIDS diagnosis is 200 and lower. So, I was very sick and I literally just thought I was depressed because I wanted to sleep all the time. Turns out my body was literally shutting down… but that was the only major indicator I really had - and I misread it.

A few months earlier I had joked to my friends that I thought I had hiv because my arms were falling asleep all the time - but, “haha”, we all laughed it off because straight females don’t get hiv right? 🙈 ### [deleted] ### How long did u have it before u found out ? I read some were that it can take up to 10 years to show symptoms, and how are you finding life now ? Are you doing okay? ### Seriously! 😥 ### I think i just died inside. ### They estimated I was infected 2 years prior to finding out based on my bloodwork.

I’m doing fine!  It honestly does not effect my life that much. The stigma and the way society treats people with hiv is the worst part. The virus itself really doesn’t impact my day to day life. 

I am still able to date, have kids, travel etc… ### Oh really wow that was fast from what iv ready crazy how something so serious like hiv can give of virtually no symptoms I’m glad it don’t effect your life, also are you open about it? Or do you just keep it to a need to no bases ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIV/comments/qtbl93/is_there_any_straight_males/

My life is nothing anymore and this thoughts and having to wait a few more weeks is gonna kill me.so rather end this shit myself .I just wish I had the strength to keep on.but I don't .no more .😭😭😭😭😭",24,2021-11-12 10:21:16-05:00,"Hold on. I also was worrying so much. But you have to keep in mind that hiv is rare and the transmission rate is also low. Just wait for the results. Even if it is positive there are medications to live a healthy life as I read. I see you were on PEP too. Wtf dude, I think you should not worry. ### You are having extreme intrusive and illogical thoughts as a result of an extreme trauma you recently went through. It’s your brain’s way of coping and it’s not your fault in any way. 

You need to urgently seek medical care in the form of therapy/a psychiatrist. You don’t have to stay like this. This is not You forever, just as a broken arm would heal with the correct care, so can your brain/mental health. But if you don’t get professional help you will probably never get better and this will spiral even further.

There is no point anyone telling you you don’t have hiv, no point in anyone pointing out you didn’t even have an exposure. No point in people giving you statistics, being empathetic or being annoyed at you. Your brain is not functioning properly at the moment so you will ignore all the logic and focus only on the obsessive and intrusive thoughts.

You need to seek urgent help for your mental health. Now. Please PLEASE. Please don’t delay even any other day. ### Yes south Africa ### You don't understand,yes I was on pep,bit I bought a HIV test on Wednesday and that was negative but my mind says that the lancet was tainted by HIV blood before packaging.i can't wait for another 12 weeks.or whatever weeks .I'm sick of this waiting shit. My previous exposure was a blood draw right and yes I do know everything im saying is irrational but it's real it's all real for me. please tell me I'm crazy to think that a new lancet inside a bought HIV test will infect me with hiv.i just need help here please😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 ### It's now about the lancet I used that was provided in the test itself.it could've been tainted with HIV blood and now I am doomed.i can't nmre ### I don't have any funds for that rite now .they just give me anti depressants and I hate taking it .I want help so badly ,😭😭😭😭😭😭 ### U have no idea what u did for me ,u made me pull thru a night and not take my own life .thank you .I'm gona try to make it thru another day. ### Please help me ### This is literally insane. No one can taint a fucking needle in a package first of all, it was made in a factory. Even if it was tainted, which is just stupid thought, the blood would be dried and the virus wouldn’t survive. It dies within seconds of being exposed to air, outside the body. And even if you did have it, which you don’t, it wouldn’t make life not worth living. It’s in your head. It’s a virus, that is treatable with a pill a day. Or an injectable a month, and whatever the next few years of research brings. Yeah, it’s scary not knowing, I’m going through the same thing, but mines actually real. But what makes it not scary is seeing all the people that are completely fine and have been for 20-30 years before the medicine that exists today. They probably read your comment and roll their eyes. ### Where are you based in SA? If you let me know then I can help you look for a charity etc that may be able to help. ### Where in SA? ### Cape town ### Let me see if I can find some numbers/contact details from charities to see if anyone can help you. I will try :) ### Thank you so much ### TEARS foundation is based in SA and helps anyone in need (the charity is for ppl who have been sexually assaulted) regardless of ethnicity, race, culture etc. The free helpline number *134*7355# - Available 24/7. 

You must please phone NOW. Explain how you have been feeling - and tell them everything you’ve been feeling - include feelings of suicide and extremely intrusive and obsessive thoughts about hiv. They can arrange counselling for you. You will not be judged so please make sure they understand the seriousness of your current state.

Another organisation is Rape Crisis SA - another 24/7 helpline available on 0214479762
Also - on their website https://rapecrisis.org.za/ you can actually WhatsApp them - so that may be even easier for you. 

Remember that you deserve help for what you’ve been through. What you are feeling now (this obsession with hiv) is directly caused by the trauma you’ve faced. 

If you get therapy and proper help from these charities you can start to work on getting better mentally. You have to start the process, so please promise me you will contact them. You can start with saying this:

“I was sexually assaulted/raped X years ago and I’m really struggling to cope. I’ve become obsessed with hiv, even though I don’t have it, and I’m having really intrusive and never-ending  obsessive thoughts about hiv. It’s got so bad that I keep convincing myself I have it, and I’ve even felt suicidal lately due to the extremity of these thoughts. I really need help and am please asking you if you can help me find therapy to address these problems as soon as possible.” ### U can't believe u helping me😭😭😭😭😭thank you so much ,thank you .I'm gona WhatsApp them rite now ### Well done :) I feel sure that somebody will be able to help you. Once you get proper help everything will start to sort itself out and I am 100% you will get through this!xx ### I have reached out already and I am talking to someone rite now .thank you please stay in touch with me.pls .I am fighting this thoughts where I see how irrational my thoughts are that I cudve been infected by a lancet provided with the HIV test kit but then I get a what if thought ### Well done! I’m really proud of you for contacting them - you are doing the right thing by getting help!

When you start freaking out come back to this comment and read it over and over:

“I 100% do not have hiv. The reason I am worrying about this is because of trauma that happened to me in my past. My obsession with hiv is my brain’s way of trying to cope with things. These thoughts are not based on logic and I am not at any real risk. I am getting help from a charity. With the help of others I WILL get better and I won’t have these extreme thoughts anymore.” :)

I’m going to bed now (different time zone to you) but will check in with you in the morning! ### Thank you ,I can't thank you enough😭😭😭😭 ### How are you doing? ### Hi ,u are my guardian angel .I am doing actually ok.i have a counselling session tomorrow. what I can't believe is how u helped me.it makes me Wana cry.thank you so much 
🙏 ### That’s no problem at all. I’m just so happy for you and that you have the counselling session tomorrow!

qs17uh,"Hi So in the last six months i’ve been seeing this girl who i met on Bumble. We would have safe sex and sometimes unprotected sex. But recently around August, she had a strange incident where she got blacked out at a party and someone took advantage of her. But she didn’t know this because she was blacked out of course. probably a week and half after this incident we met up and had unprotected sex. We don’t talk for about 3 weeks. she calls me out of the blue and tells me she pregnant and we’re both freaking the hell out becuz we are not dating and do not want children. So a couple days later she has me drive her to PlannedParenthood where they told her she was almost 6 weeks due. Me being stressed the fuck out, didn’t even line the dates up correctly from the last time we’ve hooked up. Weeks go by and she gets an abortion (pill). maybe a few days after she called me in confusion told me how odd it was that the dates don’t match up with when we last hooked up to how far along she was when we first went to PP. She pretty much connected the dots and told me the dates line up exactly to when she got blacked out at her friends house. i can’t tell you how bewildered we both were and the expression in her voice nearly had me tearing up. she said she was most likely r****. we both aren’t talking much now but i try to check in on her and listen to whatever is going thru her mind. she’s severely depressed and is not ready to go get tested for std’s. But my anxiety is so bad and all i can think about is the possibility that i contracted HIV and the thought of telling my strict christian parents that i’ve been seeing a girl and got an STD. i have no symptoms of HIV but i know that doesn’t necessarily rule it out. i just have the worst anxiety ever and feel so alone. where should i get tested? and what are some things i should be asking when i see a MD? sorry for the long winded post, i have very few people i talk to and none of them know about my situation.

Especially if taken within 72 hours ### My ex boyfriend is a surgeon & got pricked by an hiv needle 4 weeks ago and started pep immediately. However it’s been a month and I feel scared Bc I have been sick recently that I have hiv. I’m scared to get tested. We did not have sex after he got pricked but did other stuff. ### You do not have HIV. 8 weeks with modern tests are conclusive. 

When we are anxious we make correlations where there none. Stuffy nose has nothing to do with hiv. 

You’re okay! You do not have hiv! Go for a walk and celebrate! ### yeah... i mightve developed a phobia after my recent first encounter.... im still literally scared... ### Agree ### Thank you so much,what I don't understand is I never even had sex,I just had a blood draw and the needle was clean ,it was a white plastic tube they used that I was scared about and yes i was on pep ### I think u safe ### I wish I cud,I bought a HIV test and it came out negative but now my head is telling me that the lancet that is provided was tainted with HIV blood or plasma and now I am doomed.i hate myself .really I can't go on like this nmre,it's a nightmare that doesn't end and I have contacted the manufacturer of the test and they have said that it is clean and new sterile lancets but what if they are lyieing.i know how this sounds trust me but it's my reality and in it it is so real. ### I just checked out some of your posts: seems like a zero risk experience you had. As an MSM (man who has sex with men), I would suggest going on PrEP. It would hopefully put your mind at ease about getting HIV in the future. Side effects are very rare. ### You think? ### yeah.. realized its pretty unlikely for me to contract it.. its just my anxiety is taking a toll on me and my body. its really hard to cope up with it since that encounter.. it was pretty traumatizing when HIV crossed my mind cause i knew then there needs to be an exchange of fluids in order to contract it.. 

but thank you! will definitely get into it on my next encounter! ### It (PrEP) is something you do before an encounter; it stands for pre-exposure prophylaxis. It's a daily pill, though there's also an option called 211 where you take 2 pills before an encounter and 1 pill 24 and 48 hours after. ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIV/comments/qqhc7b/very_scared/

And on that same week two itchy rashes on legs and on the left arm. They look like faded patches now. Did the home oraquick  twice and they both were negative. The anxiety is obviously making things worse. Insomnia, itchy skin, breakouts, headaches and stomach issues. Has anyone experienced similar symptoms?",10,2021-11-09 18:45:00-05:00,"What’s your sex (male/female) and what kind of sex was it? Oral/anal/vaginal and were you recipient or giver? What country do you live in? Do you have any other stds? Do you know the status of the sexual partner or can you ask? Unprotected sexual inter course always carries a risk - but we can’t give you actual statistics until we know all of the above. ### I don’t know where I read that the test only detects HIV AB AG and no the disease itself. Anyways, thanks for your feedback :) ### You do not have hiv! 

These things can be anything don’t worry. 

If you had symptoms your test would have been positive (: 

You’re 100% fine ### You need to educate yourself on hiv. ### Female, recipient vaginal and oral sex. The guy got tested for hiv and the results were negative. But my gut tells me he may have AIDS. He didn’t look sick at all but I talk to him regularly and he has mentioned he hasn’t feeling well this year. Colds, weakness and got his gallbladder removed last year. I thought ok this has been an stressful year for everyone and it’s ok to feel under the weather.  But now I don’t know if he is lying to me about his health and he is actually feeling a lot worse. I feel like there is not other way to be certain that getting tested but I just can’t get my head around this situation. I thought I knew this guy, it’s an old friend of mine. We used to have sex, sometimes unprotected and never had an issue with it. He thinks i am crazy for believing he may have had HIV but I haven’t made up all these symptoms. He is from Mexico btw. Thanks for replying :) ### I understand that these symptoms can be anything, but they happen to appear weeks after possible exposure. Just looking to see if anybody has experienced such symptoms or if I can trust the two oraquick (oral swab) negative results I got.  Also, I had covid last winter plus got vaccinated recently so I don’t know if these are also contributing to what I am experiencing. My doctor is now telling me that I am paranoid, smh! ### Ok, so the important thing to note here is that hiv can’t be diagnosed purely on the basis of symptoms. The reason for that is that symptoms that are attributed to hiv (whether the acute or latent stage) are very general symptoms and could apply to a whole range of different illnesses - including non-serious common viruses that are passed around. So many people get colds - I can think of a few of my friends who have been ill all year round with similar things and def don’t have hiv/aids! The gallbladder thing may be connected to AIDS but if he had reached the AIDS stage you’d probably know about it - he’d be and look incredibly sick and probably hospitalised. Not just a few colds here and there.

The other important thing to note is that he tested negative. Why not ask him to send his evidence to you? If he’s a straight male then it’s rather unlikely he has it in the first place - unless he is bi or has a preference for trans women or injects drugs. The prevalence rate in Mexico is also low (0.3%) and the majority of the Mexicans with hiv are men who have sex with men. 

I am very doubtful you have hiv, but the only way to know for sure is to do a blood test. ### The thing is that I was in my best shape and health before all this happened. He sent me his negative results but not sure if I can trust this if he is in a latent stage as I assumed. Will a negative result  from a blood test be conclusive from a person who has AIDS? He considers himself a straight guy but I remember he used to ask me to do anal sex and I never agreed. I guess the only way to find out is getting a blood test at this point which I am just not ready just yet. I am still trying to process all this and the fact that is happening with a guy i trusted. So stupid I know… ### Yes a blood test would definitely be conclusive if they have AIDS - a blood test looks for hiv antibodies and these would exist  whether he has hiv or AIDS. The only way the test would be negative but he is actually positive would be if he was tested in the window period (eg the time just following infection when antibodies may not yet show up in the blood). 99% of ppl with hiv will have antibodies within 3 months, though.

You should do a hiv test or else you’re gonna stress and make yourself sick just from worrying so much. I’m very sure you’ll be negative and at least once you’ve done the test, you’ll be 100% sure of that. ### Hahahahahhahahahhaha omfg ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIV/comments/qqgmkb/are_these_hiv_symptoms/

In the meantime I need to get tested for hep, its the only tests I haven't done yet.

Symptoms persist. So really not relaxed about anything yet. ### You do not have hiv! ### If you really had symptoms because of the hiv you would get tested positive by 4th gen test at that time. You get symptoms because the viral loads are very high during the acute phase which means there is enough amount of p24 proteins for the 4th gen test to pick it up and the body will also starts making antibodies to the virus. The 4th gen test will pick up either antigens or antibodies. So I can say that those symptoms were not related to the HIV if you test is negative. Get tested at 12 weeks with any test for the peace of your mind. Many experts and many countries guidelines say 4th gen test are conclusive at 6weeks post exposure. I am in same situation my friend. My 8 weeks test is negative and will retest at 12 weeks. ### Same here .. same symptoms Was there ..Took pep after 48 hours … now tested at 13 weeks after exposure with 4th gen ### My tests were negative after 12 weeks.

Read up on HIV. Be educated. It’s not that big of a deal in the long run. 

Again, treat him as you always have. ### Do's: be supportive and ensure he takes his meds 
Don't: push too hard 

Everyone responds differently, but it's big he even told you. I have zero plans to tell my family except maybe my sister. ### Yeah just be the same. You don't want them to fell as though they are being treated differently because of it. A year and a half in is still pretty fresh. The fact they told you is huge. Just be there when they need. It's world ending at the beginning. But once treated and you can wrap your head around it. It's a very manageable condition. Education on the subject is very important from valid sources. It has come a long long way. ### I agree with this take on the situation. ### Thank you for responding! And yeah that part does come natural to us. I fell like I'd anything we're all more saddened that he kept this to himself for a year and a half. That's a huge load to carry on your own. We're a pretty expressive family and big on the being there for him. We all went to a stay show with him for his coming out party things like that. So he should've have to have been going through this life changing news on his own. The actual sickness part of also saddening but we know it's manageable. Though if he didn't tell is for a year is why I come to this subreddit. Maybe we do something that caused him not to tell us. I've been reading a lot of things posted here by others and I'm learning at lot about the Illness. Thank you all! ### He was kind of forced to it. He started acting weird and thinking he was being followed and hacked disconnected the wifi and all speakers. Went to the bank and thought people were plotting against him. Real manic like. So when talking to him and seeing who would follow him and going with his flow someone asked if he had taken drugs (in a non condescending tone) lately because we wanted to give him Benadry (all we had at hand) to help him sleep but didn't want to mix it with anything and he told us his medication. Obviously we were all in shock when we found out the use of the medication. We all love him so much. ### Thank you for responding. Yeah the Fam talked about it on our own and as a base some of us thought the LEAST we could do on a daily basis was causally ask him every day if he's taken his medication for the day. Not supper pushy we just don't want to have a stretch where he's forgetting. We feel we're pretty open minded about everything like when he told us he was gay a couple years back no one really cared but this is literally life changing so we don't want to stress him or anything since it's literally messing with his well being ### Manageable is even too strong of a word for HIV. He will have to take a pill a day and that’s that. He won’t get sick, he won’t die from AIDS, his appearance won’t change from HIV, if he’s taking meds he cannot spread the virus to others (ie. he can have relationships with negative people so long as they are educated), it won’t affect how he’s feeling day to day etc. 

I am not trying to downplay the severity of untreated HIV, but with treatment, life doesn’t change. One just takes a pill every day. In fact, there is an injection that has recently been approved that is monthly. Just one shot a month and no pills. I have a coupon friends that are on it. They love it. 

If he doesn’t have health insurance, make him an appointment with the county/city/office because there are resources to help pay for his medication and to see doctors because he is HIV positive. ### He sounds like he should be seen by a professional for his paranoia. Likely has nothing to do with HIV itself but maybe he’s having a hard time accepting that he’s positive or maybe this was something that was underlying. ### Is he taking meth or any recreational drugs? Are you sure he is positive? Some people get their hands on atripla to feel high. ### Thank you for responding!. And yes we agree. He slept all day yesterday and we couldn't get his doctor's information from him. And we thought it best for him to sleep. When he woke up at 6 (he told us who his doctor is and by that time his doctor had closed for the weekend) he ate like he hasn'd seen food in years but he was normal again. Said he hadnt slept well in days and the Benadryl did help. 

I figured I'll monitor him all weekend and see if he can sleep ok again without Benadryl or niquil. Just naturally. If he can't that's another thing I'm mentioning to his doctor come Monday ### His medication is BIKTARVY is that the same thing?

qnh4lt,"Anonymous call saying I (F25) was exposed I got a call last night from the health department saying that an anonymous partner had put me down as a sexual partner and someone who was exposed to HIV. I used to teach sex Ed, I know hiv isn’t a death sentence, I know it’s completely manageable, i know undetectable= untransmitable. But the social stigma is terrifying, the thought of how it would impact my life is scary. 

I immediately called a friend for support, found a rapid home testing kit and took it. The results said negative. This morning I went and had my blood taken bc I know rapid tests can’t be 100% accurate, but it’s a Friday so it’ll be mid next week before I get my results. 

I’ve only had two sexual partners this year, unfortunately didn’t wear a condom with either.

If it is him, he didn’t cum inside me. In the end it doesn’t matter, I don’t blame whoever gave it to me and I don’t resent them. I made the decision to not use condoms just as much as they. Also it could be a partner from any time of my life, doesn’t have to be a recent partner. But 2 years ago I moved states and the health department called from my current state which makes me think it’s more recent, which is relieving. I called my primary care doctor and told them of the exposure, rapid test and how I’m waiting on the blood work. I asked if I should take any medication currently even tho I could’ve been exposed a long time ago. Waiting for a call back. 



If I’m being honest, I am REALLY freaking out. I keep imagining how this will impact my future relationships and life and expenses. I’m trying to accept that this might just be my life so that I’m more prepared for the positive, but I’m so afraid. I’m scared I’ll never find a relationship. I’m scared doctors will treat me different. Im scared of the financial impact. I’m scared to disclose to close people in my life. I have paper thin skin and bleed easily and I’m scared for the people around me. 

I know I don’t know the results yet, I don’t feel comfortable telling anyone else in my life yet, and I just needed to let it out in a safe place. I hope I have not offended anyone, I know this is manageable. I just need a safe place to share my fears and feelings.",8,2021-11-05 14:15:01-04:00,"Ahhh I feel so much for you. It’s a really scary time and I imagine anyone would be incredibly fearful if they got such a call, even though you have all the info/facts/figures and know that these days hiv is nothing more than a manageable health condition for which you’d probably only need 1 pill a day. The stigma is of course the real factor here - but times are changing. People are much more clued up on U=U, PrEP, PEP, that hiv isn’t a life sentence (far from it, in a lot of developed countries poz ppl have higher life expectancies than neg)! And there will be a cure within the next 5 years - I’m quite sure of it!

In terms of dating etc - if you get bad news (and maybe in the meantime to ease your worries) you should watch Jennifer Vaughan videos on YouTube. She’s this amazing woman who has totally embraced her status, she’s completely at peace with it and she wants her face to be out there telling ppl it’s ok! That she lives a completely normal life! She was married (split now not due to her status) and is now dating again. She holds down her old job. She has told everyone and made herself public! Such a cool lady.

But 2bh most of this is irrelevant. I do doubt you’ll be poz based on the result of your rapid. Rapids are extremely reliable and highly accurate. I think you’re negative. Obviously you’re doing the right thing by getting blood tests, but I have high hopes for you.

Either way, you will be ok! You will - I promise! ### So sorry you're going through this! this is a safe place and we are here for you. If you've passed at least 6 weeks from your last exposure, the chance of getting a false negative rapid test is very very low. I think you're fine also you're not alone, many have had close calls. I had a false positive result and literally almost passed out from the shock so EVEN if your first 4th gen comes reactive until it's confirmed it still could be false positive. So just relax don't worry about something until you have a tangible reason to worry. If you god forbid got a confirmed hiv diagnosis Then you can try to figure out life after the diagnosis so don't worry about it now. ### Are you doing okay? ### What a thoughtful comment ❤️ ): I also have anxiety that I read the results wrong on the rapid - what if there was a super faint second line that meant I’m positive? Idk, I’m trying to just continue until I get the results from the blood work. It was/is still so scary though. I will look up Jennifer!! I think I’m nervous too bc I’m mostly straight and there’s not as much acceptance or knowledge in the straight community as the gay community. I really needed the support so thank you a lot for this comment. I truly appreciate your time and thoughtfulness ❣️ ### Thank you so so so much for reading and for your support ): I really appreciate your comment ### No reply means ok lol, people normally forgot about their freak outs after they found out the result is negative ### Thank you so much.

First of all, i want to implie that this post is not intended to offend anyone, just telling my story of anxiety. I was all ready been told that my risk for hiv is really low. I’m fully aware my symptoms most probably are not hiv, but anyway, i will test tomorrow, as the 90th day mark will reach, in order to clear my mind from uncertainty.

My situation is i had vaginal and oral sex (receptive oral) with a girl who i fear has HIV, i have my reasons for my fear, it’s not worth retelling. I used a condom for vaginal, but i didn’t used the condom 100% correctly. 

26 days (3.5 weeks) after the sex i took an only antibody blood from a vein 3rd generation test at a lab. It was negative.

12 weeks after this sex, i had a fever, headache, night sweats, that lasted for 24 hours. Went away after taking analgesics. Common sense told me that it might be another thing, i know that’s the most likely thing. But i just want to test at day 90 to clear my mind and chill after this stress.

Last week I had a slight fever and some weird symptoms. Does anyone know how easy it would be to contract HIV from this scenario?",6,2021-11-04 13:19:34-04:00,"Do you have any open wounds where the virus can enter your blood stream? 

Is she even positive? Where do you live? What is the prevalence of hiv in heterosexual women. 

There are like 5000 factors that play into the risk scenario here. ### None that I noticed

She said that she’s clean, a rural city & I would guess it’s a pretty low rate

The only thing that I find weird is that I almost fully recovered from a sickness last week and then this Tuesday I started feeling weird again. ### In regards to HIV - if you came into contact with someone who was positive, the risk of contracting it varies by the type of act. So I will go with the riskiest scenario here, which is receptive anal sex. The relative risk for this is 1.9% - and if the person was newly infected (first 6-12 weeks), which is when they are most infectious, the risk goes to 13%. 

[The risks for all other sexual acts fall dramatically below this.](https://www.aidsmap.com/about-hiv/estimated-hiv-risk-exposure) For an insertive male into a vagina the risk is 0.04% - not during a period.

I don’t know the stats for period sex. There are a lot of factors that would increase the risk - the biggest being, if she was positive, did she have a high viral load - low viral loads are unable to infect. Also, was there a way for the virus to enter your bloodstream…? 

**A little education for you while we are on the topic**, if the Person with HIV is on medication and has an undetectable viral load, even when condoms are not used used this risk goes down to [zero](https://www.catie.ca/en/positiveside/summer-2017/uu) (known as U=U or treatment as prevention and is backed by the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/art/index.html), the [NIH](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/science-clear-hiv-undetectable-equals-untransmittable), [UNAIDS](https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/featurestories/2018/july/undetectable-untransmittable) and many other organizations based on data from the [PARTNER](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)30418-0/fulltext) & [PARTNER2](https://www.aidsmap.com/news/jul-2018/zero-transmissions-mean-zero-risk-partner-2-study-results-announced) studies.) This also significantly lowers the chance of transferring HIV through childbirth (to zero with proper adherence to meds). ### It seems that your comment contains 1 or more links that are hard to tap for mobile users.

I highly doubt that she’s positive since she does regular checkups. 

I’m probably just overthinking & causing stress/anxiety related symptoms to show up. Thank you for all that information, it’s helped me calm down a bit😅 I’ll still get tested when it hits 6 weeks just in case ### I mean - regular checkups usually don’t included hiv outside the lgbtq community. So even if she is being tested, hiv may not be included. 

I was positive for 2 years without knowing and I thought I was being tested for everything every 3 months when I got my birth control. But I learned later that hiv wasn’t included - so be careful with that. It usually needs to be specifically requested. 

You can really never know someone’s status, and many people are uneducated, so it’s important to be vigilant with your own testing as well. 

That being said - the stats are on your side. As an insertive male you’re the second lowest risk category after lesbians. During those two years I was positive I had sex with my partner multiple times and he never contracted hiv. ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIV/comments/qmpm2e/hiv_from_unprotected_period_sex/

I'm a male aged 21 

I had unprotected sex with a man and a woman at the beginning of September( first week). I did not engage in any anal sex but oral and vaginal sex did happen, I gave oral to both the man and the woman and I did have a sore in my mouth. Fast forward to the end of November. I started having pain on my urethra and I checked with a doctor. My blood test and urine tests were conducted and nothing came in it but I was diagnosed with non-gonococcal Urethritis. I have noticed white tounge way before my urethritis started. And now I have lymph node swollen on my left neck just down my ear lobes. I know it was a dumb thing to do and I was pretty drunk then. I'm just losing my mind, so I would want to know if I should test now for hiv and would it show any result if I do it now. Or if I should wait. Also I get fatigued pretty easily. Even if I walk a little bit on a steep slope.

Also since I'm really uneducated about this, I would like to know if I'm at a high risk to get something like HIV.

6 months is meant for people who are immunosuppressed, or under going a chemotherapy or having hepatitis C and severely ill from it. But normal people start developing this antibodies at most ""4 weeks"" from infection. Infact 95% on an average produce antibodies at the 4th week.. And by the 12th week Mark over 99.9 have enough Antibodies to test positive.  Therefore, if you test for hiv with a 3rd generation Antibody rapid test (blood finger prick type to be specific) and it came out Negative then you are NEGATIVE. This is the current guideline by even the most conversative hiv organisation. Infact even if you were on PEP, the guidelines suggests 12 weeks from exposure day to get tested and close it up that you are negative.
Do not allow people with extreme phobia and guidelines ignorance to emotionally traumatise you with their unfounded Opinions. 
If you test at 6 weeks mark and it's Negative then you are most likely to be negative,  and the 12th week mark test will confirm this for you.

If that was the case then the CDC would advise that the window is 6 mths. You think such a conservative organization would throw caution to the wind if numerous people were testing positive after 6 mths?

It used to be 6 mths not because people took 6 mths to produce antibodies but because the testing technology wasn’t great and it took longer for the tests to react to already present antibodies. But this was in the late 90’s. 

Most tests are accurate by 4 weeks and certainly by 6 weeks. 6 mths is about 25 years late for advice. ### Old news ### Yeah I've tested since may all negative my last test was in September  but was told I need to wait to test at 6 months ### I was also to a 4th gen is better tho!

I have genital herpes kind 1 but no outbreak currently. I read online that once you have a herpes outbreak, the way your skin heals make you more prone to contracting HIV. I am really freaking out and worried about this encounter. I know its low risk but I am worried what if some blood his mucous from some mouth cut got on my skin while deep throating. I did not kiss him or perform any oral sex on him and kept my condom on all the time during anal sex. I also fingered him. 

I went to hospital to get PEP and they gave me 3 day supply with a prescription. Its really expensive though. $200 even after my insurance covers part of it. I am not sure if its worth going on PEP. I have until tomorrow to decide cause tomorrow is my last dose from hospital then I'll have to pay to get it. Also pep can cause liver damage rarely. 

What do you guys think? Shpuld I be worried? Should I continue pep or its not needed? Do you know anyone who got it from oral?

Good luck. ### You used a condom. Unless that condom broke or was misused then you are at no real risk. And as for oral sex the risk is negligible. If he’s on prep he won’t have hiv anyway.

qhmvtf,"Scared, iLL and not sure what is going to happen. This week I find out what is wrong with me.

I’ve had pretty much all acute HIV Symptoms still testing negative after exposure.

I had insertive anal sex where condom may have broke with a trans lady.

I have tested at 4 weeks, 7 weeks and 10 weeks all negative and with home sampling. Which I believe would be 3rd gen using a finger prick. And then another at 80 days 3rd gen which was blood drawn from vein.

I have even had an antigen and antibody test at 65 days also negative.


I have had a fever for 2 months, I had very painful neck lymph nodes. Have a burning sensation in forearms. I have persistent diarrhea and oral thrush. Tinnitus. bruising easily and way more. Fatigue. Muscle Aches. Just general discomfort and feeling of burning on my arms. Droopy eyes. Headaches

90 days on I am still feeling extremely unwell. Nothing psychosomatic. Whole body has felt like it’s burning.

I’ve never physically felt like this before and I know the odds are low given the tests I’ve done but it seems highly unlikely I pick up a rare condition off the back of my exposure that mirrors HIV for the first time.

I have now went to my GP which I was avoiding as I can be diagnosed without him. This is the worst setting that I could find out personally and he drew lots of blood for different tests. He seemed fairly concerned with my symptoms.

I have read so many accounts where people have said they feel symptoms and never test positive but I will find out this week.

Your support would be greatly appreciated thanks. 😊,2,2021-10-26 00:18:20-04:00,"I took PEP about a year ago after I had unprotected sex with a guy I had been talking to online. It wasn’t my intention to have sex without protection but in the moment I did what I did. Needless to say, I regretted it and subsequently went to urgent care to be screened for stds and get on PEP. I was given a prescription and was on it I’d say maybe 4-5 hours after potential exposure. While I was happy to have acted preemptively, that optimism quickly faded as I began to feel symptoms related to the medication. I felt very nauseous and lethargic. Most days I was exhausted and just wanted to lay in bed. The nauseousness was really difficult to deal with and the constant stomach aches made the experience uncomfortable. Overall though I would do it all over again (taking PEP, not having bareback sex). It was an eye opening experience and though I had considered taking PrEP, this experience made me feel like it wasn’t for me. I would endeavor to be safer and more selective about my sexual exploits. Thankfully, I’ve stuck to that.

If you’re asking because you’re considering taking it, I would say to do it. It may be unpleasant for the next month but it won’t be anything that will severely impact your ability to function day to day. Not to mention the fact that it can significantly reduce the chance of seroconversion. Also, time in this case truly is of the greatest importance. The closer to potential exposure that PEP is taken, the higher the chance that it will help potential conversion if you have in fact been exposed to HIV. ### Thanks very helpful.

Hiv patient can marry to anyone and they have plan to baby 👶 but patient should be there in medicine. 

One more thing hiv is undetectable = untransmittable

About your question.... Definitely we will get medicine or vaccine for hiv. 

Always think positive.... Everything is possible in the world ### Will it ever be curable ### Well as an HIV positive person I hope so. However I really hope it gets fully preventeable before. To avoid further infections and stop this pandemic.

Currently there are trials ongoing for a mRNA vaccine to prevent it. Which is already a huge step forward to end this. If no one else can get it and if we can erradicate it, there is not a real need for a cure so urgently.

Regarding a Cure, once again you can read about progress on google. But apart from *antiretroviral treatment (ARV)* the cure seems to be a little bit far away yet.

HIV is really good hiding on the human body, that ends up being a plus to achieve the Undetectable and Untransmissable state, however makes it really hard to fully cure. I believe that the number of mutations that the virus suffers through a lifetime also increase difficulty of this scenario. (i am not a doctor, please feel free to correct me or add to this statement)

So as per the title, I got a home test kit from [sh.co.uk](https://sh.co.uk/) and sent it back Monday. I got a call today from a nurse saying my urine/anal/mouth samples came back ok, but that with my blood sample ""the flags for HIV and Hep B are slightly higher than the cut off"" and when logging into my account my HIV test shows as ""Low reactive""

I'm absolutely petrified.

She says its quite normal, and that 99% of the time after a retest its all clear and that i'm the 6th person she had called that morning to say the same thing too. I have to go into a clinic tomorrow for a proper blood sample.

After some googling, my understanding of a ""low reactive"" result is that I've basically tested positive for HIV, but that they want another sample to confirm before they tell me :-(

I feel like my world is crashing down around me and Im shaking just trying to type this.

I keep telling my self how I would have got HIV??

I had another experience a week or so prior to that which was just a normal handjob.

I did have anal in June. I wore a condom, and there was 0 touching before hand, I inserted myself into the other guy and was in there for maybe a minute before stopping. The condom did not break, and I took it off without letting it touch me before washing my hands and then my penis. The guy also said he only does things with condoms, and he had a large supply so believe him.

But I got a test just over 4 weeks after that which was all negative.

Just on here to see if anyones been through anything similar or can reassure me?

Thank you :-(

""High reactive result: Specimens with reactivity above the Predictive Cut-Off Index (PCOI) of 50 (4th gen assay) or 10 (5th gen assay).

You wore a condom in the anal so again - no risk there. I’m very VERY sure you will be negative, but it must be a horribly stressful time for you. When can you retest? ### Thank you so much, I have the retest booked for tomorrow, but they said 5 - 7 days for the results :-(

I havent slept and feel physically sick all the time, all whilst pretending to be my happy smiling self to family, friends and at work. The thought of having to wait another week for the results I feel will literally kill me.

Im so stressed, panicked and anxious that I cant think straight. The nurse did say I was slightly above the cut off point that pushed my results to be a ""low reactive"". But her being so calm just makes me interpret what she's saying as the worst. Everthing I read online basically says I have HIV, and this other test is just to confirm it??? ### I think it’s the opposite - the other test will confirm you don’t have it. I really am sure you’ll be ok, but the waiting is horrendous. I really do understand the extreme anxiety but even if (worse case scenario) you do have it (which you don’t) life will continue. You will just take one pill a day and you can don’t have to disclose to family and friends if you don’t want to. And there will be a cure Very soon - in the next few years, in quite sure of it.

But just wait it out, you will be negative and then you can put this behind you. Have you thought about going on PReP to further lower your chances of ever getting it? ### Thank you again for your reassurance!

My circumstances are a little more complicated, so me testing positive wouldn't just effect my life. If it was just me I wouldn't be nearly as worried.

I'll let you know how I get on tomorrow :-) ### So then I guess you are married or in a rel (maybe with a woman)? No judgement here but  if you want to keep getting with guys then this extreme std stress is always gonna be with you - so you need to figure out a solution of some sort and a definite way to protect your partner. All the best for today. ### Yes married. Been with the wife since we were 18, now in our 40's! Always been bi but never told anyone or tried it.

Hit 40 and had a mid life crisis thinking Im never going to experience it. Hence whats happened this year and the pickle I now find myself in :-(

I wont be doing it again. tried it as I planned to, now I'm done and this scare has made sure of that.

Thank you for your help, I'm currently sat outside the clinic waiting ### Sorry for the late update. Got a call from the clinic on Thursday, test is negative!

Everywhere you read it says that a faint line is a positive. Everywhere. Starting in the HIV test instructions / box.

Please do not say this to people. ### I posted all the pictures just swipe to see ### listen to this really carefully. Stop trying to find a fucking ""no, it's a false positive"". You have HIV. 

There's only really low possibilities of a false positive. Really low possibilities. Do not act or think like that. 

Go to a clinic and take the test with you. The blood works they will do on you will be confirmatory and conclusive. Move. ### You are a very rare case. I'm not rude. Ask around. False hope is worth than early acceptance. She needs to go have a conclusive test and not pats on her back. ### [deleted] ### This is a positive test.

You need a confirmatory test. ### First of all, no one will die from HIV in this day and age. What is your gender? What is your partner's gender? What was the nature of your exposure? When was your exposure?

Home tests give many false positive results. ### It's why I said could be false positive or true positive. Just retest with another test not oralquick ### What state do you reside in? Has there been bad batches of tests? ### But she is scared and let's be sympathetic,I wouldn't Wana see this and rite now I myself am in a waiting period. ### If the line is not full my doctor told me its suspicious for being positive but not 100 % ### Stop posting and go to a clinic. You need a confirmatory test. That is the regular procedure / protocol. Please move. :)

Dont take my messages as insultive, but **since your test says that you have HIV** the sooner you act against it the sooner you will get medication against it.

I have been diagnosed 2 years ago. I am undetectable and untransmissable for over 18 months. Please move. You will not going to die, you will not be in pain.

You will cry a river but do that **after you have the confirmatory tests**.

Finger prick tests usually have an accuracy of 95%. For your own good, stop doubting science and go check your **Viral Load.** That is the only way to be 100% sure and the only way to start your treatment.

The thin line might simply mean that you are not that reactive, therefore the infection is brand new. This is just a ""*might*"". Do not grab that hope about *not having it* it will absolutely destroy you once you run out of ""*mights"".*  Trust me... I have been there.

Now seriously get out of reddit, go get a confirmatory blood work to the nearest clinic and then we are all here to talk to you regarding *what's life going to be with HIV.*. (which is perfectly normal by the way. We love, we live, we work, we fuck.)

This is **not me being rude.** This is me being pragmatic. ### Rude ! ### Noone has told her she doesn't need to have a conclusive test but if you asked the right questions you'd know they were faulty test results. I got in touch with her and she told me those results were after the allotted 20 minute wait time. And in that case YES that is a false positive result. I know because I bought loads ov them when I was going through my hiv scare. Anything over 20 minutes would cause the test stick to over develop. She needs a conclusive test regardless but to tell her she is positive 100% is irresponsible ### RNA !? ### I’m 33 female . My husband is 31 he tested negative ### I’m think maybe 1.5 years ago ### Ugh … I’m so scared :/ ### for fuck sake. **stop**! She needs a blood work as confirmation and not a crystal ball!

**Stop giving advise like this on a tab as important as this one.** ### Tennessee ### The parent answer is ridiculous and defies science. So does yours. Read from people that bypassed the waiting game some years ago. **A THIN LINE IS A POSITIVE.** It says in the box. A faulty test would have a thin CONTROL LINE, not the reactive. ### **This is wrong. Absolutely wrong.**

A thin line in the reactive line means absolutely that. A thin reaction. Might be for many reasons as humans react to HIV differently.

If the control line is strong, the test is accurate and the answer is there. She is HIV positive with 95% accuracy and she needs blood work to confirm the viral load, resistance and start treatment ASAP.

**Stop advising people here with that type of inputs. It may destroy lives.**

&#x200B;

*If she is negative, we all celebrate later. For now lets act fucking responsibly, shall we? Stop spreading misinformation.* ### Rude but real and hiv positive. Do not think you do not have it. Unfortunately you do. Act about it. The ones patting on your back saying that it can be a false positive are contributing for a false hope.

Please go to a clinic, if possible today! ### > if you asked the right questions you'd know they were faulty test results

I respect your insight. This is not a playground. She had a *false positive* as **you** call it... It might not be false at all!!! And **you know it!!!** There is no way you can achieve that statment without proper scientific proof!! You can call it whatever you want. The right protocol is to follow up with a blood work... As you certainly know it. Reddit is not a reliable source, internet is not a reliable source. She needs blood work with a conclusive test and then she can have her peace or deal with it (and achieve her peace after.)

If you are HIV+ you will understand my words and cold blood. This is not a joke. We can make people sick without treatment. there's  no room for margin of error.

Please use this 340 members tab to spread **good information.** We do not care for feelings as much as we care to stop this fucking pandemic. 

Cheers. ### Are you pregnant? Listen, these rapid tests are useless. You need to do the blood work. Ask for the 4th generation ab/ag blood draw. ### Dm me ### It’s a valid question. ### Yes I understand your thinking but showing a little bit of sympathy won't kill you.just imagine getting that results. ### So basically I’ll die ### Once again you seem to be conveniently reading what you want. I said she needs a blood test regardless. But once again you telling someone without a doubt unequivocally that they are HIV positive and I just think that is incredibly irresponsible when most ov the people on this are panicking over results or fear to even get tested to begin with. Never did I say she did not need a 4th Gen test. You just keep imagining things. ### Yes I’m pregnant . I don’t understand how my husband can be negative but myself positive ### I tried it won’t let me ### Tennessee ### With all due respect, '*a little of symphaty*' is **not what she needs** and what she needs is what I will give her here. I had the same doubts. What you and others are doing **is not helpful.** This isnt a support group (*only*) this is an informational tab. ***Stop spreading fake hope and start spreading ACCURATE information.***

And the most accurate information is:

*If the control line is strong, does not matter the thickness of the test line. If there is reaction there is around 95% chances that she has HIV. After a reactive test the patient needs to seek a clinic and get their blood tested for Viral Load*. *This is the only way.*

Here, take it, memorize it, so you dont spread the same bullshit on the next call. ### You felt aweful and horrible and stuff and all u needed is someone to hug you and say you gona be ok.just a little sympathy.i know almost majority of people here is scared shitless and ends up being negative and u prob tired of assuring people of this and reading the same shit ,like me ,had a blood draw and thinks I prob got HIV from it but yet at week 5 still testing negative.avtually went on pep because of how scared I was.nway just a little bit of ""hey it's gona be ok"" will really go a long way ### No you are not going to die. Im not going to give you the attention u seek until you come from the clinic with a blood work confirmation test.

You will be just fine. But now stop freaking out and talking with strangers on reddit and go to a clinic. The sooner you do that the less dangerous hiv will become. ### Don't take everything this inconsiderate imbecile is telling you. Those aren't good results as I'm sure you well know. Get this followed up with a blood test and only then will it be conclusive. ### Is it more irresponsible than telling someone to **that they are most likely fine?**

I don't want to rant on you. But HIV is not a fucking game.Please refrain yourself from telling people that *it is ok* without a proper scientific confirmation on their hands.

Cheers.

  
EDIT: Your entire comment is based on your personal (and rare) case. Get a grip of reality. ### Pregnancy cause false positive even on the 4th generation ab/ag blood draw. Do you have a doctor? Pregnant women test false positive on HIV tests all the time. ### I did ### I would hate to ask what you think about my exposure.
Yes I get ur get real approach and yes being real rite now is what she needs bit send her hugs. ### **PEP after 5 weeks does absolutely nothing**. You have absolutely NO IDEA on what you are talking about. Leave this sub. You are NOT welcome in here with that pseudo science.

PEP needs to be started within 72h of exposure otherwise **it simply does not work.** Again, leave this sub. You are not welcome here. Go read. Come back once you have some real information to spread instead of that bullshit. ### Just so scared ### Once again you refuse to acknowledge that I've also recommended proper protocol for diagnosis. You're either intellectually deficient or you're just doing it on purpose. Even you are trying to diagnose someone online and stating that a 49 dollar over the counter saliva swab is more conclusive than blood. Try and take your own an advice and get a grip ov your own reality. Go read some books or something ### Yes I do haven’t been tested yet . I go on Monday . If they test me ### How do you know all this ? ### I am HIV positive. I **KNOW** what she is going through. That fake hope leads to way worse outcome than facing the facts and accepting her status *after* a confirmation test that needs to be done **right now**. ### Ok wait I think u are getting seriously confused .I took pep after 22 hours after my exposure.u being seriously rude .and no u read.who in the hell takes pep after 5 weeks ,are u insane .omw u really are a angry person. ### If you have the money, you could try the test again. I've had so many ov those turn out false positive. Can I ask you how long it was after you took the test that you took a picture ov it? The timing is very fickle ### You are just fully retarded :) ### Look I get what u saying and rite now I kinda needed your kinda approach ,at least she isn't in the waiting game and can plan her life around being proactive rite ,I envy people out of the waiting game .it's fucking horrendous. ### A little over 20 mins ### Haha sure. If I am then you must have cerebral palsy as well as HIV ### Nobody dies from HIV in 2021. Take it easy. The moment of pat in the back comes with her self acceptance. Until a confirmation we need to pass the **strength and responsibility.**

In your case, take it also easy. Again, nobody dies from HIV in 2021. :)

Im on this tab for long to know when someone needs a comfort or a shock to wake up. And she needs a shock to wake up. Not a pat in the back saying that ""maybe its negative"". Because theres only around 5% chances of that being a truth.

Take care my friend. Rooting for you. But if the waiting game ends wrong, you will still be fine, happy and live a long and healthy life. ### Okay so the ideal time to wait is exactly twenty minutes. Once you get the result toss it. Because if you hold onto the test stick, it can over develop and appear positive. ### If it was over 20 minutes there's a good chance it was over developed. How long would you say? 30 minutes? ### Thank you ,maybe u not a rude or angry person 🤭 u actually sound cool ,IL maybe hit ur dms up.much love from me tho.❤️ ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/qd8a3z

Already waiting results on a test but I’ve been an anxious mess for a few days now. To the point where I’m thinking every little thing that could be associated with the anxiety I’m thinking is associated with HIV...which is making everything worse...

32/m - This past weekend I randomly saw a small amount of discharge down there. Now this was weird because I haven’t been sexually active in months (last time was the first week of September). And all of my partners have been known HIV negative for years (people I very much trust and have known for years, not just randoms). I did an oraquick test but it was a defective test. Since I needed to be seen for the discharge anyways, I figured I’d just get a work up done while I was there.

Combine this with the fact that I just got over a bout of potential COVID in August, followed by an a cold the past week/week and a half, and now I’m freaking out thinking I’ve had this for years and never known. And I mean YEARS. Potentially up to 6+ years.

I never got tested because I rarely put myself in “risky” situations. I’m not saying I was perfect, and I know I SHOULD have been tested much sooner, but I’ve only engaged in sex with another male twice, both times fully protected, and every other time has been with a female, mostly women I knew were not HIV-positive

I did engage in unprotected sex with random females during my college years, but they assured me they were STD free, and it wasn’t often (I can only think of maybe 4 encounters total?). Statistically speaking, I realize it would have been very, very difficult to even encounter a woman with HIV to begin with, much less contract it from her.

I did have some kind of NGU back then as well, which was treated by antibiotics and cleared within a couple days. The doc I saw back then wasn’t super concerned about many STD’s given the information I gave, but obviously gave me some information on gon and chlamydia, did a culture that turned up positive for an infection, gave me some antibiotics and sent me on my way. 

However, I’m not seeing much progress this time around from the antibiotics I was given. It’s only been a couple days, and I see that it could sometimes take up to a week or more, but it’s still unsettling to me. 

None of the trusted partners I had in the past 6+ years have contacted me about contracting any STD at all, much less HIV, so I believe that also might be a point in my favor but, also, just never know.

The clinic I went to this time recommended a full std work up, which from what he told and I understand is common practice, he did a physical examination of my hands and feet, no abnormalities, once again gave me antibiotics, and then sent me on my way. Said they’d call me within 4-6 days with results.

Since my last sexual encounter, I’ve had covid and a cold, both of which have subsided. Some other symptoms I’m experiencing now:

\-loose stools (could be from anxiety)

\-dry cough/coughing up phlegm (also just getting over a cold, also I have allergies)

\-occasional shortness of breath (also probably from anxiety)

\-“rash” on my face (I have dry skin on/around my nose, have had it for years, and I didn’t keep up with lotion/washing my face over the weekend so it’s noticeable at the moment)

\-loss of appetite, but I’m still eating normal proportions (also could be anxiety related, and because I’m still eating without the appetitie, could be contributing to loose stools)

I have not been feverish, have not had much fatigue (other than maybe from lack of sleep with all this keeping me awake), no swollen nodes, not losing weight, no random sores, just in general not “sick” at the moment from what I can tell.

The only other cause for the discharge I can think of is I happen to have a resistant strain of an NGU bacteria like MG, and so it just now decided to present itself over the weekend. Would also explain the lack of progress on treatment.

I’m also thinking that if this was some kind of late stage HIV, that I wouldn’t be getting over two completely separate sicknesses in relatively normal timeframes.

I guess another question I have (if you’ve made it this far lol) is if anyone has had experience with recurring NGU, and what that experience was like.

If you made it down here to the end, thank you.

You’re worrying that your symptoms could be seroconversion - eg when the body starts producing hiv antibodies - it normally results in flu like symptoms. But it wouldn’t make sense for you both to get that at same time, considering the timelines and previous sexual partners you’ve outlined - cos he would have had it for 2 years. It’s most probably therefore something else - some run-of-the-mill virus. Chances for you as a top would only be 0.11% chance of getting it even if he did have it. Having said that, having unprotected anal sex is never a great idea. Please get on prep if you’re planning to do that regularly - or use condoms religiously. ### Y’all are both probably fine…get tested 6 weeks post possible exposure with a 4th gen test…take care and keep us posted ### My advice would be to get tested as soon as possible. Remember that HIV transmission isn't exclusive of unprotected sex. 

Also, bear in mind that HIV transmission rates are low: 1.4% for bottoming, and 0.11% for topping. Still two times would be low (0.22%).

Most probably is another virus, maybe a seasonal one since we're approaching winter. ### How can we know? We have no crystal ball. Not even doctors diagnose based on symptoms.

And what are the chances that it's not just some flu if we both got sick same day? ### Thank you for understanding what I meant.

Let me break it down really easily. The most risky behavior is receptive anal sex. Many other sexual practices also represent a (very small) risk of infection. That being said, male homosexual partners have an increased risk factor for that very same reason.

Sharing incertive toys or acessories might also increase this risk for the reason stated above. 

For a better projection, the official statistics say that for a male to contract HIV through sex with an infected female partner represent only 0.04% of risk.

[https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/overview/about-hiv-and-aids/how-is-hiv-transmitted](https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/overview/about-hiv-and-aids/how-is-hiv-transmitted) 

Combine that reading above with a research on your own about statistics regarding specific practices. 

Remember that 0.04% is not 0.00%. It is still 1 in 2500 cases.

I hope this breaks it down for you in a very simplistic way and I hope you do some digging on your own since you seem to be interested in this.

If you did have a risky behavior please test yourself after 8 weeks of the possible exposure. ### Here’s some info about how it’s spread sexually : 

To put the risk of getting HIV into perspective and spread a little awareness here, receptive anal sex is the riskiest sexual act with a relative risk of 1.9% per encounter when having anal intercourse with someone with *unmanaged* HIV. [The risks for all other sexual acts fall dramatically below this.](https://www.aidsmap.com/about-hiv/estimated-hiv-risk-exposure) Add a properly used condom into the equation, and this % goes down to zero. (Latex and polyurethane condoms are highly effective in preventing HIV)

HIV is actually a very weak virus that actually isn’t as infectious as we have been told - it needs an alignment of specific things in order for infection to occur.

**However**, if the Person with HIV is on medication and has an undetectable viral load, even when condoms are not used used this risk goes down to [zero](https://www.catie.ca/en/positiveside/summer-2017/uu) (known as U=U or treatment as prevention and is backed by the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/art/index.html), the [NIH](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/science-clear-hiv-undetectable-equals-untransmittable), [UNAIDS](https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/featurestories/2018/july/undetectable-untransmittable) and many other organizations based on data from the [PARTNER](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)30418-0/fulltext) & [PARTNER2](https://www.aidsmap.com/news/jul-2018/zero-transmissions-mean-zero-risk-partner-2-study-results-announced) studies.) This also significantly lowers the chance of transferring HIV through childbirth (to zero with proper adherence to meds).

A fun fact, it’s actually riskier to be with someone who doesn’t know their status then it is to be with someone who had been diagnosed and is on medication. The majority of new infections actually come from people who think they are ‘clean’ as they are most infectious in the weeks after infection while the viral load spikes -
the virus also won’t show up on tests during this time - so this is where the most risk comes in. After this, the viral load actually drops down and enters a latency stage that can last for years and the virus becomes far less infectious. 

Hit up [The World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids) for more info on transmission. ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIV/comments/q9i735/got_a_question_about_hiv_and_same_sex/

Be patient, think about good things. Everything will be OK **even** if you do have HIV.I would place the odds on the low now... Seriously.

The most risky behavior out there is receptive anal sex. If you had someone with HIV and untreated ganking you bareback then you have a higher risk of infection by HIV, in any other case your odds are most likely below 1% of contracting HIV from a **untreated** **HIV+** individual. If you were not exposed to a HIV+ individual there is absolutely **no chance** on contracting HIV. It does not appear out of thin air.

Deal with that chlamydia, must be really uncomfortable and it might create long term damage if not dealt with properly.

In your shoes, I would contact - even if anonymously - my recent sex partners to advise them to get tested for STDs and STIs as well.

Take care. ### For what it's worth HIV is pretty hard to transmit. You could have sex with someone with HIV multiple times and not turn out positive. Try and rest easy til you get your results and try not to look too much into it online. Self diagnosing can cause a lot ov harm and stress. Best ov luck to you❤️ ### You’re probably fine; chlamydia spreads easier than hiv. Take care next time! ### HIV isn’t prevalent amongst female bisexuals. The risk comes in with anal sex - so them being bisexual doesn’t increase your risk. If they were men; it would. Just because they are a part of the lgbtq community doesn’t automatically make them more dangerous - that’s not how infection works. 

A female passing hiv to a male is near impossible. 0.04% for an unprotected vaginal encounter and 0.11% for anal. ### He is most likely negative. But I do appreciate your warm comment.  
He will indeed be OK doesn't matter what.

Cheers. ### 
>You’re probably fine; chlamydia spreads easier than hiv. Take care next time!

This. ### Yeah thanks for the information, I read articles stating that bisexual women were more likely to have it because men are less likely to get tested. But you’re probably right, And sorry if I came across as bigoted that wasn’t my intention ### Well then, that’s just women in general - not bisexual women. And women that partake in anal sex are at a much higher risk (1.9% as opposed to 0.08% for vaginal)

The statement of men not getting tested is true - there have been multiple studies that have found men don’t get tested until they have a partner who comes back positive as they feel it seems less masculine to get tested.

Still… a female transmitting hiv to a male is nearly impossible.

And not bigoted - most of the world is uneducated. I wasn’t trying to be rude, just educate on the matter - people seem to think that because someone is lgbtq aids just magically manifests itself in them. ### ",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIV/comments/q90tqk/got_tested_recently_and_im_so_scared/

You already have it - so 100% -‘or 0% depending how you look at it. ### what is it that you're scared of? hiv or herpes? its best not to make out with sores because well I mean gross but like there has only been one case reported in HISTORY of deep kissing of two partners with actively bleeding gums and even that is not for sure. ### Well with herpes it might complicate things but honestly its probably just a cold. But definitely get checked for HIV ### HIV is not spread through kissing. It is spread by having unprotected sex, mother to baby by pregnancy, and sharing blood products (needles, etc.). The chance that you caught HIV by kissing is very low, but it’s always good practice to get tested after having unprotected sex. You’re probably just sick with a cold/flu so make sure you get tested. ### Although very rare, transmission can occur if both partners have sores or bleeding gums and blood from the partner with HIV gets into the bloodstream of the HIV-negative partner. ### I think he is scared of hiv because of the sores... ### I see. I didn't have any mouth sores, as far as I know. ### HIV spreading through herpes that magically travelled from the genitals to The mouth? ### I'm a girl and yes I meant hiv ### girl you have nothing to worry about. if we were all worried about every kiss we give anyone, we'd eventually die lonely and single and the human population would go extinct ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIV/comments/q6zd1d/what_are_the_odds/
q6tjtp,"Curious about the % of getting HIv So because I had an (maybe risky) encounter I wonder how the time of the act modifies the % of getting HIV.

For example: Insertive anal sex (when bottom is HIV+ and untreated) has a chance of 0.11% to transmit HIV to the insertive person. How long is a single encounter for it to be 0.11%?

How does a 5 minutes act and a 30 minutes act change the probability of getting HIV?

I guess 30 minutes of anal sex can't be the same chance as 5 minutes of anal sex.

Does anyone know?",23,2021-10-12 15:20:18-04:00,"Good question! (And sorry I have no idea). u/crumblingbees do you know? ### I think it doesn’t matter. As soon as you touch bodily fluids you “exchange” those fluids. I had a risk encounter and have been researching like hell! This is only my opinion from my research. ### That's a really good question. I don't really know the answer, however, the longer the time of the exposure, the greater the chance of transmission. Like any other virus, a certain concentration or inoculum is needed. For example, pre-ejaculatory fluid is released from the male urethra in amounts of up to 4 ml during sexual arousal, prior to ejaculation. ### When was the encounter? I have been researching a lot too and I haven't found anything about that. ### I also think it doesn't matter, it is overall 1 exposure and the overall chance is 0.11%. ### My encounter was 13 days ago. And the overall thing was about 7-10 min or so. ### And are you calm? Cuz I’m freaking out as soon as I’m alone 😅 ### Heck no! I am freaking out pretty much every day. I have work to distract me, but I freak out when I free time to think lol ### I took two tests and they came back negative but that was at 7 days so I know they were a waste of time.

Try not to think about it, you’re not alone. ### Tough part is that I’m feeling weird symptoms and I don’t know if it’s because of anxiety or if there’s real symptoms ### Most people have that, even after they tested negative. Anxiety makes you sick. Don’t look for illnesses that aren’t there. ### What are you feeling? I had a risky encounter about a month ago, i got oral without a condom but had anal sex with a condom, and on monday i started feeling sick, yesterday i was in bed all day and today i feel better. But i scheduled a hiv test for tomorrow ### Yeah I’m tryna not to. Definitely tough. I’m going to hopefully wait until next Thursday (21 days) and get another test. I know it takes 3 mo but I need some sort of reprieve lol ### Just sore body. Weird feeling in urethra something like a pain. I had unprotected oral and insertive sex so it’s scary. I was told before inserting that I have nothing to worry about. And via text. But why am I feeling like this 😢 ### hey, you have had barely any risk, so your test will be negative.

q6lbix,"pep and testing Hi
I am currently on pep and on my 27th day I took a HIV test,normal rapid just to ease my mind and it came back negative.
My exposure was I had a blood draw and I was scared that I may have been exposed to HIV blood that the nurse wasn't aware of and just to be safe I got the pep tabs and started taking it about 22 hours after they drew my blood.
The needle was clean but there was a white tube involved in drawing the blood that I wasn't sure of if it was clean.
What I Wana know is if I can put any hope in my latest result .
I am currently 2 days away from completing my meds.
Yes I know guys that alot of people will say I had no exposure but this is so real for me.
I don't have sex at all!!!!!!!
I don't so drugs 
Can I put some hope in my results I got so far",11,2021-10-12 08:42:54-04:00,"I'm super shocked that they prescribed you pep for this. This is more like ocd which trust me I understand more than anyone but if you give in to such negligible risks for pep, you're gonna be taking pep for everything every second of the day. As someone who has battled with hiv odd after a traumatic event let me tell you it doesn't get better unless you don't do such huge compulsions. As far as testing its recommended to test 4 month after exposure 3 month after finishing pep if you actually have a high risk exposure. ### get psychiatric help.  yr suffering from hiv hysteria and wasting thousands of dollars of medicine for no reason.  you didn't qualify for pep and it's absurd that any idiot healthcare worker gave it to you.  

this wasn't an exposure at all.  this is ridiculous.

what you need is psychiatric help. ### Well, it's a very good sign that your test came back negative. At 28 days, a 4th gen test will be 95% accurate, at 6 weeks, 99%, and at 3 mo, 99.97% accurate. I'd like to share some info regarding PEP of a Nature Review (2015, doi:10.1038/nrdp.2015.35): ""Since 1999, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has identified only one confirmed case of occupationally acquired HIV infection, probably reflecting the efficacy of post-exposure prophylaxis. ### Yip this is my second time on pep actually ,I was raped after then I took pep,and after that it was a spiral of tests all the time , just afraid and when they gave me pep I said I had unprotected sex ,I couldn't tell them the truth as they would never give me pep.so now I'm just in my limbo mode and waiting for my dates to get tested ### Yeah ocd for sure lol.. sorry to giggle but its def over the top to be scared of contaminated blood in a hospital. Maybe back in the early 80s before we knew what hiv aids was. But not now. Another thing.... i was told by an hiv specialist if u test 2 weeks after possible exposure, if its negative, chances are itll stay negative as long as theres no further instances of exposure. Really, at about 10 days you can test and if its negative more times than not, thats what you are, negative.... this shit about testing up to 4 months later .. i mean is it possible, yes but so unlikely ### Yip I'd be happy to hear🙏 ### I'm SO sorry for what you've gone through, you're not alone. PTSD can really fuck up your mind and some how start a series of ocd and phobia regarding certain topics specially stds. You already might logically be aware that you didn't have a risk by getting your blood drawn so moving forward please don't give into the compulsion. It can literally become life altering and you get to a point you can't even leave the house. please see someone for PTSD. ### Even if on pep? I have tested so many times since I was on pep and all negative ,and I'm done now with pep and gona have my next test next week so yip up until my 29th day I am still negative.just scared the pep didn't work coz I feel iffy.thamk you for making me feel better. ### What is so frustrating now is that for a month I put myself on pep when it wasn't needed at all,that's so hurtful by my own doing ,it's so sad .in my mind I know that but then I go to the other side which is telling me hey u have it l.ive discussed this with so many people and they all agree that having my blood drawn is in no way a risk not even low risk ,it's a zero risk but yet I have this fear where I cudve got it.i don't go anywhere but work and home and only to shops because my kids need to eat but other than that I stay home to prevent people from infecting me in many scenarios I have replayed in my mind .it's stupid but yet I can't shake it.my boyfriend suffers to I mean since last year we haven't slept together ,and then my mind will go hey he is gona cheat and then sleep with someone and give me hiv ,it's just a circle of crap that never ends .I just can't be happy ### Again I'm so sorry for what you went through BIG HUGS.

first of all, there is NO risk with blood draws like none. Thats everyone's ocd trigger cause it has needles but I can assure you there us mechanisms automatically on blood draw devices that reassures they can not be reused. Also a freak thing like this happened in the 90s (before the safety mechanism) and even with that and 100s being exposed no one picked up a single infection.

now regarding the intrusive thoughts, it's gonna take some hard work and the only way to save yourself from this is to not give a shit. the more bigger compulsions you do the more ridiculous your ocd is gonna become. Life is so short is it worth lowering your quality of life for something that has such a low risk of happening? Your chance of dying in an accident is 1 in 100 does that mean you'll ever leave the house? Just to Mae you feel better there are people that literally share needles, have injuries at works or willingly have unprotected sex with strangers and leave with nothing. Just don't actively put yourself in harms way and you'll be fine and try to ignore the intrusive thoughts. PTSD is a bit more complicated, I highly recommend going to a therapist for that. My trauma was actually getting a false positive for an hiv test (like you can get this close but not have it) and then had to go through series of ptsd therapy sessions that really helped. I also developed a really bad ocd response to hiv but I realized if I continue I'll never be able to leave the house or date or anything etc. ### Hey sorry to intrude 
I dmed you ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIV/comments/q6lbix/pep_and_testing/
q601li,"Possible exposure to HIV? So I did bad things this weekend.

I was totally drunk when I got a hooker (in germany, not a street hooker tho) and had sex with her. The bad thing is, I noticed that she wouldnt show me her vagina (she layed on her side), so I assume I might had anal sex with her. Now I think she might have been a transgender woman and I just didnt notice because I was so drunk. After like 15 to 20 minutes I stopped and didnt cum, because I thought she was hiding something. I don't really know if we used a condom tho, we probably did, dont know for sure! 

After that she asked if i'd like to have a line of  cocaine  and I said yes. sniffed the line right after she did, with the same Euro note. After that I wen't home and slept all day.

Now my mind drives me crazy and I was hoping someone could cheer me up. 

I learned about PEP just today, so its too late to go to the doctor.

This group estimated 0.11% for insertive UAI with circumcision, based on the assumptions that the actual HIV prevalence in HIV status unknown partners and in HIV negative partners was 10% and 0.5%, respectively. ### To anyone reading this aferwards, I tested negative after 6 weeks.

As a trans woman who has had plenty ov lovers that were also trans, I would say you don't have much to worry about. Trans people tend to take very very good care ov themselves.

Please do not make the same mistake as I did. It stressed me out so much to the point I started to lose weight cause I couldn't stomach anything. And then my mind would convince my that I have symptoms. Get tested again in another 2 weeks and if it's negative, you're negative. I personally think youre negative already.

In my opinion, IF he was positive and didn’t disclose, he is likely on treatment and non-transmissible - which puts you at no risk physically.

Unless he’s a sociopath - but an HIV diagnosis really messes with people and they spend a lot of time feeling guilty and scared to pass on the virus. Most people are cautious not to put others in the position they are in - because they know what it’s like… if anything, most people refrain from sex because they are scared or rejection or the stress it would cause them.

q3cu3h,"Please help me understand my HIV tests My scenario:

4 years ago I had unprotected vaginal sex with an escort. To be specific, she was a very unhealthy looking street prostitute. Easily the dumbest decision I’ve ever made.

About 3 weeks after I felt a strange pain in penis/groin area and freaked out. I hit tested for hiv and chlamidia/gon and was negative. I then felt a lot of fatigue for the next 6 weeks or so.

I tested again at 7 weeks and then 12 weeks with 4the gen test. Negative.

Was still paranoid due to some strange symptoms. Burning sensation in face and arms. Muscle aches. Face turned a shade of red and noticed Seb Derm around month 5.

Got tested full panel at 6 mths and negative for everything.

Been tormenting myself ever since and have done 4th gen tests at 1 year, and most recently at 3 years.

In total I’ve had 9 tests all negative. Am I truly negative at this point? Is it possible I could have that many false negative tests?

Your input is truly appreciated.",17,2021-10-07 12:29:20-04:00,"You’re negative bro, trust me I’m going through the same thing with my mental health but bro you good.

Let's see if you hv symptoms and these are due to hiv that means viral particle are in your body that means core protien p24 should be detectable and even if your body start producing antibodies therefore antibody part should be detectable but neither p24 was there nor the antibodies are there that means no hiv virus in your blood stream which justify that you did not catch this infection.

So I hit rock bottom and went to a strip club, I am not sure what happened due to blacking out but I believe there is a possibility of having intercourse with one of the dancers. If I were to have had unprotected sex, what are the chances I have HIV? I got tested with a 4th gen 7 & 12 days after and they both came back negative. Should I still be concerned?",10,2021-10-07 20:47:29-04:00,"Welp - First off, depending where you live, the chances of even coming into contact with HIV are low. 

Let’s say you did come into contact with the virus.  HIV is actually a very weak virus that actually isn’t as infectious as we have been told - it needs an alignment of specific things in order for infection to occur: a high amount of the virus present in the infected partner, a substantial method of entry into the new hosts body and an inadequate immune response from the new host. 

Receptive anal sex is the **riskiest** sexual act with a relative risk of 1.9% per encounter when having anal intercourse with someone with *unmanaged/untreated* HIV. [The risks for all other sexual acts fall dramatically below this.](https://www.aidsmap.com/about-hiv/estimated-hiv-risk-exposure) Add a properly used condom into the equation, and this % goes down to zero. (Latex and polyurethane condoms are highly effective in preventing HIV)

**Additionally**, if the Person with HIV is on medication and has an undetectable viral load, even when condoms are not used used this risk goes down to [zero](https://www.catie.ca/en/positiveside/summer-2017/uu) (known as U=U or treatment as prevention and is backed by the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/art/index.html), the [NIH](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/science-clear-hiv-undetectable-equals-untransmittable), [UNAIDS](https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/featurestories/2018/july/undetectable-untransmittable) and many other organizations based on data from the [PARTNER](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)30418-0/fulltext) & [PARTNER2](https://www.aidsmap.com/news/jul-2018/zero-transmissions-mean-zero-risk-partner-2-study-results-announced) studies.)

That’s why I am so concerned ### This comment was very insightful though so thank you. I am still worried though ### While close to accurate. Not completely as a male having sex with a female it's much lower. It's around in 1 in 2000 ### Lol it is accurate. 

I provided a link to a website that has a table describing the risk for all other acts - I only identified the risk of receptive anal in my comment as it is the worst case scenario and I don’t have the energy to type out all the risk factors. 

But since we are sticklers for info here: 
As an insertive male into a vagina, the risk of contracting HIV when exposed to *active* HIV is 0.04%. This increases to 0.11% for inserting anally. (you can multiply these by 7.25 to get the relative risk during the acute/most infectious stage) And, as mentioned above, the risk is **zero** when there’s an undetectable viral load.

Please identify the inaccurate info in my original post. ### It's difficult for a male to catch HIV from a female is my point. Statistically speaking you would need to have sex everyday for 5 years to catch it once. ### Ok - but where did I say the opposite?  I literally didn’t. ### ",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIV/comments/q3mqv2/help/
q3m41l,"I may have been exposed to HIV in a lab. Thoughts/experience with PEP? I will be seeing occupational health services tomorrow. Will be 48 hours post exposure.


Yesterday I rubbed my itchy eye on my lab coat near my elbow and was shocked when I felt a tiny bit of wetness on my eyelashes/eyelid. I was uncapping blood specimens to load on a machine.


I washed my hands and touched the area to feel if it was sticky like serum... it was not. No eye irritation today. I highly doubt specimen got into my eye, but if occupational health offers me PEP, I will probably give it a shot.

HIV is VERY difficult to catch - even in the riskiest situation of receptive anal sex during the MOST infectious stage (first 6-12 weeks after infection), the chance of infection is around 11%. And that’s like, multimillions of copies of the virus being inserted directly into a microtorn anus tissue. 

In order for infection to occur, there would have had to have been a large amount of active HIV virus in the blood that may have been on your lab coat. It would have then had to enter into the mucous membranes of your eye and then your immune system would need to be unable to fight them off. 

Depending how old the specimens are, Any water or temperature change likely killed any HIV virus on your coat - if it was even there to begin with. ### if occupational health offer you pep for such a non exposure, then they're not following guidelines. ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIV/comments/q3m41l/i_may_have_been_exposed_to_hiv_in_a_lab/

phase 3 trials serve a purpose. besides demonstrating efficacy, they demonstrate safety in a way prior phases can't bcuz they aren't powered to detect small but very serious or even fatal risks.  
  
i agree that desperate peeps should get early access to unproven medicines if they want it. but it should be done by expanding compassionate use. and forcing pharma to provide compassionate use drugs to people whose fda petitions are approved.  
  
this bill isn't for patients. it's for pharma. it doesn't provide earlier access to unproven medicines at low cost for desperate patients.  
  
what it does is DRASTICALLY lower the standards of safety and efficacy that must be met before pharma can SELL their products. it also allows pharma TO CHARGE US WHATEVER THEY WANT for the unproven drugs. it forces insurance to cover it AT ANY PRICE PHARMA SETS. but not to cover it fully, so we'll still get stuck with big copays. so they get paid for using us as guinea pigs! and then, when people are harmed by any dangerous and ineffective drugs, this bill COMPLETELY SHIELDS PHARMA FROM LIABILITY FOR THE DAMAGES!  
  
pharma wants to have their cake and eat it too. they wanna charge thru the nose for medicines not proven safe or effective. but they don't want patients to get a dime when we're harmed by their dangerous and useless drugs!  
  
there's a reason this bill is supported by the astroturf, pharma funded 'patient advocacy groups' but NOT the grassroots groups actually looking out for our welfare.

I really don't think you should worry. ### How do you think HIV is transmitted exactly? ### You could kindly ask him to show you his latest lab results. ### Im really really sorry if i ask this but may we know how u got diagnosed ? Much appreciated 🙏🏻 ### I don’t think anyone with any understanding here would say anything negative about you having unprotected sex. You are undetectable so no risk to your partner at all! :) ### Semen, blood, vaginal/anal fluids ### Took two different tests. One in a clinik along with my regular STD checkup.

Thank you. ### We’re any of these things in his mouth when he kissed you? 

Are your mouth cuts open, weeping wounds or are they healing/scabbed? 

If he was undetectable, he cannot pass HIV to you. The risk is [zero](https://www.catie.ca/en/positiveside/summer-2017/uu) (known as U=U or treatment as prevention and is backed by the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/art/index.html), the [NIH](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/science-clear-hiv-undetectable-equals-untransmittable), [UNAIDS](https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/featurestories/2018/july/undetectable-untransmittable) and many other organizations based on data from the [PARTNER](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)30418-0/fulltext) & [PARTNER2](https://www.aidsmap.com/news/jul-2018/zero-transmissions-mean-zero-risk-partner-2-study-results-announced) studies.)

No HIV- partner became HIV+. If you can't detect it, you can't transmit it. ### No they were not. 

These are the cuts that you get from brushing your teeth, so they bleed every time I brush.

I read if he too, had mouth cuts his blood could possibly get into my bloodstream because of my cuts. ### Those are not open wounds and are not a method for HIV transmission. 

He would have to be openly gushing blood in his mouth AND have a high HIV viral load and you would have to have literal open wound doorways into your bloodstream for there to be any chance of infection. ### Thank you for the information. Also, I know that getting tested can answer all of this, but in reality, am I just paranoid? I got tested 3 days after it all and was negative, I will be getting another next month. ### HIV won’t show up on tests until a month or so after exposure. But getting tested regularly is important regardless - most new infections occur because people don’t know their status. ### Again, thank you for the information. ### ",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIV/comments/q29n4l/should_i_be_worried/
q26pla,Parents asking too many questions So my bf is HIV positive and he is undetectable. We have been together for 4yrs. My parents moved in with me in January and since then my bf has been worried because he gets his medication shipped to the house and he doesn’t want my parents finding out he has HIV because he feels like my parents will judge him. Knowing my parents they most definitely will because my mom made a comment about how if he has anything I better not stay with him. Then a couple of months ago my dad got licensed to sign people up for life insurance and wanted my bf to be his first customer and my bf agreed. A guy called my bf telling him he got denied because of his hiv which he understood. Then today my mom asked me what medical condition does he have that got him denied because she knew for awhile and didn’t know how to ask. Like that is just so rude to me to ask that because it’s none of her business. I just told her I have no idea (because it’s not my place to put my bf business out there). It’s just sad how people have such a negative view on people with hiv.,6,2021-10-05 18:01:49-04:00,"yr bf should've known better than to agree to try to buy life insurance from yr dad.  c'mon!   what did he expect to happen?    but **you** need to tell your mom 'none of your business, butt out' on these questions.  they're **your** parents.  **you're** the one who needs to run this interference.  it's awkward for him, as the son in law, to respond to requests like 'buy insurance from me'.  **you** are the one who needs to be like, 'no dad, i don't feel comfortable with my bf buying insurance from you.'  you need to block yr parents so he doesn't have to.

are yr parents going to open his mail?  if they're that nosy, you shouldn't have let them move in.  he can have the pharmacy ship somewhere else if he's that worried.

it was kind of unfair for you to have yr parents move in if you knew they were gonna nose around in his business and then subject him to stigma.  imo, you need to block that shit better.  you should've told yr dad 'no' on the life ins before yr bf applied.  and told yr mom to butt tf out or she's not welcome to live with you anymore.

i mean, it's not really fair to subject yr bf to all this anxiety of living with nosy judgemental assholes.

my inlaws weren't initially thrilled with me being positive.  ofc that was long before u=u or prep, so they had better reasons than just stigma.  but they love me and they got over it.  idk if yr parents eventually would too.  if not, then living with them long term just isn't gonna be good for yr bf's peace of mind ### don't you think it's normal that you mother worries about you? You're her son, ofc she worries that you can get a disease if she suspects something... The not normal thing would be if she didn't care at all and had suspicion ### I feel like you posted more because you wanted to vent than actually looking for advice so I'll craft my response accordingly.

It is sad that so many people have such a negative view of people with HIV. With the amazing treatments that are available and the fact that u=u is a thing the worst part of having hiv for me personally is the stigma. I haven't told my own parents let alone a partner's. But I wish you luck in getting them off your back. And hopefully by some miracle they'll get to a place where they'd be ok even if they did find out. ### I tested hiv positive yesterday, i don’t know what I did to myself and my family. It is all because of cheating my innocent wife. Now all the guilt is killing me. I have sent my wife and my little boy to check the hiv. 
It was 8 years ago when I was living away from town for work. Back then I had a relation with a girl for long time. One night I was drunk and I had unprotected sex with that girl, that’s the only girl I had sex beside my wife. I asked her in the morning if she had any diseases and her answer was no. However after few days,  to make sure I checked hiv and it was negative. I should have checked one more time after few months that is where I failed now I’m going to pay a huge price. I’m worried about my son I hope and pray god to spare him at least. Pray for  my little boy and my wife. ### First of all I didn’t know he signed up for life insurance or that my dad was pushing him to do that until after it was done. My bf really didn’t know they were going to ask him about his health when he did it like honest to god. Also if I knew my parents were that nosy I wouldn’t have let them move in with me in the first place. The only reason I let them move in with me was because they sold their house and was wanting to buy a new one so they technically wasn’t supposed to be here that long. Honestly I’m very shocked with how they are behaving (maybe because it’s been awhile since I lived with them). Like all this stuff happened after they moved in. No they don’t go through his mail, he is just worried that they might start to ask questions because if the mail comes and they pick it up they will hear the pills. But luckily they haven’t but I know they want to ask but never once have they open his mail. The fact that you are blaming me is ridiculous because I would never let them move in if I knew they were like that. Like honestly my parents have shocked me with the way they have been acting lately. Especially with my mom, out of the 25 yrs I’ve know this woman her behavior these past couple of months is ridiculous. ### You are right - the fact crumblingbees is blaming you IS ridiculous. I’d ignore her on this one. She can be very short and unreasonable at times.

I’m sorry your parents are so stuck in that mindset. Could you start subtly educating them (without exposing him) - eg “wow did you know that nowadays drugs can make ppl with hiv undetectable - which means they can’t pass on the virus!” Other than that there’s not much you yourself can do, as you can’t change other people’s behaviour - unfortunately you’ve got to put up with that rubbish.

In terms of the mail and deliveries - I’d be strict about that. You’ve got to stand up to them and be direct and say that on no terms are they to open mail not addressed to them. If they’re in your house they have to respect your privacy and your rules. 

Good luck! ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIV/comments/q26pla/parents_asking_too_many_questions/

SIR. PLEASE LEARN PROPER INFORMATION ABOUT STI’S AND THEIR TRANSMISSION BEFORE ENGAGING IN SEXUAL INTERCOURSE.

To put the risk of getting HIV into perspective and spread a little awareness here, receptive anal sex is the riskiest sexual act with a relative risk of 1.9% per encounter when having anal intercourse with someone with *unmanaged* HIV. [The risks for all other sexual acts fall dramatically below this.](https://www.aidsmap.com/about-hiv/estimated-hiv-risk-exposure) Add a properly used condom into the equation, and this % goes down to zero. (Latex and polyurethane condoms are highly effective in preventing HIV)

HIV is actually a very weak virus that actually isn’t as infectious as we have been told - it needs an alignment of specific things in order for infection to occur: a high amount of the virus present in the infected partner, a substantial method of entry into the new hosts body and an inadequate immune response from the new host. 

**Additionally**, if the Person with HIV is on medication and has an undetectable viral load, even when condoms are not used used this risk goes down to [zero](https://www.catie.ca/en/positiveside/summer-2017/uu) (known as U=U or treatment as prevention and is backed by the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/art/index.html), the [NIH](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/science-clear-hiv-undetectable-equals-untransmittable), [UNAIDS](https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/featurestories/2018/july/undetectable-untransmittable) and many other organizations based on data from the [PARTNER](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)30418-0/fulltext) & [PARTNER2](https://www.aidsmap.com/news/jul-2018/zero-transmissions-mean-zero-risk-partner-2-study-results-announced) studies.) This also significantly lowers the chance of transferring HIV through childbirth (to zero with proper adherence to meds). ### your girlfriend is 14 her hymen probably may have broke, causing the blood. its what happens to many girls the first few times they have penetrative sex. ### ok but am I safe ik the risk of sex and I plan on using protection next time but both of us don't have stds or anything and I didnt have a cut so our blood didn't mix so am I safe because I believe I'm safe ### am I safe ### K you clearly didn’t read anything I said. 🙄 ### Of course you are safe. Unless your GF is highly promiscuous or injects drugs by way of dirty needles I would wager she has a lot more to be concerned about than you do. 

However it does sound like you are on track to be a dad before you get your license. ### I did but you didn't give me a clear answer ### yeah ik we weren't planning on finishing we were doing something and we wanted to try i dont regret what we did but I regret not wearing protection even if nothing bad happened ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIV/comments/q1h1oi/im_scared_of_hiv/

HIV is a weak virus and it basically needs the stars to align in order to infect in the forest place. Couple that with the unlikelihood of a male being infected from PIV Intercourse and you’re looking at a miracle.

I also don’t blame u for being upset if you feel like he deliberately put ur health at risk. If he did then that’s a crime and he needs to answer for what he did. I would say maybe don’t come at him aggressively, try to be calm and the opposite of upset. That way u can get the truth. Being confrontational will only lead to him lying. As far as the STD, he may not have known he had anything. I had a friend give me an std without knowing he had it. It can happen if he doesn’t get tested regularly (as was the case with my friend).

Thank you!",33,2021-10-01 09:31:39-04:00,"[deleted] ### You can if you need the peace of mind. I am sure you are good though if your test came back negative. HIV doesn't take long to show up like the internet will have you believe. You are negative. Good for you 🙂 be more careful next time. I know from experience that having to go get on a regime of pep is just a pain in the ass. ### Great news! Have you and your provider talked about whether PrEP make work for you? ### PEP doesn't delay seroconversion. Your test was 95% accurate. Test again  3 months after PEP completion (99.97% accuracy) ### If you tested negative I think you will stay negative granted you take precautions before anymore sexual encounters. Women very rarely transmit the virus to men via sexual intercourse by the way. I think you're good man. ### Btw does this woman know who infected her?? Or how long shes been carrying the virus? How did she react when the results came in? I am just curious. ### Hey Marco I got tested 6 weeks after pep and it is non reactive. Is it somehow conclusive? Thank you! ### [deleted] ### What type of test was it? ### Well the test came back negative so it's got to be something else. First thing tomorrow at 9 AM go to your local health department and get one more rapid HIV test. The whole process should take less than hour. The test itself only takes 20 min. That way when it shows up negative you will know it's not HIV. I seriously doubt after a negative test a second one will all of a sudden be positive. It doesnt work like that. Just go get one more to rule it out. Tell the people there what's going on. They can refer u somewhere that can get to the bottom of what is going on with you. See a physician. I'm sorry you're going through this. I'm sure it will all be resolved. I really think you're gonna be fine. ### By the way the flu like symptoms that come on after hiv exposure dont start for 3 weeks after somebody gets infected... ### 4th gen antibody ### [deleted] ### [deleted] ### It is very conclusive. Some guidelines, like UK guidelines, recommend a window period of six weeks for a 4th generation antigen/antibody test. By this time 99% of infections will be detected. A negative result at 6 weeks with a 4th generation test does not need to be confirmed. ### The HIV specialist I saw for prep a few years ago said you can usually take a test after like 2 weeks. The internet however says 4 weeks. I bet a blood test would tell you for sure. They can do it at the emergency room. They might try to tell you to wait....  tell me about this girl that infected you. Was she feeling sick or anything? What made you guys decide to go test? Was she surprised at her positive status? ### Regardless it sounds like it is just too early.. I think you should do what I suggested in the morning. It sounds like it is something else. Not only that u tested negative and women so very rarely pass the virus through sex to men. I knew of a couple some years back where the woman was positive and the man wasnt and they were together 10 years. Had sex onna regular bases. No condoms. They just didnt do it while she was on her period. That was a story I heard through a friend of mine and they were his friends and he wasnt the type to lie. And like I keep saying women dont pass it to men. I mean it can happen but it's unusual. ### [deleted] ### Go anywhere... urgent care, the emergency room. The health department. U gotta start somewhere. Good luck. I really believe you are gonna be okay ### [deleted] ### [deleted] ### Share your experience if you don't mind ### Well i was drunk one night and i slept with a lady that was an iv drug user. I used no condom, even did anal. A few days later i realised the terrible mistake i had done. And i felt sick straight away, started googling symptoms and freaking out. I went for multiple test and was negative. The more symptoms i googled the more symptoms showed up. I was drinking non stop for 3 months and was ready to end it all. At the end of 3 months i tested negative and the symptoms just left. Because it was all in my head. I have gone for many tests since then all good. But i still have massive paranoia and when ever i have sex or even get a bj or even handjob i tent to freak out afterwards and start feeling sick. So ive realised its all in the head. This has been going on for 3 years on and off. Ive just booked in to see a counciler. ### But what i learned was to always use protection and not do silly things. ### Bro this is exactly my experience. This is exactly what I'm going through. ### I'm planning to do viral load test since it can detect HIV even by 2 weeks I hear ### Apparently there is such thing as being absolutely terrified of the thought of contracting HIV. To the point it's like an OCD thing. Intrusive thoughts that just wont stop. Definitely see a professional. It's terrible living in constant fear you've contracted the virus and feeling like you have no control. I myself have only been like that the times I was either too scared to go get tested, or was freaking out about a person I was intimate with... which are really one in the same I suppose. After the test came back though I was relieved and moved on with my life. There are lots of people out there who can not seem to move past it. ### Ye bro its fucked up it all feels so real ay. Youll be okay chances are you dont have it. ### Remember it’s very hard for a guy to contract it from vaginal sex ... you’re looking at a chance of 0.04%. There’s a very good chance you’ll be fine. All the best. ### My body aches badly bro. Been suicidal back and forth. I can't even do day to day activities. Heavy on the alcohol I'm just in bed in my room drinking spirits without no chaser even ### So those who get infected. Are they unlucky or what ### Been there done that, i know what youre talking about in all honesty youre most likely fine. What country are you in? ### If i can give you any advice, please dont search up on symptoms its only going to make you feel worse. The more you read the more symptoms pop up. ### I suppose so. And there are other factors that increase likelihood of it being transmitted. 1) high viral load (Perhaps the other person has just only just got hiv and so their viral load is very high) 2) other STDs - eg herpes. ### It's just like I told you man, women very rarely transmit it to men... ### Im in Malawi where they use Alere Determine HIV 1/2. I don't know what generation it is but everywhere I go they say come back in 3 months to be 100% sure.

My plan is to do it like this ;

6 weeks

After how many weeks or months ### Does she remember if you used a condom? Do you believe you used a condom and are just not sure or are you 100% sure you didnt use one. I sometimes start freaking out thinking i was injected with dirty blood and i just didnt notice. Thats just the anxiety and paranoia talking. It takes me a while to snap out of it at times. ### She say she was drunk. 
But she says we did use rubber

I used to see an HIV specialist for a prep prescription when I was a commercial sex worker and I asked him a bunch of questions and he told me that theres never any false negative test results and if anything maybe a false positive.

Like I said, you tested negative 2 months after the sex, i promise you are most likely good. I'd say I promise you're 100 percent good but I'm not a doctor.

You are more likely to have an immaculate conception than contract HIV from the situation you described. 

PEP will not help you. Therapy and medications will help you. ### I’m very sorry that you’re so scared about this. It sounds like you have a quite serious health anxiety issue about hiv. You should try counselling or therapy (if possible - not sure what country you are in) because otherwise this anxiety will cause you many problems and upset in your life. You should prioritise this over anything else as it’s really affecting you.

There is little point in me going into the details of why you DEFINITELY DON’T have hiv, as your health anxiety won’t allow you to believe me. But I promise you that you do not have hiv. A cut on a nurse’s finger is meaningless, you can’t get hiv that way, even if she’s not wearing gloves. And the syringe will have been new and clean. You have no risk - really, 100% NO risk.

P.s anything to do with your period cycle is again definitely not a symptom of hiv. ### I just Wana be safe than sorry ### You don't know how relieved I am to read what u wrote ,oh thank you for not being rude and u sound very sympathetic .thank you ❤️🙏 it would be cool to just stay in touch . ### You're not being safe.

The chances of him having HIV in the first place are low but we can pretend he does for the sake of education. 

If he does have HIV and it is undiagnosed/untreated - you’re chances of contracting it from receptive anal sex are 1.9%. The chances of getting HIV from oral and wildly low - they are almost non existent. 

However, if he’s on treatment  and undetectable there is zero risk of HIV transmission. ### Unprotected anal sex with someone of unknown status I would recommend you go on PEP immediately. Go to A and E if no clinics are open - I’m fairly sure if you do your research that somewhere will be open for this kind of emergency. Although statistically the chances are low, you should still fully protect yourself and taking PEP as soon as you can will help you do that. Don’t delay, please act immediately. ### Looks like there could be a clinic in Sidwell Street that’s open on Sundays ... but 2bh as time is not on your side (because you need to take PEP within 72 hours) you can go to any A and E - they can prescribe you PEP there. Go now or tonight. ### you can call a local health clinic and ask where you if you don’t know the guy well enough to chat him back and ask if he’s HIV, if he’s undetectable, or when was the last time he tested for HIV you may be able to get an oral rapid test from a local health clinic and see if you qualify for a PEP (post-exposure prophylactic) program, if there is one in your area.

I'm very anxious right now... ### I went to the A&e and they said they don’t have the support or equipment to test me so I have to go the clinic on Monday ### Yes, it’s incredibly effective. You did the right thing in getting it so quickly. You will be fine provided you take it exactly as prescribed (eg take it at same times a day and don’t miss a dose). I know it’s a worrying time but you have pretty much no real chance of seroconverting if you take it properly. You will be ok! ### You’re not getting tested ... you’re asking for PEP medication as an emergency. They have to give it to you and I know they have it there. Tell then you’ve had a high risk exposure and that you need PEP immediately. ### Thank you very much. That's good to know! ### I told them that but they said it’s a low chance and I need to get other test done for stids and I have to wait until Monday ### Well that’s pretty bad of them. To confirm - you had unprotected anal sex? If you did then you must go on PEP. They must give it to you. ### I did tell me that and how I have 72 hours to stop it if I have it but they said go to the clinic ### Jesus. That’s really not good. Will you be within the 72 hours if you go first thing Monday morning to the clinic? ### Actually I will still have time as I had sex around 20:30 and I’m planning to leave at 9 so I can get there when they first open ### Ok - good luck.

pnt83q,"Question to other Pos peeps. Okay so I tend to have a policy where I'm pretty open to talking about my status especially with sexual partners. But I've been told that since I'm undetectable, it isn't something I NEED to tell every sexual partner. I've been with my partner for two years, he's HIV neg, and I'm HIV pos & Undetectable. He's the one assuring this to me.

Which tbh I understand because it can definitely cause anxiety in both me and the other person, even though scientifically we know it cannot be transmitted. It's just something that is already being controlled the best it can be. But I also feel it does need to be disclosed at some point if I want to continue having relations with someone.

pkksrj,"“Abnormalities” I’m straight male but had sex with a random girl without a condom 3 months ago one night stand. I never thought about HIV because I’m ignorant and only thought it was gay males that got it. I went to get blood work and STD checks last Monday on the 1st of September symptoms I had were shortness of breath and extreme fatigue. It’s not covid. My doctor just called me yesterday and scheduled an immediate follow up tomorrow. All he could say is he found “abnormalities”. I’m very worried it’s HIV. The reason I think it’s HIV is because I got all the other test results but the only one missing is the HIV test result. I’m worried that they didn’t send me the result because it’s positive.

I’m prepared for the worst case scenario and have been doing a ton of research last night and all day today. I understand that if I do get it it is not the end of the world because of treatments. This is a huge wake up call and Regardless of the outcome tomorrow I’m going to spread HIV awareness from here on out to my friends and family. I will let you guys know tomorrow what my results are.",11,2021-09-08 18:31:25-04:00,"It was negative. I got called back because it was chlamydia.

As someone living with it my biggest problem isn't having a virus. It's that there is so much social stigma surrounding it. God speed little doodle. ### Good luck. 

But also, what do you mean about HIV awareness - like fear, or information? ### Good luck dude ### its very hard for a female to transmit. There is an advocate on youtube Jennifer Vaughn. she literally had aids with viral load of 500k and her boyfriend at the time didn't contract it even though they were together and sexually active. Even if there is abnormalities it could bee false positive also just so you know some people that had active covid also tested false positive hiv ### You're probably good. Woman dont usually give it to men. Even if its positive you will take the meds and become undetectable. You're doing the right thing getting tested. ### Any results? ### I really doubt it's HIV, not only is HIV rare in the heterosexual population the chances of catching it from a one time encounter is roughly 1 in 2000.   To show you how  unlikely it is from female to male transmission.  You would need to have sex with a positive person once a day for five years to catch it once. ### Information in general. I spoke to my close friends already and a lot of them don’t even get tested for it because “well I’m not gay why would I have it” type thing ### Please just ensure that you’re spreading proper info and not fear!

pinxhr,"What's the probability of catching HIV? Hi! I'm quite young still in my early 20s. When I started having sex couple of years ago I was rly dumb and never used protection (I've slept with 10+ people at this point, mostly no protection,some of it consensual, some not. It was quite messy). Since I cough std (ureaplasma) I got freaked and started being more careful. Anyways, I've been worried about the possibility of catching HIV but I was always so scared to get tested.. Still am. Especially scared of my family and people knowing if I am.. I don't even know enough about it and it's making me anxious for 2 years now, to the point of me having full on panic attacks and spiraling when I start thinking about it. Struggling to get rid of Ureaplasma for quite a long time made me anxious to be touched by people at all and the idea of sex started to freak me the f out. That, combined with unresolved issues with with people makes me so paranoid. I've read some info about the number of young people infected and it seems so big I'm fucking scared. I have no idea how to go about it and not f'ing jump through the window lol. I know the most obvious answer to this problem is for me to get tested and it's the only way I'll stop being paranoid but the idea of waiting for results makes me fucking panic. Is a possibility of catching HIV big? I fucking hope I didn't fuck it up that bad.. Anyways I have no idea why I wrote all of this, I guess trying to easy my stupid mind... (sry for my grammar)",15,2021-09-05 19:37:54-04:00,"too long, didn’t read. But to answer the original question in the title:

Being the insertive partner yields little to no risk at 0.11% per protectionless encounter for anal sex and 1.9% for the receiver. If the person was in the acute stage (the most infectious stage - aka the first 12ish weeks after infection) you could multiply that by 7.25.

To put it into perspective, receptive anal sex is the riskiest sexual act with a relative risk of 1.9% per encounter when having anal intercourse with someone with *unmanaged* HIV. [The risks for all other sexual acts fall dramatically below this.](https://www.aidsmap.com/about-hiv/estimated-hiv-risk-exposure) Add a condom into the equation, and this % goes down to almost zero. (Latex and polyurethane condoms are highly effective in preventing HIV)

**However**, if the Person with HIV is on medication and has an undetectable viral load, even when condoms are not used used this risk goes down to [zero](https://www.catie.ca/en/positiveside/summer-2017/uu) (known as U=U or treatment as prevention and is backed by the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/art/index.html), the [NIH](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/science-clear-hiv-undetectable-equals-untransmittable), [UNAIDS](https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/featurestories/2018/july/undetectable-untransmittable) and many other organizations based on data from the [PARTNER studies](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)30418-0/fulltext).)

So to answer your question, no - it’s really not easy to become infected with HIV even when you come into contact with the virus. It’s a weak virus that needs a perfect lineup of things in order to infect. Hit up [The World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids) for more info on transmission.

The reason HIV spreads is because people who do not know their status and aren’t responsible with regular testing spread it unknowingly. The only way to stop the HIV epidemic is for everyone to man up and get tested regularly. ### Hey you said in your post. Get. Tested. Why? Because if you don’t know you might be spreading it to other people. And if you do know then you get on meds, get to undetectable levels and you can’t transmit it. Ah the end of the day you owe it to yourself to be healthy and to stop the panic attacks. Hiv is not a death sentence anymore, you just take your meds if you’re positive and you live your life. 

Also u/thatpositivechick is right, risk is minimized for you being the insertion partner ### You have any symptom? ### So your admitting to having non consensual intercourse . Reported ### I've visited the site already many times.. I'm going to get tested tomorrow probably so there's that.. Also I'm a girl, I guess I haven't made that obvious enough ### I'm a girl so there's that. Also I know, I agree.. I don't have any sexual contact with people anymore.. I think the anxiety is the biggest problem, but I'm going tomorrow to get tested and get it over with. One of the problems is that my mom is a medical worker and she can see everything in my chart so I don't even have a slightest idea how to go about it.. I don't even know why I wrote that whole post. I wrote it in one of my panic states last night.. ### Not really, as far as I can remember.. I haven't had sex with anyone for a while now. ### Ok well as a female receiving PIV intercourse your chances of infection are 0.08 and 1.9% if it was anal.

Your choice - I just choose to cite my info when I give it. ### Do you really think anyone of them have hiv? ### Yeah okey thank you. I've seen that statistic. Just to make sure, that's the statistic for when you haven't used protection right? ### I wasn't sure, I didn't know most of them well. I just got tested and I'm negative for HIV tho! ### Yes.

pdfz65,"Cum on hands with tiny cuts, mutual masturbation with HIV+ person. Risk of contamination? Hello everyone,

A partner unfortunately came out as positive on their latest test, a few days after we had a few sessions of unprotected foreplay/sex. The only acts involved were mutual masturbation, facesitting (no oral contact) and there was no penetration whatsoever.

&#x200B;

However, it should be noted that:

&#x200B;

1. He came on my hand on a few occasions, and this worries me as I have a few small cuts on my fingers (I tend to bite them). None of these openings were bleeding during the act, that said.
2. I remember masturbating soon after he came on my hands, a few times.
3. We kissed a few times, but no saliva contact or transfer was involved.
4. A friend gave protected anal sex and unprotected oral to that person, and swallowed his cum. He does not appear to have any cuts or irritated areas inside his mouth, or on his gum.

&#x200B;

My question is, given what we've done, is the HIV+ risk real, or minimal? That friend and I will get tested in a few weeks from now, either way. Just looking for some more opinions... I've asked a few friends and a medical worker (not doctor), they all think we should be alright, but I'm still worried.

Help would be appreciated. Thank you.",3,2021-08-28 15:15:17-04:00,"I'd like to go ahead and say that transmission via saliva is practically unheard of. The poz person would have to be rockin a seeeriously high viral load for that to be an issue.

I have a feeling you're probably in the clear in this situation, but obviously testing is the only way to be sure. If the + person has an undetectable viral load, you're most certainly fine. 

However, I will express how deeply disappointed I am that he would put another person in harm's way simply for sexual gratification. In most places, it's illegal for him to not disclose his status to you BEFORE sexual contact and for good reason. I personally think it's pretty easy to live a normal life with HIV with how far medications have come, but still, I wouldn't wish it on anyone.

He could have at least told you sooner so you could have gone and gotten a regimen of Post Exposure Prophylaxis to completely prevent the chance of you contracting it.

Asking this question doesn't compel anyone to tell the truth - assuming they even *know* the truth.  As most new HIV infections happen amongst people who don't know they have it, the odd thing about asking ""do you have HIV"" is that the person who says ""yes"" is more trustworthy than the person who says ""no"" but can't provide evidence.

Keep that in mind.  Also know that someone with HIV but on successful treatment can't give it to you.  Scientifically proven.

Before you have sex, know how comfortable you are with certain things.  If it's condoms, it's always condoms.  If it's riding bare, then ask for a recent test result, or be cool with the risks.  And whatever criteria you put on your partner, be prepared to accept that criteria for yourself.

>He did have some small bumps around the under part of his dick head but it didn’t look gross or anything, it looked kind of normal like something I’ve seen before. I googled it and it came up as something called Pearly Penile Papules

100% normal condition.  They may not be attractive, and they may freak out people who aren't very hip on the ""seen many penises""-scene, but they're normal.

No matter what else you see, if there are no open sores, obvious warts, or pussy discharges, you're gonna have a hard time finding anything bad by just a visual inspection.

>He also had a white tongue

Also consistent with dry mouth.  A sign of dehydration.  Or recent/habitual alcohol consumption.  Thrush can present as a white tongue, but it tends to look hairy and the tongue will feel a bit meatier, and it's usually painful to the person who has it.

>had a rash on his neck that he kept trying to hide.

How sure of you it was a rash?  Rashes can have benign causes, without a doubt.  Sometimes we get them for no reason.  From an STI standpoint, the first thing I'd think is syphilis.  But people with HIV also get random rashes.

>Starting the first day afterwards I’ve felt tingling/ burning in my vagina where he rubbed his dick head on my hole, like right above my urethra and below my clit.

A of people experience post-coitus sensations.  I myself - a guy - almost always get an irritated urethra in the hours after oral sex for some reason.  I test regularly so I know it's just my body doing its thing and that it's just not found of others' saliva.

>After he rubbed it on me he said “now you have what I have”. I thought he was joking and told him to put a condom on. After he was done fucking me he said “Jokes on you I took the condom off halfway through” again

You found a keeper.  This guy probably gets off on freaking people out.  Either way, it's a huge red flag to even jokingly disregard someone's safer sex practices, and if there's anything you've learned from this experience, please let it be the power of saying ""no.""  The moment he joked about ignoring your wishes or said something fucked up like that is the moment you need to stop the fun.  You can find dick anywhere.

If I had to guess, he doesn't invite you to his home if he's intent on giving you something.  That kind of behavior is hugely criminal and nobody would want that tracing back to them.  I could be wrong, but that would be very interesting.

>Starting on the second or third day I started getting a burning/ tingling/ numbness in my feet and hands.

I guarantee you that's a manifestation of your anxiety.  When we start freaking out, our body draws blood into its core to protect its vital organs, and our extremities begin to tingle as a result.  We may even begin to feel a bit lightheaded or discombobulated, as from an evolutionary standpoint, our panic responses forgot that our brain is located in an extremity as well.

>The inside of my vagina burns and it looks irritated and a little swollen at the opening

It's funny what we see/feel when we go looking for it.   If you think something's wrong, you'll find it. Please keep that in mind. 

Also keep in mind that for women, UTIs are a frequent friend, especially sexually active ones.  It could coincidental or simply a normal result of your having sex.  Or it could be nothing.  But consider turning up your acidity all the same.  Cranberry Juice.

> I got tested on day 6 for all stds and everything came back negative. I’ve been swabbed for herpes and it came back negative and I have no bumps. The doctor gave me antivirals while I was there just in case but it’s been 6 days now and I feel like my symptoms have gotten worse.

1. No test at Day 6 for Herpes or anything else should be considered conclusive.

2. Your Doctor giving you antivirals at Day 6 is a stretch by him.  By Day 6 post-exposure, antivirals would have low efficacy as a PEP intervention.  The usual criteria is no later than 48-72 hours after exposure for expected efficacy.  Don't let these words stop you from taking antivirals, of course!  Take the regimen if that is your intent - it still has value, but commit to taking it completely or don't take it.

3. As for your symptoms ""getting worse,"" if you had an STI, it wouldn't really work that way this early in the game.  This is my way of saying, ""I'm not saying it's in your head, but...""

If you had HIV, you wouldn't feel bad for another couple weeks at minimum - it takes that long before your body starts churning out antibodies in numbers.  (That's kinda the whole deal with HIV and its staying power - it takes too long for the body to start fighting back that by then, HIV is already setting up shop and entrenching itself.)

>Everyday all day I look at my vagina checking it for new bumps or any changes, it’s all I think about, I can’t imagine having to live with this anxiety everyday for three months so I can get tested again.

See everything I've said above.  Your anxiety is through the roof and it's causing a lot of the tingling you're reporting.  It and your constant inspection is *causing you to feel (or think you feel) that your parts are irritated*!  Keep sticking your finger up your nose and you'll swear it's always bleeding on its own.

> I never even had an std before, but I don’t think he’s been tested. 

You don't know anything about him.  It's clear.  And that's not an insult to you, that's just me saying ""stop drawing conclusions one way or the other.""

>I just trusted him and made the biggest mistake of my life.

Don't trust your rando hookups.  Period.  But do just enjoy the dick.  

Make the decisions you need to make to keep yourself comfortable and sane.  If the dick doesn't want to cooperate, find another.

The only mistake you will make when having sex is compromising what makes you feel comfortable.

Don't think sex is a mistake or have some hindsight beatup session on yourself.  Be true to your wants and needs and conditions of enjoyment and you'll feel better after future encounters, even if that means a hookup doesn't end up happening.

**On Testing**

You can get an RNA test usually through your physician.

That said, the rapid tests are 90th-percentile accurate at about 3 weeks.  The 90-day thing is old news (but still good policy and that's why it's kept around).  The rapid tests may look and act the same, but they've evolved over the years and now they're very sensitive nowadays.

Get a pinprick test rapid test or blood draw (both better than ~~nasal~~ *cheek* swab) after Day 21.  Then again at Day 35 and again at Day 90.  Unless you have cancer or lupus or something (in which case you got bigger problems), Day 21 will provide you significant breathing room with a mid-90s certainty, and Day 35 will be nearly-definitive.

I used to be like you in so many ways (and in some ways still am.)  Please keep seeing your therapist and aim to build healthy relationships in your life *and with yourself.*  Honor your value and worth, and try your best to own who you are and what you do.  It's hard for many people to do this - including myself - but almost more important than succeeding at doing it, is understanding why you fail at doing it.  Recognizing your shortcomings and anxieties and triggers and why we look for sex where we do (and allow ourselves to do it with people who are lower than our standards should permit), is a huge step to putting life and one's actions and motivations into perspective.

Finally, I would suggest that knowledge is power, but not putting that knowledge into context is devastating.  Keep reading up more on STIs and HIV and what-not, but for heaven's sake, stay away from WebMD and other self-diagnosis sites.  Know how HIV therapy and prevention has evolved over the last decade and understand that tools multiple tools exist to ease your anxiety on the subject - again, Knowledge being one of them.  PrEP is another.  I would also suggest you get to know someone with HIV as well.  Not to complete your ""human trading card"" collection, but because it will help you humanize the condition. It doesn't define people.  And that goes a long way to making you feel more comfortable with the subject. ### >It’s now been 12 days since possible exposure and the anxiety has been non stop constant crying and I can’t eat or sleep.

Is prep something I can take now or is it too late? I heard it had to be taken within 3 days after possible exposure ### Do you know where I can get an rna test? I’m looking online and I only see websites to order it on but I think it’s a scam ### Yes I am praying to God I didn’t catch anything. This has opened my eyes to the real evil in the world. It has changed my life forever. I hope karma gets his ass ### In the most infectious stage relative risk increases sevenfold. So you can multiply the 0.08 by 7.25 - bringing your worst case scenario risk to 0.6%. ### It sounds like you got an antibody test done. Typically those involve a finger poke and they extract a drop of blood onto a little testing kit. You get results back in about 20 minutes because the test is only looking for antibodies which would only be present if you were infected. While it may provide a little peace of mind, it can take anywhere between 3 to 6 months for a person that has been exposed to HIV to develop antibodies.

Let me just add that I myself went through a scare a few years back and it was the most difficult thing I’ve ever had to go through. You have to stay positive and not think the worst. I kept looking online and driving myself crazy with fear and anxiety. I know it’s hard and you’ll get through it. You just have to stay positive and confide in someone if u can. It’s even harder having to hold it all inside and go through this alone. ### I would avoid ordering anything online. If u live in or near a major city, I’m sure you can find a reputable lab company that can provide it. ### Which is still very low, thank god. I would have to be extremely unlucky to have been infected I think. I swear my mind is playing tricks on me I feel like my whole body is itchy everywhere now lol ### That can definitely happen. 

Getting tested is definitely important. And if this guy did have something and knowingly exposed you to anything - press charges for sure. ### ",5,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIV/comments/p9w3vj/im_so_scared/

p999t2,"Anxiety about HIV- One-night stand help Hi

I'm from India and I recently had a sexual encounter with a sex worker (girl). 

We'd multiple sex acts during that night: 3 vaginal intercourse and 1 oral sex(receiver).

First two intercourse happened during the night, and I was completely drunk so during the second time I didn't had ejaculation. She loosened the condom a bit to reduce the friction (what is the possible exposure?) . We left as it is and went to sleep. 

PS: All the vaginal intercourse were protected expect that intentional condom loose and the oral sex was unprotected. 

I got worried and visited a sexologist. He recommended taking PEP. I started PEP on the third day (50th hour).

Can I get hiv from a dildo? ,4,2021-08-20 18:25:35-04:00,"HIV does poorly in the air at at room temperature. So unless it went right from someone else into you, you're likely okay from an HIV standpoint.

As the other poster alluded to, bacteria and heartier viruses are a significant-enough concern. But even then, the length of exposure to environment plays a role.

Get the full workup at 30 days and you should be good to go.  If you're worries about HIV, 3 weeks gives you 90th-percentile confidence.

I get the allure of dom play, but even submissives need to assert their boundaries, often in the form of a pre-session discussion.

Remember: healthy Dom/sub play is about the *willing* relinquishing/surrendering of power, with conditions of its return. It isn't about having power taken from you without your consent.  That's bad practice and a good Dom would never practice that. A good Dom would treat the power you give them with consideration and not abuse it.

Long story short, find a new Dom. ### Couple of points: 

1. Super AIDS is a little offensive, no?

2. To answer your question, no, you can't get HIV from a dildo.

3. You can, however, get a whole host of sexually transmitted diseases that way.

4. Why would you agree to that? ### >Couple of points: 
>
>1. Super AIDS is a little offensive, no?

My positive partner calls his suppressed viral load ""Super AIDS.""

I get why OP would make humor of their anxiety, and I don't think they meant to be offensive.

>2. To answer your question, no, you can't get HIV from a dildo.

Not entirely true. It depends on what's on the dildo and how long it's been exposed to the environment.

But in general practice, you're right. It's so unlikely it's as close to ""can't"" as can be.

>3. You can, however, get a whole host of sexually transmitted diseases that way.

This would be the bigger concern, yup. ### I kinda like the term Super AIDS myself. I would like to think if Super AIDS was a Marvel hero, his arch nemesis would be Sneaky AIDS. Nobody wants Sneaky AIDS. 🤣
I make AIDS jokes all the time and when a stranger tries to tell me how offensive it is I just grin and drop my status bomb on them. It makes me so giddy when I get to tell someone they need to stop trying to be offended for me.

p2bbmy,"Freaking out about hiv, actually unable to hold my nerves together. I'm genuinely scared. So I had sex with someone in a bout of depression after repeated mental pressure put onto me by my family. I got threatened with getting killed by my father at least 4 times and he almost did it and I ended up pretty much with a ptsd. I thought I was losing my mind, had bouts of depersonalization and derealization.

After a month of dealing with these issues I was with a friend and we had sex with a third person (he suggested we do it so I can have 'fun' and forget about my issues, haven't really had sex for a long time). I wore a condom the entire time, except took it off briefly after the first oral (before any penetration) and stupidly used the same condom again after. As far is I could see the condom did not burst and my cum was still in it after I removed it after sex. It all feels like a blurry dream since I was in such a bad mental state.

I got freaked out because we met the third person for the first time, so I did not know their background. When I asked if they had HIV through messages later they said no, but I also know they have a lot of unprotected sex.

I was put on pep a day later, but after 3 days when I went to the HIV centrum they told me the risk was so low that I should stop taking pep. About 5 days later I developed a rash on my inner thighs which looked like infected hair follicles. I was given an ointment by the doctor which helped it go away for the most part. I was also feeling itchiness all over my body which went away after 2 more days.

About 7 days later I started getting a small sore in my mouth that healed after 3 days followed by another sore. I also developed diarrhea. At the same time I also started noticing small rashes here and there that come and go within like 30 minutes up to 2 hours. They are very mild and disappear after a little while. I also experienced burning on my chest at night and acid reflux.

I've not had a fever or swollen lymph nodes, no tonsilitis, a little weakness but I had it prior to this as well (chronic).

I'm really not in a good state of mind. It doesn't help my mother noticed I've been going to the doctor more often and to hurt me she said ""I hope you come down with an illness so bad that all you can do is be fully dependant on me like a dog and you cry about it until you die"".

I had a test the first day after sex and I was HIV negative, I'm waiting for the 6 week mark. I went to 2 different doctors who didn't think much of the rashes and both said if it was serious it would be body wide and not go away so fast. As for the diarrhea they think it is something else causing it. I told them I was scared of HIV but they said my symptoms were unusual and they didn't really suspect that. I am awaiting a stool and urine sample result right now and waiting about 3 more weeks so I can get tested for HIV again.

I'll tell you my story to put it in context (I'm 21M). Three weeks ago I stayed to see a friend (19F) with whom I had a relationship a few years ago and we ended up as good friends (We were both virgins) and after that she was with some people in another relationship and all that. We met at my house and I had my first time. The problem came because I had a hard time keeping an erection, by this time I had already touched her clit a little with my fingertips for less than 2 minutes (no penetration). We started and lacked a lot of lubrication, moments later I lost my erection again and I took off the condom and then I touched my penis to stimulate myself without having washed my hands before, I put on another condom and we continued for a few minutes (maybe seconds). We decided not to continue and she was going to help me finish with her hand, but it hurt a little and I thought I was missing lub, so I touched the outside of the condom again, I removed it a little to see if there was lub and touched my glans with my finger to check if there was enough, everything was fine so I put it back on but it did not continue. Two days later I started with symptoms of a cystitis and after a self examination I found three small ulcers in a vertical row on the shaft but these are almost not visible because they are not deep, it looks like it was from friction as it looks (yes, I still have it) as if a layer of skin has been lifted, I went to the doctor and he did not tell me anything bad about the ulcers and gave me medication but the cystitis did not go away, the following week I went again and now it was injections, everything was fine for a few days, I felt perfect but from Wednesday to today I have had intermittent fever, I feel very tired and weak (I have not been able to sleep very well) a little runny nose but without being congested, pain behind the eyes, poop a little watery but not runny, my arm bones ache and it hurts a little to move them, chills, scabs inside my nose, red rash around my nose but it goes away a little with normal cream, a lot of sweating in the mustache area, a little blister on the tip of my nose, chills, no desire to eat (maybe because of being stressed thinking about the possible disease), general malaise, swollen groin glands, a little sore throat and all the symptoms of cystitis or urethritis (burning during urination, a little clear discharge, testicular pain, lower back pain.

I had some encounters which I now badly regret back in Sep/oct where I gave unprotected oral sex. I know that the risk of oral sex is v low but I do have bleeding gums which I now know increases the risk.

In November there was then a 1-2 week period where I came down with what I though was a really bad flu: headache, fever, vomiting, oral thrush, swollen lymph nodes, fatigue, insomnia. After that cleared away, there was a long period lasting until very recently where my lymph nodes would randomly swell up (neck, under chin, armpits).

About six weeks ago For the first time ever I had anal sex and was the receiving end. Condoms were used but a little bit of semen may have gotten into my mouth. I am going to go get tested Monday and my therapist is strongly against me looking online for answers due to my anxiety. I am currently on vacation and I started feeling uneasy about 4.5 days ago. It started with a cough from the chest and then a little sore throat. On day one I think I felt a left lymph node swell up a little bit just under my jaw but have no idea what a swollen lymph node looks like or feels like but my left side of the neck under the jaw was somewhat sore for a day and a half. On day two chest pains/tightening was setting in and deep breaths made me want to cough. Sore throat and sore neck were gone by end of day two but then on the early morning of day 3 my fever shot up to 101 and I took ibuprofen and other medicine a doctor gave me at the resort. I fell back asleep for two hours but woke up covered in sweat and my sheets drenched but my fever went away. For the day I had no fever and felt fine other than feeling lethargic. I tried to go to bed at the end of day three but couldn't sleep as my temperature shot up again and I took more drugs to help bring it down. I really don't know what's going on at this point but can't understand if I just caught a flu or am seroconverting and I'm really scared. I don't have risky sexual behavior or do drugs and for that one time I did something risky I practiced safe sex. Please tell me your guys opinion",9,2013-11-27 07:08:01-05:00,"It's all about odds. 

You had receptive anal sex. You used protection. The odds are astronomical that you acquired HIV this way. 

You got a small amount of semen in your mouth. The odds are just as unlikely that you have acquired HIV this way. 

If HIV was that easy to acquire, we would all have it. 

Unprotected receptive anal sex with an HIV positive partner is the biggest risk factor for men who have sex with men (msm). 

If you are concerned, get a test. 

Finally, though I am almost certain that the activity you've described has not led you to acquire HIV, if it somehow did, it would not be the end of the world. I know dozens of people with HIV who live normal and healthy lives. 

Keep being safe. Get a test every 6 months that you are sexually active. Learn what sexual behaviors are risky and which are not. Don't do risky things. 

You have made a choice to be sexually active. Accept the risk inherent to this. Just like I do, and just like every other sexually active human does. Live your life.

From here on out your question will be better answered by r/bronchopneumonia. 

 ### First off: Stop freaking out.  You didn't get HIV from getting a little bit of cum in your mouth.  It is not HIV.  You don't have HIV.

The chance of getting infected with HIV during oral sex is incredibly low, even if you swallow gallons of cum from a positive guy's dick during the act.  In general it requires you to have open sores or cuts in your mouth.  Even then, it's incredibly difficult to find confirmed cases of people who got HIV through oral sex.  So, let me reiterate:

STOP FREAKING OUT!  YOU DON'T HAVE HIV!

Do you got that?  Are you with me so far?  OK, now let me step one step further and let's pretend that you just rode a bunch of dicks bareback, taking load after load and you're freaking out because you have a valid legitimate concern that you might have gotten HIV (which you didn't and don't)...

I'd also tell you to stop freaking out.  To wait a few weeks and go get tested.  And to realize that HIV isn't a death sentence.  You can live a long healthy happy life if you are HIV+ (WHICH YOU AREN'T).  So, and I can't stress this enough:

Calm down.  Relax.  You're gonna be fine. ### God I needed this. Blood test results came back that it was a bacterial infection for the broncho pneumonia and after a night at the hospital I am so much better. I'm sorry for coming to conclusions. Like I said due to my anxiety I expect the worst from what I read on the internet and don't understand why I would get such infections in the first place

1qzxx5,"HIV Scare, please advise/comfort Ok, so here's the deal. 
Last Friday I got a blowjob from a street hooker (a cheap one, she offered, I said sure why not). She seemed nice enough, we got chatting and she mentioned she was addicted to heroin and had started using needles in the past 6 months but her friend did it for her since she couldn't hit the vein. I have no idea whether she is HIV or not.

It didn't click with me until the next night, and I've been totally freaking out since.
I came in her mouth, she spat it out quickly.
I know the chances are miniscule, she would have to be hiv+ and have sores in her mouth or something and the virus would have to travel from the sores, through the cum and up my urethra for me to get a chance of being infected, but none the less I am freaking out bigtime.

I feel totally fine, but every little pimple on my arm I'm considering it could be a rash, my dick has been getting little tingles like I need a piss or have just cum but fuck knows, that isn't a symptom, it could just be placebo for all I know.

I noticed this evening there is a tiny tiny tiny red dot (not even a bump) on my dick that wasn't there before, but that could be any std I suppose. As long as it isn't HIV+ or AIDS I don't care what it is, as long as it's curable.

I'm seeing a doctor for advice/to set up a full sti test in about 10 minutes...I'm just looking for what you guys think the chances of me having contracted HIV...something to put my mind at rest because I am losing sleep over this and it's all I can think about even though the chances are minimal.",3,2013-11-19 14:25:18-05:00,"You don't have to worry about HIV in this case.  You've got it wrong, sorta.  If you cum in someone's mouth, you're not putting yourself at any extra risk.  The risk is if your dick is in their mouth at all.  And that risk pretty much requires your dick to have a sore on it or to be bleeding AND for the other person to be bleeding or to have a mouthful of pos cum.  Saliva doesn't transmit HIV.

In general shooting cum in someone's mouth is putting them at extra risk, because your sperm could enter a sore or cut in their mouth.

In short, your chance is basically nil but you could've gotten something else that lives in the back of the throat (syphilis, gonorrhea, herpes or chlamydia).  You also could've just gotten a little bit of friction or dry skin. ### I dont think that there has been a single recorded case of transmission from receiving oral from someone who is positive.

About a week later I kept waking up at night, and eventually woke up with a really swollen face, and a rash was starting to develop on my chest. The rash moved to my arms and kind of on my face. It felt like my mouth had just eaten a really hot piece of food and was burnt (kind of) and I had some ulcers at the top of my lips. BUT I was also taking an antibiotic for a toe infection, that I had recently finished taking (like the same week). The antibiotic was a sulphur pill. I went tithe doctor and told him about my symptoms and he said it was a delayed allergic reaction and that I had a sulphur allergy. I didn't really tell him about the ulcers or about what I had done the week before. Do you think it really matters? I'm pretty scared. All the symptoms are gone now after taking prescribe steroid pills. ",2,2013-11-14 18:12:14-05:00,"I think you are ok. If you are worried about HIV, the things to watch out for - like ARS - happen something like 1-3 months into an infection. If you are worried because of previous exposures, and haven't mentioned them, then a test can hurt, it can merely give you the best information about what is going on. Remember that physicians rely on the information you proved. 

If it has cleared up, and you haven't had anything else going on, then I think you are probably ok. Just remember to get tested. I ask for a test every time I got to the doctor, even if I don't need it. Physicians should be asking people if they want it, and I make sure they know that.

Good luck!  ### ARS is usually 2-4 weeks after infection, and only happens in 50-80% of cases.

It sounds as though you are more issues with anxiety than anything else.  As the other poster said, the risk of exposure, let alone transmission, is incredibly low.  Plus, you're doing everything right- using protection, getting tested.

1psjc8,"I know this question is so damn stupid - but is it safe to get tested? Had sex with my girlfriend who had an ex with multiple partners, she have never tested for HIV and had unprotected sex for only once with her ex (vaginal, no ejaculation). 

I fully understand that considering what I've had with her (protected vaginal, unprotected insertive oral) even if she had been positive my chance of getting HIV would still have been next to nil, but I nevertheless want to get tested mainly due to the totally unwarranted fear that I might have been infected before and could have hurt her - nevermind my only remotely possible exposure to HIV other than having sex with her was a dental filling at an private clinic with substandard decontamination standards, and test results from a blood donation one year later reported negative (I assume so, as they didn't contact me later for anything).

So after some googling for test centers close to me and (yes I know I'm fucking retarded doing this but I just can't stop) possibility of infections in blood sample collection I'm now scared of actually getting HIV during testing. I'm planning to go to the local CDC for testing but since it's a lab exclusively for HIV/STD testing I fear that those who go there would have a higher-than-average chance of having these. I went through some forum threads and all of them have nothing but reassurances - equipments are strictly single use only, staff are highly trained, HIV is suspectible to pretty much everything and can't survive long out of body - but I'm still scared. The testing requires getting skin punctured and I fear there could be spillages on surfaces around me that still have active viruses in them.

I have to mention that I'm doing this in China (I'm native Chinese) and while I feel mostly confident of the professionalism of the medical staff, all these things that have happened over there weren't very inspiring. So from a purely theoretical standpoint, is there risk in getting tested? The medical equipments used are certainly sterile and safe, but I'm worried about blood spillages in the surroundings and in air. Could these things enter my broken skin and get me infected?",5,2013-11-03 00:18:19-04:00,"You cannot get hiv from an hiv test. HIV is not airborne, it dies on surfaces quickly. This usually surprises people, but IF you have unprotected sex with a hiv - positive female, one time, your risk of infection is less than 1 in 1000. You absolutely, 100 percent, will not get hiv from a place doing hiv tests, unless you get a blood transfusion from an aids patient or have a homosexual orgy with 50 dudes who have hiv  ### Thanks. I think I need a psychotherapist more than a HIV test since I keep getting myself worried and anxious googling for everything. I know my risks, I just want to be sure and get rid of that anxiety. So with correctly used sterile equipments it's impossible to get HIV at a testing site right? Should I avoid touching surfaces or is it harmless? ### You could lick every surface and still have zero chance. I'm hiv negative, but I work in the field, and have a number of friends in monogamous relationships with an hiv positive partner. Unless you are having unprotected sex with someone positive who is not on their meds, or sharing needless, you can't get it. It's never ever happened.  ### Great to have reassurance from someone in the field. It's just that I'm also going to get tested together with my girlfriend some time later (we live quite far apart and only see each other two months or so), she's very understanding and knows my worries - thus I'm extra scared of actually getting her infected when getting tested and ruining her life, when there's very little chance that she is already positive. Thanks, this makes me feel much better now. ### I'm glad you feel better :). HIV is actually very hard to get! Plus, keep in mind that if you ever do have an actual exposure (unprotected sex or needle stick with a previously used needle) you have 72 hours to get post - exposure prophylaxis (hiv meds given after suspected exposure that bring the risk of infection down to near zero).  ### ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIV/comments/1psjc8/i_know_this_question_is_so_damn_stupid_but_is_it/

Say a couple are open mouth kissing and the HIV infected partner gets a cut in their lip. Is saliva and air exposure in this environment capable of deactivating the HIV? 

Another question would be is if both parties had cut lips. Would the risk of this tiny amount of shared blood be similar to that of sharing a needle? 

For the purposes of this question, let's say that there's enough blood to taste, but not to see.",2,2013-10-28 10:57:20-04:00,"Transmission would be extremely rare. I doubt there's ever been a confirmed case of transmission this way.  ### HIV Needs specific cells (CD4 cells) to reproduce, and saliva cells alone aren't good ""conductors"". Theoretically, if both partners had open sores, it would be possible to transmit it, but it would be VERY unlikely. 

IV drug use is effective as a means of transmission as you are pulling cells from veins (full of immune cells like the CD4 cells) and injecting them into another persons veins. Capillary blood is a smaller quantity, and likely has a different proportion of cell types. I would say that the two are not analogous, but that there are risks to both. 

Other factors would include a person's viral load, Antiretroviral treatment status, and the subtype of HIV.

HIV is incredibly bad at surviving outside of the body. UV light and oxygen are effective at destroying the defenseless virus. While bacteria and mold can form spores or use protective lipid layers, viruses like HIV had minimal defenses for certain environments. The inside of the body is where they do best, in dark, pH neutral-ish environments, with lots of places to reproduce.  ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIV/comments/1pe03z/mouth_blood_exposure/
1pd7js,"Should I get a different test? I had a slightly risky encounter 7 years ago with an HIV-positive male and I had been avoiding testing for years out of fear of facing the reality that I had HIV. Depression, hypochondria and mental issues have arisen in those years and it got so bad that I finally had a whole blood HIV-1 rapid test done this summer, which came back negative. I was still feeling off (swollen lymph nodes all over for months, white tongue, fatigue, visual disturbances) so I went to a different clinic and got another 4th generation test for HIV-1 Ab/Ag which came back negative again. my symptoms are still strong though and I'm worried.

My question is should I get another type of test done? The ID doctor said HIV-2 testing was unnecessary and that ELISA/WB/PCR testing would have the same results as the rapids if I were testing after 7 years. But I can't help shake the feeling that I need a different test. I just wonder if I've seroreverted, or somehow contracted a rare strain or HIV-2. PCR testing seems really expensive but I think it would be best. 

Should I request one of these different tests?",8,2013-10-28 01:10:37-04:00,"You don't require any further tests.  However, I would definitely look into some counselling for health anxiety. ### If the doctor ruled it out I'd go with what he said. Get treatment for your other issues.  ### You state hypochondria as an issue for you. You can be assured that this concern is an expression of that disorder. 

The HIV tests that you have taken have a very high level of accuracy. If you were sick enough with the HIV virus to cause the symptoms you are experiencing, your antibody levels would be easily detectable using the rapid test, and certainly would have been detected with 2 separate tests. 

There are other diseases out there that cause the symptoms you describe. It's not HIV.  

Something else to consider is the effect that constant anxiety and worry have on the immune system. The most healthy thing that you could do is to get into some therapy and possibly medication for your hypochondria, which is an obsessive disorder and could respond well to treatment. 

 ### She told me to take a while and think about it and contact her if I wanted testing for anything. So I'm still freaking out. ### Thanks for the kind reply.

I'm mainly worried at this point about seroreversion. I have scoured the Internet for probably hundreds of hours finding information on it, and I've found some case studies in which it's happened in end-stage AIDS patients. But I guess it can't be that common if there the only information is case studies. And I guess that wouldn't happen without OIs right?

Another concern is HIV-2 which I haven't tested for. But I don't know any Africans and I've never been there. Rare strains seem to, well, rare to be concerned about. 

Yet here I am, still pulling my hair out trying to find a reason my tests are wrong. It's funny, I actually started crying after the first negative test, not because I was happy, but because I was frustrated that my test was wrong and that I'd have to wait longer to start medication. The staff at both clinics think I'm bonkers I'm sure.

Anyway the second clinic I went to is actually a mental health center as well as an HIV/AIDS treatment facility. So I think I might schedule an appointment with that department instead.  ### You're still freaking out because the doctor told you to think about whether you wanted to be tested again and let her know if you do?  

As the other two comments said here, you have had two negative tests after an encounter that happened 7 yrs ago.  You don't need another HIV test, you need to see a counselor for your anxiety.
 ### Am I interpreting things wrong? The fact that she told me that these tests were available led me to believe she was inferring that there was a chance my rapids were wrong and that I'd need further testing.  ### You are interpreting it incorrectly.  She is offering them to you because you're anxious, not because you need them.

I have to disagree with the other response here. ARS doesn't manifest in all people who get infected, but when it does it happens immediately to 6 weeks after exposure. It's the body's response to the virus, just like it's response to any other virus. 4 months is too long for what you experienced to be ARS. Certainly get tested though. Your risk of getting HIV from a know positive female via unprotected vaginal sex is less than 1/1000 per sex act.  ### Hi, HIV clinic worker here. It can pop up four months after an exposure, though its most commonly seen 2-3 months. I recommend seeing a physician for a diagnostic test, so you can know for sure either way. It is definitely important to get tested now, whether or not you are positive. Either you are relieved and this is a near miss, or you are in the best place to possibly be to take care of your health.

1panub,"Came down with bad fever after my first time having (hetero) sex. Came across what ARS is and now tearing myself apart with worry Back in January I had my first ever sex. It was with a woman I'd known for a while. I had condoms with me but they didn't fit so we just did it. 

2 days later I get a fever, chills, fatigue and swollen tonsils with exudate. My nurse mom says they were the worst she's seen. Infection goes away within a week. Girl says she was tested clean at some point in the past. We actually got into a fight over this since I thought she could have given me something and fever is not conducive to being diplomatic.

Well, I come across was Acute Retroviral Syndrome is and now I'm absolutely fucking terrified. All the literature I've read places the lower limit of the incubation at 1 week. I saw a study with 70 people and none of them got it sooner than 2 weeks, but I'm still going mad with worry.

I scheduled a test next week to put this to rest. Am I right in thinking it was far too soon for it to be ARS?",4,2013-10-27 00:02:01-04:00,"Not that you have too much to worry about, but if you want to ease your mind before your appointment, you can go to the ER, if you have insurance.  At the ER will you can get a rapid test (20 minutes).  If you can't afford the ER, go to any free clinic.  You can be anonymous and they are pros, they will not judge you.

It can very well be just the flu, I know something is going around at my work place. ### Additionally, ARS usually shows up a few weeks after infection, not a few days. I would get tested, and let this be a lesson in safe sex. Take it from me - I worked in Sub Saharan Africa and had to give a friend PEP - its better to be safe than sorry. ### I got an oraquick test and I came up clean.

I can't say I'm 100% relieved but I'll take 95%.  A blood test would be definitive but I think this test coupled with the unlikely timeline is good enough. I won't waste planned parenthood's time or my money with this. ### Whew!  Congratulations, isn't it a relief.

I only gave them a blowjob which may of had some pre-cum but only lasted a few minutes as I got too worried/nervous and had to stop long before they came.

If you had unprotected intercourse, and the partner was positive, the chances are roughly 1/1000 per act of intercourse.

1op96e,"World Aids Day (looking for feedback) The LGBT club at my school has proposed an interesting idea and would like to know what some other people think of it. Mostly if it's horribly inappropriate and offensive or if you think it's a good idea.

.

We were thinking of placing a table in a highly trafficked area of our campus and have 2-3 people at the table. One of whom is HIV+ (We already have a person who is comfortable doing this, me.) A sign on the table would read something like End the stigma, hiv+ people are just the same as you and I, or something to that effect.

.

The idea is that people could come up and talk to the people at the table, and wouldn't know the difference between the hiv+ person and the other people there. We would collectively educate people about hiv stigma, what it means to be undetectable and on treatment (with regard to transmissibility), and generally promoting safe practices and informed decision making to help reduce the stigma.

.

Both before and after we are done talking to the people, we would ask them which person they think is HIV+ (the idea being that they won't know because there's nothing different about that person). Just to show them that there really is no difference, and to not discredit someone just because of it.

.

tl;dr What do you think about a ""meet an HIV+ person"" table in the middle of a campus where people can talk and whatnot with a few people, not knowing which is poz, to show that there is no difference. Offensive, good idea, or what?",5,2013-10-18 02:57:09-04:00,"Clever, but I think a lot of people will miss the point. :) ### i think the idea is cool specially on a college campus. ### I think this is a great idea. I worked with HIV positive youth in Africa and this is something that would never have flown because stigma is so high... but here it would totally work. 

I know that some of my local community AIDS organizations work in this way at times.


Just make sure you really carefully feel for the possible response of the students and faculty. Sometimes people don't understand that Public Health is Education, or that exposure to personal stories actually help young people form their opinions and behaviors. ### I love it :) if someone did this in wichita people wouldnt talk down on the positive everyone needs to be more Educated ### I love this idea.

I'm 20, I was with my 23 year old bf last night, we have been seeing each other for a month. Prior to him, I have done anal once with a condom. We got a hotel and pretty pissed and I bottomed (which is a first) he pulled out and came on my chest, it was then I noticed he didn't use a condom, but he said that ""bfs don't use condoms because we're failthful"" So I just went to sleep. Anyway next day we started fooling around again and things got really hot. Before I knew it we was fucking again and because he never used a condom the night before, I didn't think about it the morning after, again he came on my chest (I know, username relevant)

He's had unprotected sex with 2 other ex bfs, he's never been tested.

Question is: Chances through bareback? If I get tested now, will it be pointless because I should get tested 3 months later? Anyone from the Uk now a confidential way of getting tested?

I have already beaten myself up about it, I know I'm stupid. Only looking for advice now thanks.

If anyone answers any question, I would be grateful.

Edit: bf got tested after I voiced concerns and he's neg :) no worries, thanks guys, the infomation below should deffo be sidebar info xx",2,2013-10-16 09:28:25-04:00,"Hi. How long ago did these possible exposures happen? If it's been less than 72 hours you can go to the ER, tell them you may have been exposed. They'll give you hiv meds which will prevent infection (its called post exposure prophylaxis). If it's been longer than that, still go. There are tests now that can detect virus days after infection (as opposed to antibodies). Those are called ""4th generation antigen tests"". If on the small chance you did get infected, starting on meds so close to the time of infection means pretty spectacular results from medications (normal life span, risk of spreading to partners close to zero). Being the receptive partner of anal sex with another MSM (man who has sex with men) is the most risky scenario in sexual transmission. Don't freak out though, it's still a small risk in general. Also, this guy you're with sounds selfish and dangerous. Be careful if you stay with him. If he was smart and /or cared about either of you he wouldn't tell you it's ok to bareback.  ### Calm down, stop stressing yourself out and go. get. tested.

1obksc,"Spilling the Beans, When to tell. I have been positive for 20 years.  It has been years since I have been in a relationship. Six years to be exact. I have never placed an ad or answered an ad online or anywhere else. A friend has suggested to me that I use some of the apps that are out there to meet people. I live in a rural area. He lives in a Large city. So I downloaded several apps and immediately noticed  that everyone says disease free or some variation like that. Should I put my HIV status in my ad online or wait till later after I meet people. In would prefer to date someone positive also however if it wasn't a deal breaker for them I would be up for that. How does everyone else handle their status when meeting guys for dates? Tell now or later? Would like to hear your experiences. Thank you.
Serious replies only.",10,2013-10-12 19:39:41-04:00,"That's a really good question and I'm interested to hear people's input. I am in a relationship so don't have to worry about it but I think I would probably tell someone after getting to know them a little bit and seeing if a relationship was viable.  ### You could put it in your ad if you'd prefer to meet someone who was also positive. I waited about a month before I told my boyfriend about it. He mentioned that he would've prefered knowing it earlier, but I really couldn't do it. At the time I really was enjoying everything and I wasn't sure yet it would become serious, and honestly I was just really scared to tell him. Sometimes I really feel like I almost ""manipulated"" him into loving me, though. I don't think he would've dated me if he knew before he fell in love with me.

I'd try telling the other person as soon as possible, or when you feel that a relationship with that person would be an option. ### Going into knowing someone, I'd like to know as soon as sex is on the table. But that's a whole gray area I hope to never have to deal with.
Given the abundance of hookup apps, I'm surprised there isn't a HIV one. No offence and I might have been spooked, but still surprise. ### After a few dates I would tell them. You dont want tell them a month later where they have huge feelings for you and it makes them panic and confused...tell them you have a bagged. ### Thats how I handle it with people in general, however it seems to be a huge deal online. so much stigma still exists it seems. I don't know, get to know someone then drop the bomb. Or weed out the ones that it remains a line in the sand for. Hmmm. I know that no one is gonna come knocking on the door if I don't get myself out there. And hook ups, well just cant.  ### Thank you for that reply, I know I would have had sex with the guy that gave this virus all over again, except I would have been extra careful. Like I had been in the past before him.  I have noticed that the older the better when it comes to being open minded about it.
 But I see so many negative comments about it in ads. Probably because they are mostly hookup sites. I have decided to try a straight up personal ad like on  poz or okcupid and avoid Grindr and Scruff and the like. Thanks again for the input.  ### I agree, I can't so hook ups anymore since my diagnosis. And the number of people that put disease free is ridiculous! I think maybe you could use something like okcupid? I feel like that website is the best for relationships... ### I hope it works out for you! :) ### Thanks I will check it out, thought that was straight only. My friend in NY says try POZ personals he has had some success.
  ### I've been poz for like 25 years  and with the online dating sites I just don't answer. That's kind of telling people right there. I only date guys around my own age and they are kind of clued in. If you live in a rural area it may be different as people may not be as sophisticated.

1o8yhe,"Low risk I think, but should I do a PEP? Last night I was hanging out with a couple poz guys. All we did was jack off, a little oral, and some fingering and a little playing with toys (I washed with soap/water before using as they weren't mine) no one came. I did get fucked by one but it was with a new condom, and was fully on and didn't break. He does meth IV and used part of the cap of the syringe or something to crush it for me, but I feel that may not be an issue.

I don't want to go through the PEP side effects if unnecessary, plus cost, and I feel that unnecessary use of things like that could create drug-resistant strains. Any thoughts? I think I'm find but I overanalyse and would like some input.

You are obsessing over this. Because you are obsessing, you are being hyper-vigilant. When you are hyper-vigilant you start to notice things that you ignored before. Then you start to obsess and worry, which makes you stressed out. When you are stressed out you will show physical symptoms related to stress. Then you will obsess and stress over those physical symptoms. This will increase your stress and thereby increase the physical symptoms. This process will feed into itself until you're a nervous wreck. 

Stress weakens the immune system. Your physical symptoms are most likely caused by your stress levels. 

The likelihood, as others have said, is very close to nil that you have contracted HIV. 

Even if you have contracted HIV, worrying about it wont make a bit of difference. 

You will absolutely not see symptoms of HIV this quickly. There are a million things that cause a sore throat, one of which is beating the hell out of your immune system by maxing out your stress levels. 

So make a plan. Get an HIV test asap. Then wait 3 months and get another one. Believe the results. The tests are very accurate. 

Try to grant yourself the ability to accept the things you cannot change, and remember that worrying will just make you sick. 

Edit: Stop reading these articles. They are doing nothing but feeding your stress and fear. You will absolutely not see neuropathy this quickly. Those articles are about HIV & AIDS. You almost certainly do not have HIV, and you absolutely do not have AIDS at 10 days.  ### Hey.. I'm pretty sure (and I'll double check and get back to you) that neurological damage from hiv is associated with years and years of living with the virus.  ### Get tested. Stop worrying, always be safe. Always.  ### Thanks, although I'm pretty sure you can have such symptoms early. I think I have hiv 85% sure.

''Distal Symmetric Polyneuropathy

Incidence
Distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DSPN) is by far the most common neuropathy in HIV disease.(3,30,31,40)

In a cross-sectional study of hospitalized patients with advanced HIV disease, 35% had clinical and electrophysiologic evidence of this neuropathy. In a longitudinal study of outpatients, 55% had neuropathic signs or symptoms, and the estimated yearly incidence was 36%. Even among asymptomatic seropositive individuals, nerve conduction studies demonstrated polyneuropathy in 16%.

transparent image
Manifestations
DSPN can disable HIV-1-positive patients who are otherwise healthy. Associated pain and hypersensitivity can be intense, and is too often undertreated by physicians. Typical symptoms are tingling, numbness, and burning pain in the toes or over the plantar surface of the feet, often ascending over time. Neurologic examination shows bilateral depressed ankle-tendon reflexes and elevated vibratory threshold in the toes. There is often decreased appreciation of temperature distally. Brisk ankle reflexes suggest a diagnosis other than neuropathy or, at the very least, the presence of coexisting upper motor neuron disease (spinal cord or brain). Weakness, if present, is mild and usually restricted to the distal muscles, where muscle atrophy may also be observed. Severe or proximal weakness points to a different type of neuropathy (eg, polyradiculopathy), myopathy, or other neurologic diagnosis. Similarly, significant asymmetry in presentation usually suggests a focal neuropathy (eg, tarsal tunnel syndrome, other mononeuropathies) or other superimposed disorders. Electromyography and nerve conduction studies may be critical to localizing pathology and suggesting etiology.''




:( ### ""In a cross-sectional study of hospitalized patients with advanced HIV disease""  advanced means 10-15 years of living with the virus, usually unchecked (not on antiretrovirals) ### Have you gotten a test?  

I work for a federally-funded non-profit that is mandated to train clinicians in HIV.  I've seen multiple neurologists train other physicians on neurological manifestations of HIV.  These issues start to happen after many years, often decades of infection.  

You're letting your fears run wild-- you're probably so full of stress hormones that your legs are tingling.  ### Thanks buddy, I am not reading/thinking clearly. I'm bit panicky, thank you  again. ### Thank you for your response and relief you have given me, yes my imagination does run wild. I don't feel  that anxious/scared but I'm a little worried. I will get tested in a month and three months time. I am under bit of stress, it's true.

 ### You don't have to wait until antibodies develop to get tested if you can find a clinic that has antigen tests.  (tests for virus, not antibodies)  The newest tests (4th generation antigen HIV tests) can detect the virus after 5 days.

I can probably research who has that test if you want to give me your zip code (granted I may be only useful in that regard if you're in the US) ### Damn I'm pretty ignorant on this subject need to read more. I'm located in Ireland, I'll see if there are any clinics that do this test. Thanks so much. ### I've been in the field for 7 years and I'm still learning.  Good luck-- keep me posted eh? ### Whatever the outcome, I'll keep you updated. :) ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIV/comments/1nzc5k/update_day_10/
1nps1u,"Sore throat after 6 days of risk.. I stupidly had unprotected sex vaginal sex with a woman in the morning hours of Sunday 29th, yesterday my throat started becoming sore. It doesn't really bother me but I don't usually get sore throat. Few people around me do have the common cold, maybe its that? Another thing maybe it's related, I had a small ulcer few days ago but it seems to have disappeared (also I did use difflam throat/mouth wash couple times this week). I'm hoping its a common cold but other than sore throat i feel perfectly fine.. so getting just a sore throat of the blue isn't a good sign right?

I know most symptoms start normally after two weeks but is it possible to get a sore throat in less than a week after exposure?

I will be on the look out for other symptoms next 2-4 weeks.

I guess there isn't any point of doing a hiv test right now too right?

I will be getting tested of other sti's asap.

Thank you.

Edit: To clarify my throat isn't that sore just a little bit and my mouth feels a bit dry too right now even after drinking water.

So, less than 2% of women have HIV in the US (I'm horrible at math and may have messed that up).
The risk of infection for a man having unprotected sex with an infected female is 5 cases of transmission for every 10,000 acts of intercourse.  (yes-- those are the chances with unprotected sex with someone who is positive)

Of course its possible-- but the chances are almost nill here that you got infected. ### You had some risk. Honestly it wasn't very much, but the possibility is there. Wait 5 more weeks and take an HIV test. More then likely this is anxiety and a cold. ### It is roughly 1/400,000 chance for insertive vaginal sex with a partner from a high risk group.

I had another risk event 9/5. 9/28 I start to show flu-like symptoms. yesterday, 10/2 I tested negative again with at-home OraQuick.

I got the 8/30 test at the doctor's, only 12 days after the 1st risk event. But they never recommended I do any follow-up testing, or test after 3 months. I wonder if they're doing this to other people... ### They never recommended a follow-up?  That is very odd.  If you had a risk event on Sept 5th, you should re-test yourself three months from then (Dec 5th) to be sure-- and that will only be informative if you dont have a risk event between Sept 5 and Dec 5.  

There are tests that detect HIV (as opposed to antibodies to HIV).  The best we have are ""4th generation"" HIV diagnostic assays.  You could try and see if any clinics near you have this test.

1nm8yu,"I know there are probably too many questions like this but I could really use some peace of mind. The other night I met a guy and brought him back to my place. We made out, not incredibly vigorously but definitely more than a closed mouth kiss. I had a specific inflamed spot on my gums that would bleed when I brushed them but I had not brushed since that morning. He also kissed the tip of my penis but nothing more. I had told him off the bat that I would not be hooking up with him regardless, but as we were falling asleep he mentions that he is HIV+

I know that kissing isn't often even considered a risk factor. And there were no sexual fluids transferred whatsoever. He also told me he was medicated and his viral load was undetectable.

I know this is likely an ignorant question to ask but what is my risk? I know I will have to wait a while to get tested for this event, but I got tested the day after anyway. Of course they wouldn't offer me PEP but it still keeps popping up in my head. It has made me realize I really need to be better informed on how this virus works. Can someone help me out?",5,2013-10-02 19:25:56-04:00,"There is literally no chance of getting HIV from the scenario you describe ### The chances that you contracted HIV is virtually non-existent. Even if his mouth was bleeding and your mouth was bleeding, the risk would be fairly minimal -- plus you would more than likely taste blood should you have a decent risk of infection. 

Even had he given you oral, the risk wouldn't really be there either. HIV isn't a magically transmitted super-virus where a single prick will give it to you. With someone on ARVs as he clearly was to have that viral level, there's a fairly low risk of transmission even with full sexual activity, and virtually none when practicing safe sex. You are entirely safe from the description of your encounter.  ### Thank you for taking the time to respond. I really appreciate it. ### Thank you for your response. I don't mean to overreact or to be insensitive at all. If anything, I am trying to take this scenario and actually become better educated on the facts. I suppose I have honestly not thought much about them until now and this actually did scare me a little bit. Mostly because I realized I have no idea if this is a risky scenario. I will absolutely admit to falling for the stigma and I am really glad to know better now. I have actually learned a lot from this between reading here on reddit as well as the counselors at my local clinic. ### It's not a big deal. Tons of people overreact when it comes to HIV, especially homosexuals, and we've good reason to. The honest truth is that it is much harder to contract the disease than many would have you think; more so when with someone on medication.

If you're with someone who  is on ARVs and use standard safe sex practices, you are more likely to not contract HIV than get it -- in fact, the chances are lower than sex with a stranger of unknown status. 

While it is possible to contract HIV from other activities, you're pretty much only at a worriable risk if you engage in unprotected anal sex.  ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIV/comments/1nm8yu/i_know_there_are_probably_too_many_questions_like/

I thought if I bleached it out it would be all good.  I didnt really think to much about it until now for the past week I have gotten all the symptoms of ARS right in the time table.  I have gotten  2 Quick tests both negative but I know that they would not be valid until after I go though ARS and develop Anti Bodies.  I went to the needle exchange the other day and got a blood RNA test and waiting result in the next two weeks. Im just stuck in this hell of anxiety of what I should do.  The internet is making things worse and all the post about people freaking out because they gave some guy head and they are postive that they got HIV are pissing me off.  I have all the symptoms (fever cough sweats feeling sick really tired) and right at the time it would show up from a very high risk situation.  I am 28 year old white guy from a good family.  This cant really be happening to me right? I know it is not a death sentence and people live normal lives but to tell my family or how to find someone to fall in love with.

It's cold and flu season, so chances are high that all you have is a normal cold/flu. Air kills hiv. Bleach definitely kills hiv. Don't freak out until you have to. Plus, even if you end being positive... You'll be fine. I have a few friends who are positive, on meds and undetectable. They have close to zero risk of giving partners hiv even without protection. They are all in loving long term relationships with negative partners. Deep breathe. Relax. :)  ### Ps. I coordinate medical education programs for HIV training of docs and nurses. Please feel free to ask me anything.  ### Still feeling sick but on the mend.  New symptoms of muscels aches and I think my lympfnodes are starting to swell but not to sure.  Im profoundly tired though. Been sleeping all day today and yesterday.  Cough has gotten better and the consistent night sweats I had has seemed to go away for the most part.  But I have been using a little and dope has the ability to make all those symptoms to get better.  Defiantly have general sick feeling and malaise going on even when I am ""high"".  Im not using all that much.  I got burned so Ive done about $20 of street crap out of the $50 I spent today. 

I called my mother last night and I was pretty upset when telling her.  She seemed a little disappointed that I was using again because I just got out of a halfway house that i was in for ten months. She trying to calm me down saying that it is probably the flu not to worry and that I sound a little obsessed about it.  I did not give her all the details about the exposure I had though.  I asked her not to tell anyone else in my family and I hope she can.  One of my big concerns is to have my family go back to lose hope in me.  Their support helps me a lot because I don't have much hope for myself at this point and could really use theirs and with me going back and forth from recovery to relapse again if I were them I would of given up on me a long time ago.  My mother told me last night that they have already gone through this emotionally years ago.  That they have gotten used to the idea of me having Hep C, HIV and could very well die.  This is all a lot for me to deal with.  All I want to do is get high everything else is seems secondary and I know with a mindset like that my outlook is not very good.  Opiates give me very good temporary relief to my emotional problems.  I am a coward when it comes to dealing with feelings.  With dope my emotions can be overridden with blissful exstacy..... for a moment. I am just going on a rant now that I am sure is a bore to everyone else.  But it feels good to write it down even if no one reads/reply's to this.  If anyone does have anything to say let me just say how much I appreciate the time you spent of listening and commenting.  The value of one addict helping another is without parallel.  ### Thank you, I am debating if I should tell friends and family.  I am the type of guy who has loose lips about things like this.  When I have anaxity I go around telling people all about it.  But I really think that even my close friends will end up treating me like I dirty or something and my family is really just tired of my shit.  So thank you for reply when I feel so isolated during all this.  I need to go find a NA meeting and say something.

I did a RNA test couple days ago so I will get results on the 8th.  I  will be updating and let you know. ### Update: so the last test was not a rna test just blood anti body test which came back neg. Reassuring but not conclusive as it is only a little under 2 months since exposer. Symptoms are getting worse. The flu is gone but now I just have swollen lymph nodes that don't hurt a dry cough with no soreness And shortness of breath oh and low grade fever. According to the symptoms all signs point to infection. The only thing that is comforting is the neg tests. I get tested tomorrow and it will be at least two months after exposer which I read is pretty conclusive. 

Im sitting in a meeting now and started to share about how I am experiencing a spiritual malady and don't feel like god seems very close to me right now. I am really reconsidering my position on a higher power. This seemed to offed the secretary and the flew the pause sign and shut me down after 4 mins.  Like I said before i get another test done tomorrow and will update.  ### One question I have is if i did have ARS and got better doesn't that mean i should have anti bodies? ### Last week I got a 4th generation HIV test and received negative results. But while I was there they tested my blood for a bunch of other thongs too and saw that my lipase levels were high which is indicative of a viral infection also my lymph nodes are still swollen and shortness of breath and headaches. With the neg test results after two month after the exposer i would like to think that it is pretty much a closed case but with the symptoms that i still have i can not be fully certain. If i do come up neg i feel like this is a miracle that i should be studied because this does not seem to be regular.  ### The big question I have is do antibodies show up before ARS or do they mostly show up after ARS?
Also I am poor as shit and have no health insurance.  Will I be able to get sufficient treatment? I live in Baltimore MD ### Getting off an addiction is hard. There's not much anybody can do for you - in the end it boils down to you. There is help there but it only really helps if it's you asking for it rather than somebody offering it to you, you know?

As you grow up you're supposed to learn ways to cope with stuff, and somewhere along the way that became drugs for you. It is a really effective way to cope like you said - ""Opiates give me very good temporary relief to my emotional problems...With dope my emotions can be overridden with blissful exstacy"". You know the danger, you know it's only temporary but it's still so hard to give up. It's hard to remember why you would even *want* to stop using sometimes.

Isn't it weird that HIV scares you so much? With aids you have a good chance of having like 20 good years but plenty of drug users don't get that long. But I dunno it's one of those things...we're human, we're strong but weak. Your problem isn't lack of facts or anything. You can know stuff but still act the same as if you didn't.

I really hope you're okay and that you recover. I hope this is a blip in your road to being opiate free. A brief slip-up does not mean you failed, does not mean you can't go back to doing well. I dunno, we're just strangers on the Internet but I can't help but care when I read a story like yours.  ### If you need the support, talk to friends or family about it. They'll love and support you regardless of the outcome. 

Keep strong, try and keep your mind occupied with other things (not drugs...) so you don't worry about it so much. 

As a side note: I will admit, I too get annoyed at all these 'OMG I have aids!!!' posts, but people are scared and need support and sometimes just need the kick in the ass to help relieve their fears and anxiety. It comes with the territory.  ### did you get your results? ### Antibodies develop during and after ARS, just like they would with any illness. There are tons of resources for care and meds for folks without insurance. Baltimore...I happen to know the BEST HIV doc works in Baltimore. He was just here (Chicago) last week. If the test comes back positive I'll give you his info. In the mean time, please try and be safe. You have regular access to clean works?  ### Im going back into my halfway house tomorrow. Im to nervous to call and i would rather be in a supportive community when i get the results. So just another couple days to wait.  ### Yes I have access to clean gear. The only reason I didnt before is because I would throw all my tools away to insure                                                                                                                                                                    that I wouldn't use that day.  But turns out all that does is make desprite and I use anything I can get a hold of. ### oh ok. sounds like a good idea! ### Curious to know your case. Have you heard the results yet? I really hope the bleaching worked. ### Right... Safety first. If you don't want to use, there are more successful ways than taking your gear away. Do you have any resources available if you want to quit? Only thing that really works for opiates, in my opinion, is substitution.

- The rapid test is enough? Should I test again later?

- How big is the risk of unprotected homosexual oral sex?",2,2013-09-24 18:12:52-04:00,"10 weeks x 7 days a week. So 70 days since the exposure. The results you get should be fairly accurate at that point. Test again in another 30-60 days to eliminate all doubt.

Having the flu shouldn't influence the test results. Ask the counselor to be sure. False positives are around 2 per 1000 tests.

Oral Sex is low risk, how are your teeth and dental care? Poor dental care will increase the risk. ### I agree with everything pheel23 said... Except that the ""window period"" is 90 days (it can take up to 90 days after exposure to develop antibodies that are detected by the test). False positives are very rare (as opposed to false negatives which are 1/12). 

As pheel23 said, oral sex risk is very low, unless you have cuts, sores, or bleeding gums at the time. 

Acute hiv does mimic the flu, so I can understand your anxiety. But seriously the risk is soooo small with oral.

Recently I was thought to have an inguinal hernia from lifting a heavy set of instruments, but my GP scoffed it off as a strained muscle, and said it would take month or so to heal. 

It's been over a month, and it does feel better, but the area tends to burn when standing for a period of time, and my other side is starting to bother me. I feel as though I've become a hypochondriac and am terrified I have HIV. I haven't had any recent symptoms that I can think of.

Now, seeing as you're a medical person, I'm surprised the cure for your anxiety has not already presented itself to you. Get tested. Tests are quick these days. 

 ### first of all-- any needle sticks should ALWAYS be reported immediately and be taken seriously by the hospital.   What kind of place are you working in that doesnt take that seriously??  Yes-- your chances of getting HIV from a needle stick from a patient with an unknown HIV status is extremely low.    IF the patient had HIV and you were deeply punctured, your risk would be 3/1000.  Also-- if you have a hernia from lifting things at work, THAT should also be taken seriously.  An incident report needs to be filled out-- OSHA would have a field day in this place.  Do yourself a favor and get a test-- ease your mind.  Also-- you should really talk to the employee health people about your work-related injuries.  I'm stunned by all of this.  ### BTW-- if you get stuck again-- post-exposure prophylaxis (taking HIV meds after an exposure) will bring your risk to close to 0%.  So, it's always a good idea to tell the hospital what happened so the proper steps can be taken to ensure you dont become infected. ### update: I took the Orasure (oraquick?) test, and it came back negitive!

How long does it survive outside the body in the amount of blood on a suture? A few seconds? Minute? More? ### well with the hernia, it started feeling better, the swelling went down after about 2 weeks, had an ultrasound done, and nothing was found, however it sometimes starts to bother me after standing for a while, and now my other side is starting to bother me, although higher up on my hip.

I started googling symptoms, came up that maybe it was a lymph node that sent me down the HIV anxiety spiral. ### Awesome! I'm so glad. You know, stress can wreak havoc on the body. Maybe the symptoms will go away now.  ### Congratulations! You got over your fear and did the right thing. Now don't you feel better?  ### Symptoms of initial infection (acute infection) are flu-like.  Has it been 3 months since the needle sticks?

Can I ask-- why was the hospital not made aware of the possible exposure? ### Thanks so much for your help! I really appreciate it! ### Its been three months that I can remember, and I haven't had any flu like symptoms.

my throat feels like I have a lump in it right now, and I don't know if its something or if its just my anxiety.  

what do lymph nodes feel like on your neck? are they easy to palpate? ### the hospital wasn't made aware because everyone simply brushed it off and made it into not a big deal, so I just followed suit. ### I'm very glad I did help.  Take care! ### yes-- you can feel them on the throat below the angle of the jaw... but they get swollen from many many things-- including the common cold.  The reason I asked about the months-- it takes 3 months for the body to create antibodies to HIV... so if it's before 3 months, a test could come back negative even if you're positive (false negative).  But since it's been 3 months-- you should get a test.  Then you'll be able to stop worrying.

I wish you could tell me where you work-- I am a public health professional in the field of HIV and I would love to report this place... I'm sorry this happened to you-- no one should ""brush off"" a needle-stick exposure in a hospital.   ### Just a few more questions...

Should I test again or go get a blood test seeing as though I've only had this going on for a little over a month now? ### I'm sorry too. Im just terrified to go take a test. 

If I did they could just say, ""well it was his decision"". 

I dont feel anything noticable under my jaw, except for muscle I suppose.  maybe my neck just bothers me from poking at it and my anxiety...

Another negative test in a couple months will make you feel better.  ### Since it's been more than 3 weeks since the last needle stick the ""window period"" (the time it takes from exposure to have detectable antibodies) has come and gone.  You *could* take a confirmatory test, but since its been 3 weeks since exposure a false negative is unlikely.  As far as a blood test-- you could call a clinic and see what they suggest.  But I bet they would tell you the same thing. ### No-- it's not your decision.   Its completely their fault.  They are guilty of negligence.  They HAVE to follow procedure regardless of what you want to do.  ### I thought it takes 3 months it becomes detectable? ### also-- IF you were indeed exposed and are now infected... your glands would have been swollen months ago (in the first week of exposure) not now.  ### Thanks for letting me know that. I still am terrified of taking something as simple of an orasure test or whatever and having a positive result.

My girlfriend is trying to be supportive, but says she can't take much more of me acting like this. ### Gosh... You're right. I meant 3 months. Oy.. I had a busy day!  ### I just remember my inguinal area being sore/swollen. Girlfriend made me go to Urgent care which said it was an inguinal hernia, I asked about a lymph node, and she said she doubted it.

Went to my GP and same thing, except he called it a muscle strain, and doubted it was a lymph node as well. ### I understand that taking the test is scary.  But it's way less scary than 
a) never knowing and being sick with stress
b) infecting your girlfriend
c) the earlier someone starts treatment the better their health.  

I have friends who are positive.  When you look at their blood under a microscope there is no virus.  Its what's called ""undetectable"".  They have virtually ZERO risk of infecting their partners-- without protection, and they have the exact same expected lifespan as someone who does NOT have HIV...  but this is because they caught the disease early and started treatment early.

waiting will only fuck all of that up.

I just took at test last week-- you can do this.  Just get it done.

Last Sunday I went to an adult massage/prostitute. She was young and stunningly beautiful and appeared perfectly healthy.
I opted for adult massage and handjob. She used baby oil and gave me a quick had job, and then second time, she brought a latex glove and penetrated my anus by an inch or so while she was giving me hand job.
There was no french kiss, not even a covered blow job. Just a naked hand job and anus fingering with glove.
What I don't know is that whether she has any open cuts or lesions on hands.
What are the chances here to contract HIV.
Also my country offers free HIV test which I can take as soon as Monday. But I have been reading that most test will take around 2 weeks to 25 days to become positive (god forbidden). So should I take the test now or wait for a few days?

1mt9ip,"Thought I had HIV and also infected my wife. I just wanted to share my story. I'm 30 years old, straight and recently got married in June 2013. 

2 weeks before I had my wedding I wanted to cross off a fantasy I had for years. I met with a bi sexual married escort couple that provided 3some services to bi and straight guys. They even provided bareback (unprotected) service. I decided to do this high and drunk and made a stupid decision and agreed to have an unprotected straight 3some with them. We engaged in all sorts of penetration and oral acts you can think of: DP, DVP, anal sex, giving/receiving oral. At some point during our session the guy even asked if I wanted to do DAP (double anal penetration). I nicely decline because I knew there was a high risk of exchanging blood with that act. After it was over, I honestly have to say it was the most erotic thing I have ever done.

Fast forward to 1 week after my wedding, I found sores or pimple like symptoms growing on my tonsils. I freaked out and went to the doctor. The doctor diagnosed me with strep throat and prescribed me some antibiotics. The strep went away and came back after a week, I went back to my doctor and he prescribed me with some stronger antibiotics. The strep throat went away and I never felt anything weird or suspected of being infected with anything.

Fast forward again to today 9-20-13. My wife calls me and said she had to leave work due to a really bad fever, body aches, headaches.. etc. She went to the doctor and the doctor said she had a 101 degree fever and has some sort of infection because the back of her throat was bright red. The doctor gave her antibiotics and sent her home. I then started to think.. maybe I got infected with HIV from that escort couple and gave it to my wife??!!. I started to freak the F out at work because about 5 days ago my wife and I had sex while she was on her period, I thought maybe I passed something through her blood. So I decided to pick up the OraQuick HIV test, locked myself in my office and took the test. I waited for the longest 20mins of my life. When I check the test results, it came out negative. I have never been so relieved in my life.

I just wanted to share my story with y'all here because this is something I can't tell anyone I personally know and I just really need to let it out. Its my dark secret and I am planning to take it to the grave with me.

1loau9,"Questions about the latent period. So, if you have unprotected sex, does this mean that you can't rest easy for the rest of your life? I've read that the latent period could last up to 10 years. If you get tested during the latent period, does that mean you will test negative despite the fact of being infected?",3,2013-09-03 18:40:42-04:00,"No. There is a ""window period"" of about 3 months during which you could test negative despite being infected. This is because the tests detect antibodies to HIV which take a few months to develop (though there are tests that detect the actual virus but they are expensive and uncommon). If you get a negative tests 3 months after unprotected sex you are not infected.  ### The '10 year thing' you read was probably referring to the fact that some people show no signs or symptoms of HIV for up to ten years after infection.  ### Don't confuse ""clinical latency"" with the ""window period"". The window period is the first 2-3 weeks that it takes for your immune system to start developing antibodies to the virus. Most initial HIV tests depend on the presence of antibodies, so you can get a false-negative test result if you test too soon after exposure. You need to give your immune system enough time to react to the virus before you can be tested reliably. 

After the initial infection, your immune system gets the virus under control and suppresses it for a period of time (up to 10 years) during which you may not have any signs or symptoms of infection. This is clinical latency. Your body will be producing antibodies to HIV during this time, so an HIV test would be positive, even if you don't have any symptoms.

I been living with HIV for 13 years now. This is one of my 1st post about my life I live with HIV.

In 2000 I met a girl that ended up being a needle user, I try to stop her from the drugs but in the end she pick the drugs over me. In 2001 I met another woman, very much better in not being a junkie. She end up leaving me when I found out I had HIV... 13 years later, no AIDS or sickness, no nothing in my health. My Tcells count is 430 and my Vload is 1400 as of right now. I never been on any HIV/AIDS meds ever. 

I lost friends, lovers and even my self to this HIV! I just want others to know that HIV wont kill you if you give people hugs!!! The most thing I miss in this world is getting random hugs from people.  ",2,2013-08-17 21:52:48-04:00,"Awwh *hugs* don't worry, people just need to be educated!

The WHO guidelines for meds recently changed and with a cd4 under 500, you would be a candidate for anti-retroviral therapy. While your VL is not especially high, it is high enough for transmission.  If you could get your VL to an undetectable level, your partners chance of getting HIV would be reduced by 96%.  I have had sexual relationships with many HIV positive guys, but I would definitely expect a long-term partner to do everything he could to protect me, including having an undetectable VL. ### ",6,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIV/comments/1kkzzn/hiv_in_me_and_the_fear_it_causes_others/

I think the best next step is to find supportive people to talk to. 

The OBGYN being cold is incredibly offensive. There are messed up people in the medical world sometimes and I'm sorry you ran into one of them. That's them being incredibly unprofessional and inhumane. 

If you PM me the city you are in I can give you a number or two of supportive groups in your area. Keep hope, get as much information and support as you can. You can get through this. 

 ### In may of last year my best friend (we seriously might as well be partners) tested positive for HIV. He went through some intense denial issues. Mainly when he tested positive they told him that judging by his viral load he had been positive or 5 - 10 years, but likely more. His father died of AIDS related illnesses. Because he was just in denial about the whole thing he pretty much decided he wasn't going to seek treatment and go through ARVs until he graduated college. As of last month he is now living with AIDS. He can no longer walk well and is slowly wasting away in our bedroom. I'm telling you this not to get you down but to let you know that you need to start treatment as soon as possible. Starting ARVs now will allow you to live a healthy life. HIV doesn't mean the end any more. With drugs like complera and Atripla you can take one pill a day and live a normal healthy life. Get help as soon as possible. Also seek psychological help. What you are going through is a ridiculous amount of things to handle. Getting help is nothing to be ashamed of. Denial is common among newly diagnosed HIV patients. It will only make your situation worse though. I don't even know you, but I love you. There are thousands of people like you and there are thousands of people that are willing to support you. Let those people be there for you. If you want to know anything more about social services that are their to provide medication and support just PM. At this point I'm pretty familiar with the system.   ### I'm so sorry this happened to you. You need to talk to someone as soon as possible about this. You're going through a really tough time, and you shouldn't do it alone. You'll need all of the support you can get. If you're in the US, there should be support groups and clinics in your area.

1icstf,"""magnetic"" couples (+/-) ? Hello, I am a Straight female (30's) my partner is a straight male (30's). He is (+) I am (-).  He was first diagnosed about 7 years ago, is currently on medication, and he has consistently tested as ""undetectable"" for the last 5 years or so (when he started his current treatment of Truvada and Isentriss). To me, all of this seems to be great news. But he seems to have this constant attitude of ""poor me, why me"". This really frustrates me. He told me he was (+) before we started dating.  And I have treated him the same way as I always have (we've known each other for over 20 yrs). I feel like with HIV not being a terminal condition like it used to be, there's no need for ""special treatment"". I feel like I should treat him the same as I would anybody with a chronic condition that is being managed with medication. And that means treating him the same as I do everyone else in the world. It's like he acts as though HIV is who he is. Not a virus that he has, that is actually being treated very well with his medication.  Is it wrong of me to be annoyed, and turned off when he acts this way?  Am I being too insensitive? Or is he being too sensitive? Have any other couples come across this? How do you handle it? ",4,2013-07-15 14:26:09-04:00,"Generally, treating him like everyone else is the right choice, I think.

But ultimately, he *is* HIV+.  He's got a longterm, contagious, chronic illness.  He will always face the worry of developing resistance or infecting you, and will be dealing with drugs and regular doctor visits perhaps for the rest of his life.

He might hide how much of a toll that has on him.

Depression is very common in HIV+ patients and as has been said, for many HIV+ people, the worst part of the disease is the toll on psychological health, not physical.

I can't tell you if you're being too hard on him, but I think you should try to understand how he sees it.  Not how you, or he, *thinks* he *should* see it, but how he *actually* feels about it, day to day.  Try to understand why he feels and thinks that way, and if the reasons are irrational, help him challenge his ways of thinking and his beliefs.  If he's outright depressed, he might need help for that too.

(also, FYI this subreddit is pretty inactive and there's more activity going on over in /r/hivaids ) ### ""Magnetic"" might be slang, but the term you're looking for is ""Serodiscordant"" relationship. 
I used to be in a serodiscordant relationship too, I was (and still am) negative, and my partner was positive.  I can totally sympathize with you over how hard it is to want to make your partner feel better when they're not.  For me, it sometimes felt like he wasn't appreciative of me being around at all.  Why wasn't he happy that he at least had me? 

The relationship ended for other reasons, though. 

I would just tell my (now ex) boyfriend that I thought he was good enough and that I loved him for who he was, all of him unconditionally.  I mean we still practiced safe sex only, of course, and that was fine.  If he'd say he thought his life was shitty I'd just say ""well I think you're fucking amazing no matter how badly you want to believe otherwise. so suck it."" or something to that affect... ### Yeah, after I posted I saw that the other sub seemed to get more traffic. But I couldn't figure out how to copy/paste from my phone. 
Thanks for the insight. I have suggested maybe going to a support group...even offered to go with him if he wanted. But he doesn't seem to be too into that idea. I want to be supportive but at the same time not baby him. I think I'm having difficulty finding the right balance.  ### Thank you :)

1id07x,"3rd Unequivocal Test I had an unequivocal test in November. The same day I went to another clinic and took an insti-HIV test (the finger prick, 60 second test). This was negative.  
2 weeks later, I went back to the original clinic to be tested again. This was also unequivocal. The doctor said maybe not enough time had past to allow changes to develop. However, they did a viral load on this blood sample, which was negative.  
Today, I had another (3rd) unequivocal result from a test 1 week ago. 

So, I'm confused. Why would I have 3 unequivocal results? Why would the viral load be negative, the insti test be negative but the antigen test be unequivocal 3 times with 8 months between tests?  

edit: I meant equivocal NOT unequivocal.",8,2013-07-15 15:50:37-04:00,"What tests are we talking about here? You're saying you had three positive WBs through 8 months and undetectable VL, and a negative insta test? ### Unequivocally what? I'm a little confused too, but if you send some more details maybe I can help. Has 3 months passed from the time of exposure?  ### The test is an HIV anti-body test. I don't know the specifics, I didn't ask. I should've though. The viral load was negative, the 3 antibody test were equivocal (uncertain), and the insti-hiv test was negative. ### Sorry for the confusion and my bad wording. What I meant was equivocal, not unequivocal. The tests were carried out at a walk-in clinic offered by the NHS in the UK.  
They take a blood sample and check for HIV antibodies. I don't know if it's a Western Blot or something else. I didn't ask. The result can be positive, negative or equivocal. Equivocal basically means uncertain - the lab was unable to determine either way if antibodies were present. 

On the same day as the first equivocal test I went to a different clinic and paid for an insti-hiv test and this was negative.  

I then wwent back to the NHS walk-in clinic about 2 weeks later and had another test with them. This also came back equivocal.  

And the 3rd one was earlier this month.  

I've been in a 6 year relationship, which has been exclusive. We're not together anymore as bg/gf. I didn't expect to be positive based on our histories but we had unprotected sex throughout those 6 years.  

I will go and pay for another test I think. Probably HIV duo test or insti-test again just for piece of mind.

 ### Ok, you said uncertain now, which is exactly the opposite of unequivocal. However if you take an uncertain antibody test like elisa, if it comes out positive, the standard protocol is to make a certain one like western blot. They should've done it on you already (3 times!). The only possibility as far as I know, if all of this is correct, is that you have been exposed to HIV and developed antibodies, but didn't get infected. You should consult an infectologist.

Edit: just read your other comments. Keep researching, it seems you didn't get a positive test. Talk with a specialized doctor. ### What I would do is wait 3 months from your last unprotected sex act (takes 3 months for antibodies to form and be detected).  If it's negative at that point, I think its ok to take the one negative you got, plus the next as confirmation.  If it comes back positive, then you would get a confirmatory test at that time.  ### Thanks for your reply. Sorry for my confusion with the terminology.  

As it stands today, I've had 3 equivocal antigen tests, 1 negative viral load and 1 negative insti-hiv test. So confusing!! 

I will follow it up with another clinic tomorrow.  

edit: if the insti-test is correct, does that trump the other tests? I mean, if I tested negative on the insti-hiv test, does that mean I'm negative, regardless of the equivocal antigen tests?
 ### What confuses me are the 3 equivocal tests. As I understand, they didn't give you a positive or negative result, they just said it was inconclusive, which I've never heard of. Elisa test (the more common, afaik) gives either a positive or negative result, and tests for antibodies. In the case of a positive result, it's not conclusive, that is, it may be a false positive. When you get a positive result, they immediately do a Western Blot test, which I understand is unequivocal.

The viral load detects virus above a certain count, which I don't remember. HIV positive people under treatment for some time get an undetectable viral load. This is, by the way, viral load on blood. The virus hangs around in reservoirs too.

The negative insti-test is a good sign to hang on to for the moment. Take an elisa test as soon as you can and go from there.  ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIV/comments/1id07x/3rd_unequivocal_test/
1i8g9x,"Hiv+ ? Don't go to Canada. Check it out. Let me start by saying i am a 50 year hold hiv+ gay male. I recently tried to go to Toronto to meet another hiv+ gay male in the hopes of starting a relationship. We had chatted on-line and seemed to hit it off.
Upon arriving at Pierson, I was questioned by Customs at the airport. I told them I was here on vacation and where my hotel reservation was. They asked who I knew in Toronto and I said, "" No one"" which I thought was the best answer because I didn't think my on-line buddy qualified as a friend yet.
I was directed to go to a secondary inspection station. I noticed that many men traveling alone were also being interrogated.
This cunt of a Sarah Palin look-alike went through my bags, asked for passwords to my phone and lap-top, social security number and continued to question me about my criminal background.
I did not mention an arrest 14 YEARS AGO, of which the charges were dismissed for lack of evidence. She accused me of lying and said that she could send me back to the states for either my lying or the underlying criminality- in other words, there was no right answer. They kept me seated in Customs for 2 hours while they stared at my laptop. When the other travelers were all gone and they brought out evidence bags, I knew I was going to be arrested.
They cuffed me and said that I was being arrested for smuggling material ""Offensive to the Crown"" and took me to a cell where I was strip searched.
I asked for a lawyer. When the agent began speaking to the lawyer, he said I was being arrested for ""Attempting to smuggle child Porn""!
Now let me explain- there were some salty pictures on that computer. I don't remember what they were, because I have had a new computer for a couple years, but there was nothing of people that could be considered under age. Hell!, I don't even like to be around children!
So I spoke to the lawyer on the phone and she gave me the standard advice, but I could sense the loathing in her voice.
Next part is surreal. I had been in custody for hours. It was time to take my HIV pill. The Customs agent said he couldn't let me just take a pill. He called for a Paramedic. The Paramedic arrived and said that he couldn't give me the pill either. I was transported in an ambulance to a nearby hospital! While on the gurney, a dead body was pushed by next to me. Children with broken bones were screaming everywhere. Citizens fed up with the shitty Canadian health care system were screaming at the staff. I sat and contemplated my future. Charged with trying to smuggle child port was the final insult to my dignity. First I became an older gay man, which is devastating in itself. Second, I acquired HIV in my 50th year, which was also devastating, causing my two close sexual companions, who I had known for almost a decade, to abandon me. The HIV drug was also making my life miserable with the side effects. So being charged with this awful crime was all that I could bear. I decided then and there that I was going to make bail, go to my hotel and jump from the balcony. I took comfort in this thought, given my current circumstances.
I waited in a small room surrounded by pandemonium and two oafish Customs agents for two hours before a nurse (my hero) came in and said the following, ""So he has to take his meds and instead of handing him the pill, you admitted him to the hospital? Are you kidding me?!!! She then left because only a doctor could give me the pill and discharge me. The doctor came in and asked what I was being arrested for. I said, ""I have no idea. I am a businessman from California on vacation and the next thing I know I am being arrested for smuggling something they think is offensive"". ( Why was this question appropriate for a doctor to ask? Did this have something to do with my health?) The doctor gave me my pill and back to the airport we went. Oh, by the way, I had to pay $700 for the ambulance and the ""Treatment""
I asked the agent if the bail system on Canada was similar to the states. He said at that point, "" I don't think it will come to that, they will probably send you home"".
Well thanks for telling me that 6 hours into this ordeal! Fucking asshole! I had just decided to end my life! He then added, "" There were definitely pictures of underage males engaged in sex acts on my computer. I explained I have no interest in that. He said, "" Well that's good to hear"". (Keep in mind, they did not show me their ""evidence"" so I have no idea what the pictures were. And how did they know the subjects in the pics were not of age? I like Asian guys, and they look boyish into their 30's!)
Back at the airport I went from Customs to Immigration. The Immigration agent summarized my situation. I was not getting into Canada. My passport had been flagged and I could pretty much expect the same treatment should I try to enter Canada again. Then she said the strangest thing of all. She said that when I told the first customs agent that I was traveling on vacation and that I didn't have names and addresses of friends in Toronto, my fate was sealed. She said that I couldn't just come to Toronto to ""hang out"" in the village. I said, "" Yes I can"" I have done it before, and I often go to cities just to hang out. She countered: ""No you can't"". I was blown away.
I was asked to sign a voluntary exit statement. I had reservations. Isn't this what third world dictatorships do? Isn't this like signing a guilty plea under duress? I was told that I be on the first flight out in the morning, due to my desire to involve the US consulate in my detainment (good advice for any traveler). I think this may have helped in the long run. Next I was told that I would be held in a detainment center till the morning. I was cuffed and perp walked out of the airport.
The detainment center was basically a jail. The guards and drivers were civilians. This was a corporate jail. The employees of the detention center were very civil and polite. They treated me well and I will always be thankful for that. The facility, however, was a converted motel and the beds were scary. I thought I would get lice by laying on it. I lay there in the dark for 3 hours without catching a wink of sleep. My bunk mates were Sikh Muslims that were obviously having their own problems with the authorities. One was crying in his sleep. I was able to observe the detainment center employees while I was waiting for the ride back to the airport. They were all either Black, Middle eastern or Hispanic. Their main chore in their jobs was keeping from falling asleep. This was all they talked about. One employee said he wanted to paint eyeballs on his eyelids so the looked awake at all times! When they dropped me off at the airport, I thanked them for their kindness and told them that I was not guilty of what I was being accused of. They said that did not matter to them. I explained I had some dirty pictures on my laptop, that was my crime. They then smiled and said, "" Oh my God! They do that to travelers all the time!""
An extremely cute Immigration agent told me that he would try to get me on the 8:20 flight back the US. I waited then he told me that flight was full and I would have to wait for the 11:30 flight. So I sat for hours. They then perp walked me to the ticket counter, through security and to the gate. They even walked me on to the plane. Dignity is non-existent at this point. The final insult is that the plane sat on the ground for an hour due to mechanical problems.
So now I am back home. I have a record of a hideous arrest on my record. If it could happen to me, it could happen to anyone.
Here is the takeaway: Since 9-11, we have over-funded all these agencies that have to justify their existence. Most of the facilities that I saw were largely empty and over-staffed. If they don't produce arrests, how can they say they are relevant and deserve funding? I can only imagine what my arrest cost Canada in the way of labor hours. And for what?
And since when did they get the authority to look at the electronic devices without probable cause or a warrant? I know they do this in the US and it is just fucking wrong. It is unconstitutional.
You may disagree with me, but please keep my sexual orientation out of it. This is about the government being out of control and discouraging citizens from traveling at will. It is also about profiling and discrimination.",0,2013-07-13 16:03:45-04:00,,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIV/comments/1i8g9x/hiv_dont_go_to_canada_check_it_out/

Tldr: you're likely all good, never hurts to get the test.  ### from http://www.significancemagazine.org/details/webexclusive/2125431/The-OraQuick-Test-and-HIV-Screening.html

Researchers found that that 92% of people who are HIV positive received a positive test result. This is called the ""sensitivity"" of the test. They also found that 99.98% of people who were HIV negative received a negative test result. This is called the ""specificity"" of the test.

In terms of numbers, this means that about 2 in every 25 people who have HIV will receive a false negative test, and 2 in every 10,000 people without HIV will receive a false positive result.

So-- since you are clearly out of the 'window period' this false reading would not be false due to lack of antibodies, but *could* be due to the general rate of false negatives.  You might as well get another test-- just to be sure-- ease your mind.  =)  ### False negatives are rare, but get another test to ease your mind.

1hp0mt,"I'm the neg partner in a serodiscordant relationship and my SO seems to be slowly dying Hi. I'm fucking scared.

My SO[36M] learned he had HIV while with me. He doesn't know how long he's had it or how he got it - I have my own suspicions, but overall, that doesn't concern me. 

He got on medication in October of last year. He's about 90% with his meds, missing about a day a month, I think. 

He also works as a teacher, easily hitting over 60 hours a week. His job is stressful because the people he works for are not very organized for running a school. 

It is these two things that have had me growing increasingly concerned, and lately, terrified for his health. When we first met/got together, he was just kind of old - joint aches were his main issue, and it wasn't so bad. But after almost a year on the medication, he's become much worse - generally, there is a lot more blood exiting from his body than before (from vomiting and sinuses), he says he is developing ulcers, and he is extremely tired all the time. He rarely sees a day off to rest from his ridiculous hours. And, to be honest, he doesn't really take all that great care of himself either - he regularly smokes and drinks, though he drinks significantly less than he used to.

I'm coming here because I'm scared he's dying - he seems to be getting worse every day that I see him. He's proud - so he tries to hide what it is that he's going to, and I still have trouble helping him bear that burden. So I can't directly help him...I also don't really have anyone to talk to - I don't want to go around telling people, ""Hey, my SO is HIV positive!"", because for the most part, they also know him.

And...we don't really have the money to go to a doctor. -I- have health insurance, but it doesn't extend to him...

If any of you have seen your partner go from strong to weak while on HIV meds, how did you handle it? What did you do? I'm scared I'm going to lose him.

tl;dr: My SO is old, overstressed, and on HIV meds. His condition has gone from okay to bad in the past year. I'm scared that he's dying and I don't know what to do. Help.",0,2013-07-05 11:29:45-04:00,,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIV/comments/1hp0mt/im_the_neg_partner_in_a_serodiscordant/

1dmii7,"I know you guys probably get posts like this all the time... I just had sex with a transgender escort.

Well I say sex, it was just oral both ways, but I did let her cum in my mouth and I swallowed some of it, there wasn't a huge amount.

I've been looking up statistics for the HIV risk with oral. Obviously I have no idea if she was clean or not (I know I know, bareback oral was stupid), but I can't get any clarity on the risks. Some sites seem to think there is potentially no risk of HIV from oral, or maybe some small risk.

For example, the CDC site [CDC](http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/law/transmission.htm) lists various estimates if risks but I don't quite follow what they are saying.

For example, they say receptive anal intercourse is a risk of 50 out of 10,000 exposures. So, do they mean all exposures are unprotected with a HIV+ person, so if you do that 10000 times you expect to catch the infection 50. Or is it out of 10000 times using protection. Or is it just out of 10000 whether the partner is + or -, out of 10000 you'd expect to catch it 50 times statistically? It doesn't really mention if its with protection or not.

LIke I said, it was oral only, and after 3 months I'll pop along to a GUM clinic here (UK sexual health clinics) as I assume thats how long I have to wait. There are also home tests I can order but I think they need to wait 3 months too.",2,2013-05-03 12:01:07-04:00,"Has this been filtered out, I can't see it in the ""new"" or /r/hiv page... ### Well, think this was filtered out and I'm just talking to myself. But here's a crazy quick update.

I went along to Warwick A&E to chat to someone about PEP and risks etc. They run a GUM clinic during the week (UK Sexual Health clinics) and normally i'd just go to that, but its not open again until Mon, and mornings are appointment only yadda yadda.

Anyway, chatted to the people there. They rang up some experts but basically said, it was so low risk, they didn't recommend or feel the need to do anything. They even said its only worth going in for a test for peace of mind if I wanted to (I asked them about this, otherwise they wouldn't have suggested it.

Either way I now feel a bit of a tit. I wasted their time (thankfully it wasn't, or didn't appear, busy), and the girl I spent time with earlier was lovely and feel a bit of an arsehole just thinking she must be some disease ridden whore.

So, I'm just going to pop along to the GUM clinic on Mon as its a day off anyway, and its worth just getting a checkup anyway as I haven't had one before (but i'm not very sexually active, in terms of penatrative sex, I've had it...maybe...3 times this year, and I've never ever not used a condom).

Overall, the one thing I have learnt, is how great Warwick NHS hospital is, drove there, saw a nurse, then a doctor, then drove back all in around 1 hr. ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIV/comments/1dmii7/i_know_you_guys_probably_get_posts_like_this_all/

There it is, right in your daily paper, on your tablet or computer screen, or wherever you get your news today — a headline about a great medical breakthrough everyone’s been waiting for:

Scientists on brink of HIV cure
Researchers believe that there will be a breakthrough in finding a cure for HIV “within months”
Yes, I read this exact headline recently. Here’s the full article, published in the English newspaper the Daily Telegraph. It details how some Danish researchers have figured out a way for “the HIV virus to be stripped from human DNA and destroyed permanently by the immune system.”

Furthermore, they are “expecting results that will show that finding a mass-distributable and affordable cure to HIV is possible.”

By all means, go ahead and read the full piece; you’ve got 20 free reads on the Telegraph website. As a treat, there’s a colorful stock photo too, showing red blood cells floating through some blood vessels, along with a few HIV virions glowing bright green — it’s very Fantastic Voyage-esque, minus Raquel Welch in her scuba gear.

But return here for a moment, please. I’m going to recommend three simple steps to getting the most from this — and other medical breakthroughs — in the mainstream media.

Step 1:  Be a skeptic.  As exciting as curing HIV would be, and no matter how much you’d like this to happen, just think for a moment about the plausibility of this story. Are scientists really on the “brink” of curing HIV? If so, why is this only appearing in the U.K. Telegraph? Trust me, this brink-of-cure has not yet appeared in peer-reviewed medical journals or at scientific meetings. And wouldn’t you expect this kind of advance, if real, to show up everywhere in media land?  Fire up that Google machine, and see what you can find about it elsewhere — lo, it’s the great following herd, all stampeding after that same U.K. Telegraph story. And importantly, here’s a New York Times piece on the very same general subject — HIV cure — and they don’t even mention these Danish researchers. Sure, the Times misses some stories, but it’s got some pretty impressive Health and Science sections — could they miss this, researchers ON THE BRINK OF CURING HIV, no less? I think not. So perhaps Mr. U.K. Telegraph Science Reporter is exaggerating a bit, for the sake of his story, of course.

Step 2:  Don’t be a complete snob — give the story a chance.  This is the other side of that same coin. Sure, it’s been a challenge curing HIV, but we’ve got that Berlin patient (now living in Las Vegas, by the way) — he’s cured. And the baby from Mississippi, he/she is cured (sort of). Plus, a whole army of smart HIV researchers actively tackling the problem as we speak. In fact, this very same approach cited by the Danish researchers — stimulating the HIV reservoir with an HDAC inhibitor — is a leading candidate for a viable cure strategy; it’s being looked at by many groups. Hey, why can’t Good Ol’ Ole Søgaard and his team be the first to succeed? The extra funding provided by the Danish government — 12 million Danish kroner! — is further evidence of the soundness of Professor Søgaard’s approach.

Step 3:  After all that, land someplace between Steps 1 and 2.  Take a deep breath. Read the full piece.
Discard the fluff: Brink of cure; 12 million Danish kroner; expect a cure to be available in months; you can distribute it to millions; it’s affordable, too.
Focus on the facts:  Some Danish researchers have some funding to investigate a potentially promising HIV cure strategy; they are testing it in a small number of people; some European scientists may soon be collaborating; we have no actual results yet to report.

After these three steps, all these medical breakthroughs — on HIV, cancer, Alzheimer’s, weight loss, male-pattern baldness, you-name-it — make a lot more sense. ### 03-05-2013
Correction to HIV story

""During the past week a story originating in the Telegraph entitled ""Scientists on brink of HIV cure"" has been published in other medias.

The article's title and subtitle suggests that a cure for HIV is expected in months. But this is not the case, according to the Danish researchers from Aarhus University Hospital whose work was cited in the Telegraph.

- We are not on the brink of an HIV cure, says Dr. Ole Søgaard from Aarhus University Hospital.
- We have an exciting study in which a potential anti-HIV latency reversing agent is tested in persons with HIV. We are making good progress, but there is still a long way to go.""

The authors state that they regret if anyone got the impression from reading the article that there may be a cure for HIV in the immediate future. Like many others, the researchers believe that a cure for HIV is an achievable goal, but most likely it will take many years, numerous basic science discoveries, and several phase 1/2 trials before a HIV cure may actually be reached.

2. Make sure the condom is pushed to the opposite you are opening it

3. Open condom wrapper but remember the condom can be torn by sharp objects. Only put on condom after there is a partial or full erection.

4.  Make sure there is no air trapped inside a condom because that may cause it to break. Squeeze the tip of the condom with your fingertips to leave some extra space in the tip, and put on condom, rolling the entire condom down to the base of the penis, still pinching the top. Be sure that the roll is on the outside.

5. Make sure the condom stays in place during sex; if it rolls up, roll it back into place immediately. If the condom comes off, withdraw the penis and put on a new condom.

6. After ejaculation has occurred, while fully erect pull out while holding the condom.  Put the condom in a tissue and place it in the trash.

1ctc3p,"Losing my mind Mar 10 at 1 am, I had a risky encounter with a woman that is known to be a bit promiscuous.  Though her status is unknown, my mind has convinced me of the worst (that she is +).  It was unprotected and I penetrated her for about 10-20 min.  Apr 13 I developed a dry cough and headache.  April 14 I had a fever of 100.7°F and on April 15, 102.5°F, and then slowly dropping to normal Apr 16 and 17.

 ### I couldn't wait any further.  I went and got the home test.  It came out negative.  I still keep wondering, what if I did it wrong, what if it's a false negative, what if this, what if that...  I'll definitely get a blood test done at the 3 mo. mark and then also at the 6 mo. mark.  I've been abstaining from sex since my possible exposure.  I could never willingly expose anyone else to the amount of stress that I've felt.  I'm not as nervous any more but I'm still very anxious to have conclusive results.  This has been a huge life lesson for me thus far and I hope that I get desirable results on future tests.  Thanks for your response and the information. ### Take a deep breath, and remember that even if the worst happens, you will be ok. I have been HIV+ for over a year. Just remember to take your meds, find a doctor you like, eat healthy and get regular exercise, and you'll be healthier than 95% of people out there. ### Hi there,

I have a masters in public health and I work for a non-profit that trains clinicians in HIV.  Any test that tests for antibodies of HIV will give a false negative because you can have an acute (immediate) infection and not have detectable antibodies-- this is why it takes 3 months. You need to see an MD ASAP though, because if you really think you've been exposed to HIV they can put you on HIV medications in order to prevent the virus from infecting you.  Go to the ER and tell them you think you were exposed and that you need PEP (post exposure prophylaxis).  Your symptoms could be the flu-- or a cold-- or acute HIV.  Chances of getting HIV from an infected female are very slim per act of unprotected sex (something like less than 1/1000). So dont freak out-- but go get seen-- if you have been exposed and get on meds fast you CAN prevent being infected.  ### The probability that you'd get it from one encounter is horrifyingly low. Most will test positive after 1 month, but it's necessary to wait 3 mos. ### ",8,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIV/comments/1ctc3p/losing_my_mind/

Or if she had been tested for other STDs? And are you showing any symptoms? And how long ago did you sleep with her?

1a4amz,"Partner not sure if born with AIDS or not I know this sounds ridiculous, and it still is to me when I hear it, but I just learned that my boyfriend, whom I've always thought was born with HIV, may not actually be so. The doctor he'd seen all his life was and is sure of it, but everywhere else he goes says ""No, you don't have it."" Obviously, this would be amazing news to me to find out he doesn't, but he's been so used to it over his life that his mindset is ""better safe than sorry"". While I understand that, I'm worried about the effects of taking the medication all his life, which he has, if the truth of the matter is that he's never had it. Would any of you all know if it's a danger to him, and also who he could go to to get an *absolute*, no questions asked answer?

What is the basis for them saying he doesn't have it? Undetectable viral load?

 ### The blood tests for HIV are incredibly accurate. Thinking one has HIV when one doesn't must be a terrible way to live. 

Have him go get one, or even two if that will set his mind at ease. Most HIV tests are actually two tests. One that is more sensitive, meaning if HIV is there the test is very good at detecting it. And one that is more specific, in that if HIV isn't there, it will report no HIV. Between these two tests, ELIZA and Western Blot, the results are veeerrrrry accurate.   ### Was his mother positive?  This is kind of a confusing question........ antibody tests would be able to indicate whether he has HIV or not.  Viral Load tests coming back negative doesn't mean he isn't infected because people who are on medications (and some elite controllers) can have undetectable viral load tests.  But the go-to test is an antibody test, so if he's getting negative antibody tests, he's not infected.  

He should not take HIV meds if he isn't infected, unless he's taking them as a prophylaxis (post or pre-exposure).   ### If it turns out he doesn't not have HIV, does that mean the two of you would be in a sero-dischordant relationship? Or are you already in one? Also, what if he's another example of what happened to that baby who was ""cured"" of HIV? He could be a unique case. ### He wouldn't be like the baby that was cured  - that was a very unique case, where the baby was treated with HIV medications in a way that had never been done before.....so if he's old enough to be someone's boyfriend, this wouldn't be the case for him. ### ",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIV/comments/1a4amz/partner_not_sure_if_born_with_aids_or_not/

19g0bc,"I'm the neg partner in a serodiscordant relationship and am wondering what advice you have to give about risk management. Also, I have heard that there are medications one can take to decrease the chances of seroconversion following exposure. Anyone know about this? If it's true, how would I find the right doctor to talk to?

Edit: Forgot to mention that we are both men.",11,2013-02-28 23:29:05-05:00,"I'm in the same boat. My boyfriend found out he was positive right as we were getting together, so we went to his doctor to ask for advice. There are three things you should do:

1- Get his viral load at undetectable if it's not already there. He and his doctor need to figure out which meds he needs, and then he needs to adhere to the regimen.  

2- Minimize your exposure to his fluids. I wouldn't use the same razor, toothbrush, or contact lenses. Kissing and oral exposure to his semen aren't likely to transmit HIV unless you have a sore or cut in your mouth. Use condoms for anal. Although his blood viral load may be undetectable, his semen viral load may not be. He may also have small blips in his viral load that may make the virus slightly more transmissible. 

3- Look into prophylactic Truvada. I just began that recently and haven't experienced any side effects (except for vivid dreams, which aren't bad). My doctor told me I can either take this on a daily basis or take it for a couple of days after a suspected exposure. I have elected to take it every day. This is now an FDA-approved use of Truvada, so your health insurance should cover most of the cost of it. I wind up paying only about $60/month after my medication deductible is covered. It's worth it for the peace of mind.  ### http://betablog.org/one-mans-year-on-prep/ ### I'm in the same situation for over a year now. In love w the most amazing man. The only part if the relationship that is a bit of a drag is that he can't bareback me. Besides that, I barely think about it. There were a few drunken oops moments, so to give myself the best chance to not convert I took the same meds hue was on for 30 days. It's hard, but if you play by the rules and don't put yourself at risk, your relationship will be much better and less stressful. The doctor you want to talk to about the Prep treatment is an infectious diseases doc. I found one near me who was very helpful, non judgmental, and I formative. Well, not really non judgmental, when you let someone w HIV stick their dick in you they think you are an idiot, so maybe say that the condom broke, saves a lot of explanation  ### Is your partner on meds? are they undetectable? are they free of other STDs?

If so, your risk of transmission is pretty minimal and you should be safe. I would still stick with condoms just for the extra bit of security, but if it was to slip/break, it wouldn't be the end of the world.

If you guys are getting serious, you should see your doctor, or preferably see his doctor (assuming his doctor specializes in HIV treatment) and discuss what your options are.

If you do become exposed to HIV, you can do PeP treatment, which is basically you take HIV meds within 72 hours of exposure for some time (few weeks), and has a pretty high success rate of preventing transmission.

There is also PreP --- which is much like PeP, but you basically take Truvada (an HIV med), daily - and it can prevent you from becoming positive. To me, it seems kind of silly to 'take an HIV medication every day for the rest of my life (with my partner) to prevent needing to take the same HIV medication every day of my life if I became HIV+' -- if your partner is on meds and undetectable, it's probably not worth it.

See if your city has any hassle free / anonymous testing / sexual health / planned parent hood type places - they might be able to provide you with more information than just your standard walk-in doctor. ### Taking medications is the most effective method of keeping you safe after using condoms.  If he is undetectable, he is less likely to transmit the virus to you.  If you use condoms and he takes medications, and there are no other STD's present, your chances of contracting HIV are very low.  

All in all, anything you can do to reduce your exposure to his semen (or blood if you're into that) will reduce your risk of contracting HIV.  Oral sex is safer than anal sex.  Topping is safer than bottoming (though some people argue this, it's pretty well accepted in the HIV medical world).  Having him pull out before he cums if you're not using condoms, etc.  Reduce the amount (both volume and frequency) of exposure to blood & semen and you reduce your chance of contracting it. 

Good luck and good on you for not running when he told you his status! ### Cool, thank you for the advice. He already takes truvada, so it seems if I were to see his doctor i'd be likely to get a prescription. ### Thanks. Does your partner have trouble with being embarassed or feeling ""dirty"" for putting you at risk? We have largely overcome that through my insistence that he is the most beautiful boy in the whole world, but still there are times when it seems like he feels.... idk... inferior to me because of the hiv. ### HIV patients rarely take only Truvada -- most regimens are Truvada plus some other drug, such as Isentress, Norvir, Reyataz, Sustiva, Elvitegravir, and/or others. Truvada itself is known to have relatively minor side effects, but other drugs that are in HIV regimens are harder on the body -- i.e. cause more severe side effects or can have a deleterious effect on the kidneys or liver. It would be worth taking Truvada (a drug with easily tolerable side effects) to avoid becoming HIV+ so as to avoid dealing with the side effects of taking more drugs.  ### Yes, yes, and yes. Thanks for the advice - I didn't even think about going to see his doctor. He takes truvada already, so it sounds like that would be a good option for us. ### Thanks. It was tough, because he only told me about it AFTER we had hooked up bareback as friends... but I insisted that bygones are bygones and that I knew he was scared and guilty. Plus, I knew that dealing with it was worth it, because he's seriously a great man. ### He doesn't feel inferior, but I think we probably don't have sex as much as I would like to because he doesn't want to put me at risk. Honestly, it's not a big deal, it's just one more thing to manage in the relationship.  ### ",7,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIV/comments/19g0bc/im_the_neg_partner_in_a_serodiscordant/

I asked, and received a ""What do you think?"" as a response.  So I tried looking online, and found nothing reliable.  Best I could get was either 24 hours from a fever or 48 hours from a fever with no explanation. Figured that there might be an expert here who might be able to provide a more concrete answer.

I wound up leaving work, because I didn't want to take the chance. ### bad answer.  OP could have PCP [jfgi] , and this could be threatening.  Don't answer posts wrt medicine that you are not authoritative to.  For everyone's health. ### Not worried about a cold. Worried about flu or pneumocystis pneumonia. If they are fighting off my cold, and are exposed to the flu, and they have a low tcell count, it could be disastrous. 

Many of my clients have AIDS. Low tcells and high viral loads. 

Don't tell me that catching a cold won't hurt them. 

And whoever downvoted my question is a jackass.  ### I am a little surprised that your agency has no set guidelines, but alas it may not be the only one. I did some looking and it seems that a cold is most contagious 2-4 days after becoming infected, apparently the same time as you are most symptomatic.   I looked at medline ( an NIH site) and webmd, I saw a couple random sites that had mostly the same info. luckily its the weekend so you may not miss much work.  ###   PCP is something you obviously need to refer to have labs and respiratory get involved with.
 
  However, if you think that ""low t-cell"" and ""high viral"" are indices of anything 
 
  (cluephone is ringing: it's about the percentage, NOT the absolutes), 
  then you should be referring your pts to an HIV specialist/clinic.  
 
  If you are a FM/GP/IM type, then for your own pts' sake -- refer them out to experts in the field.
 
  HIV is a son of a bitch : Not directly; Atrip/Quad can quash high virals in < 90 days.. 
However, there are Oh So Many ways in which that motherfucker likes to present itself --- you can
see abs VL > 500K drop to < 50 and think everything is hunkey-dorey, but what are the cd4/8, and
is the pt showng improvement there?  What about Neuts, Plates?
 
  Is there a derivation from baseline on a metabolic panel (do you even have one?)
 
  Trends, blips, it's why there are tens of thousands of people around this blue marble trying to 
figure out how to slice this fucker's throat.
 
  Don't get yourself overwhelmed in it -- it's a rabbit hole (arguably one that may be both the most frustrating
and at the same time the most fulfilling) that you'll ever have to decide upon:
 
  Are you in, or are you out?  Once you're in, you're never out.
 
 ### I was not worried about myself getting sick. I'm negative. I was worried about transmitting my URI to a client, getting them sick and leaving their immune system exposed to PCP or any other opportunistic infection.  ### You probably won't expose them to PCP if your immunohealth / sero status is good.
 
Universal Precautions, at -any- rate, should be observed and adhered to, without exception.  If their numbers are bad, and esp. if there is a chance of mrsa xmission, you should be extra careful.

18ywmb,"Are you posting here because you think you may have contracted HIV? A large majority of the questions on this subreddit are people wanting to know if they could have contracted HIV in an extremely low-risk sexual encounter.  Let me be clear:  HIV is not easy to catch.  Very rarely does someone contract HIV from one sexual encounter with an HIV positive person (although it can happen).  Bottoming for condom-less anal sex where someone cums in your ass would be a fairly risky sexual act.  Bottoming for condom-less vaginal sex where someone cums in your vagina can also be fairly risky.  Men are much less likely to contract HIV from a woman.  Oral sex is considered low risk.  Any kind of sex with a condom is considered low risk.  Decreasing your exposure to semen or vaginal secretions decreases your risk of contracting HIV.  If you one time performed oral sex on a woman and you think you contracted HIV because you may have had a small canker sore in your mouth, or you topped someone with a condom and later heard he might have HIV, or you gave someone a  blow job and they didn't cum in your mouth, but WHAT IF!!??!!??, then you probably need to do two things more than you need an HIV test: 1) Stop putting yourself in any kind of ""what if"" situation and always use condoms and lube during all sexual encounters; and 2) **Go to a counselor and get treatment for your anxiety.** 

Your anxiety is presenting itself in the package of HIV, but you are probably anxious about a lot of things.  You probably worry about things all the time.  You probably need to get some counseling or start medication to treat your anxiety.  These things can help you deal with your anxiety so you're not constantly worried.


Source: HIV social worker",25,2013-02-21 14:02:08-05:00,"p.s. I'm not trying to be an asshole.... but maybe we need a side bar with risk reduction and HIV transmission information? ### I agree with what you're saying.  I have seen these posts and responded to a few of them. 

Yes, I think there should be a FAQ or at the very least a link to a decent article on levels of risk such as http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/topics/basic/#spread

However, talk of deleting the posts crosses a line into doing harm.

The people who come here asking these questions are suffering and they are legitimately afraid.  Having been a young gay man who knew little about HIV/AIDS in the late 80s and early 90s, I can relate to this fear on a visceral level. 

The answer isn't abandonment, it's education. 

So a nice FAQ, and a few people who are willing to provide advice to those who ask should help a bit.

Frankly, the attitude of ""If I keep seeing this I'm going to unsubscribe"" sickens me. If these posts offend you so much, then hide them or don't click on them or don't respond to them. Simple as that.  ### As someone who experienced massive HIV anxiety last year from a very low risk ie. basically no risk encounter last year. I can say with certainty that anxiety is very capable of creating allot of your 'symptoms'. It'll leave you a mess. The only real way to relieve you of your crippling anxiety is to get tested with the most accurate test you can get your hands on, so you can't ask what if. 

If you have a serious risk get tested at 6 weeks and again at 3 months, with a third or four generation Elisa. And if you had a major risk go to your nearest ER ASAP after the encounter and get on preventative drugs, not tomorrow or the day after, immediately! You only have a tiny window of 72 hours post exposure, the sooner the better though. I'd also recommend you go the hospital in your area that has the most experience with HIV exposure and research if possible, they will have access to the most current knowledge and research and assess your risk better.  ### I second all of this. I would rather see this subreddit be about HIV research and questions related to HIV to be answered by HIV experts or HIV patients. I nearly unsubscribe to this every time I see a paranoid hypochondriac stressing about whether or not s/he has HIV after every sexual encounter they have.  ### My girlfriend was diagnosed with HIV a few days ago. My results come in tomorrow.

I'm scared.

I don't want her to get sick and die. I want to be healthy and normal. I don't want to be bound to her by this and I don't want to leave her like this.

Yes, I've already sat through the ""HIV isn't a death sentence anymore"" bit.

There is no happy path here, life has handed us a really shitty deal.

I'm not OK ### Hello, I think I'd fit the description but you are being really harsh on people with anxiety.

I'm currently waiting results for my HIV test (third world public health system is slow, excellent but slow) I've confirmed that my exposure was minimal  to negligible. Yet anxiety don't work that way, and perhaps it's should be considered like a disease itself. 

I've had extreme stress anxiety since 3 years ago, which gave me horrible urticaria, eczema, sleep deprivation, extreme weight loss and more that sometimes can take up to a month. 

 I'm still scared (and I'll be scared until I receive my test results) but through a lot of effort I've managed to keep myself together and searching relief in more informed people than me has helped. Even started considering that if even against all odds my test results came positive, it's perhaps something that I can live with, and seeing the struggle that people with HIV do has helped me to rationalize my fear and remind me that even if everything  goes wrong, living it's worth the effort.

So please, bear with us, we may be annoying, but you aren't in our shoes. You don't know why this anxiety exists for us, you don't know which stage of our lives are we living, and you don't know how are we feeling. If I could stop feeling this way believe me that I'd do it.  ### [removed] ### I'm the mod over at /r/hivaids which has a few more subs and I've been thinking exactly that. a large number of posters are as you said. I think I'm going to do a post soliciting advice for this FAQ then link it in the sidebar.  ### Yeah I am behind on some of that and have been working on redoing it. ### I'm freaking out. I've been trying to figure out the risk of infection rate from my first and only homosexual encounter. My bottoming lasted a minute, there was no precum due to oral and no ejaculations. However I have hemorrhoids and those did bleed later on in the day, not sure when. I saw my random partner with a condom on but I wasn't sure if they had it on as they were behind me. I'm freaking out and went on PEP. What's the chance I will catch hiv? It was a Transgendered Asian American.  ### Your fear is completely logical.  Your partner was diagnosed with HIV, therefore, you have most likely been exposed* (note, exposed does *not* necessarily mean infected).  This post was not meant for you.  Any anxiety you are feeling right now would be felt by most people.  

However, the advice I would give you is similar.  You need support.  Seek out an HIV social worker or an HIV case manager to help.  If your test is negative, provide your girlfriend with whatever support you are able to give her.  I can't give you advice on whether you should stay with her or not - only you can make that decision.  I don't know your relationship or your history together.  I can tell you that you would have a future together, and the possibility of marriage, children, etc. if that's what you both want.  You have heard it already, but it is not a death sentence and many people are able to live fairly normal lives and normal lifespans with HIV.  I have many patients who are HIV positive and have negative partners who have stayed negative for years.  However, you're not a bad person if you can't stay with her.  It's scary.  Stigma and discrimination are very real for people with HIV and if you don't HAVE to deal with it, you may choose not to.  

Where do you live?  PM me, I may be able to hook you up with someone who can help.


edit: wordage ### My point was not to be harsh with people with anxiety, my point was for someone to read it and go, ""Wow, that's me....maybe I need to get my anxiety treated.""  

Good luck - I hope that you can get some peace of mind from your test results and have the resources to see a medical professional about your anxiety.  No one should have to live scared all the time.   ### Dear Elliot Patterson.

I just needed to post something somewhere.

For now I'm the HIV negative partner in a serodiscordant relationship. I will retest in 3 months and again in 6. We have been highly sexually active for the 3 months we've been a couple including many instances of activities placing me at extreme risk of infection so although I'm overwhelmed with relief for now I will make efforts to steel myself for a different diagnosis in a few months' time.

I couldn't look at myself in the mirror if I left her because of this - each person of course has to make up their own mind but I would ask myself what kind of a worthless shitbag cunt would leave someone whom they professed to love, in that person's very greatest hour of need. Paradoxically I would expect and encourage her to leave me were our positions reversed.

I'm not leaving her over this. If it means I eventually become infected with HIV then so be it. This I am OK with.

In a way I think I just wanted to know that I hadn't been the one to give it to her. I don't know I could ever forgive myself had that been the case.

Thanks for the offer of help, my doctor co-incidentally is gay and heavily involved with the LGBT community where I live, and has many years of experience with patients living with HIV. I feel I'm in the best of hands with him.

My poor little thing... she's so sweet and adorable, the very last person anyone would ever wish this upon. I will take her strength and make it my own and she will never be alone so long as I draw breath.

18xcvr,"I'm scared... Hello people.

I have something I worry about quite dearly. 3 years ago I had sex with a prostitute(I was young and foolish)in a sex club where I know they get regularly tested for STD's. Anyway, during the act the condom broke and we pretty much noticed it right away, I was exposed for maybe 10 seconds.

Few days after that I coincidentally got a sore throat for a day or two and since then I haven't gotten any other symptoms beside feeling tired once in a while. So I wen't for a blood test to the doctor to find out what could be causing this tiredness and it turned out it's vitamin deficiency. Now I'm not sure if he also tested me on STD's or if the possibility of me being HIV positive would've been obvious from a blood test regardless of the lab workers looking for it directly.

I never even thought of the possibility that I could be hiv positive until my long term gf suddenly has migraines (we've been sleeping together without protection for at least one and a half years.) and when googling what could be causing those migraines HIV came up and so I wen't on to read about the other symptoms of HIV and found out that the sore throat is one of them and as a result now I'm terrified. 

I'm even too scared to get tested because I don't know what I would do if I found out that I gave the person I love most HIV...

I'm scared.",3,2013-02-20 20:56:01-05:00,"Got this from here: http://www.womenshealth.gov/hiv-aids/what-is-hiv-aids/myths-about-hiv-aids.cfm  
It's much harder for men to get HIV from women, but it does happen. HIV does not live long outside the body. A man's penis is only exposed to HIV for the time that it is in a vagina or rectum. Men also may have fewer areas on the penis where the virus can enter the body. HIV can enter at the opening of the tip and through cuts or sores on the shaft. But if a partner has an untreated sexually transmitted infection (STI) like syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia, the risk is higher. These infections can bring more CD4 cells to the area of infection, or cause breaks in the skin, both increasing the risk of passing HIV. Meanwhile, women have a higher risk of getting HIV from men. Because HIV is in the man's semen, which can stay in the woman's vagina for days, her exposure time is longer after sex. Also, the vagina provides a much larger area than the penis does through which HIV can enter the woman's body.

Also, ask them to put you on Atripla.  It's only one pill a day!  The only side effects I've seen so far are vivid dreams and drowsiness.  The dreams stop being so bizarre after a week or two. ### You need to ask your doctor as it depends on how your body is handling the HIV. Are your CD4 numbers stable or decreasing? As your CD4 count gets closer to 200 you are at risk of getting a number of opportunistic infections so if they are going down you should start medications.

If you think you'll have trouble staying on the meds then what you should do is start getting them but don't take the first one for a little while. Maybe start on the second month and keep the first months bottle as an emergency backup.  ### well i have trouble with the dreams so im not getting on that. Isnt anything under 100,000 pretty good though? the problem is because of ryan white, and the fact that i am planning on moving idk where id get meds once i moved or how id get that set up.

18klkm,"Needing support  Hey guys,
 
HIV/AIDS was not even on my radar until the past couple of months when my friend kept stressing for me to get tested. As a 20 year-old gay male, the thought of HIV settled in my head and has caused nothing but stress and anxiety since. I have had unprotected sex with two men the past year, both who have claimed to be HIV negative; however, with my boyfriend of 5 months who was a virgin before we met, I can no longer carry the burden of possibly endangering his life. Especially as us both being in the closet in regards to family life.
 
The past year I have been healthy with no ARS symptoms whatsoever. There have been a couple strange things though.
 
Dry, patchy, itchy skin along my neck and face. These patches came and went for a period of 3 or so months. They only existed when I was at school and would disappear after only a couple days of being at home with my family. I concluded that it was perhaps something to do with the water or another allergen within my apartment. My skin is perfectly normal now.
Tonsil stones. Disgusting little things. I recently started having at least one a day or more for a while now... Throat feels fine and looks okay. I had tonsillitis in the last year and went to the doctor to get diagnosed. Everything was in order and the doctor had no other suspicions. Tonsil stones are still a disgusting part of my everyday life even today.
Ear infection. Never had one until last year. Came and went in a week or so. No other symptoms besides feeling deaf in one ear, haha.
 
I have already discussed the matter with my boyfriend. He comforted me saying that there have been poz/neg couples and it can work and that how if he was also positive, it didn't even matter then. He promised he'd love me either way and that he could not be angry at me. I just hope that if I am positive, this be the case.
 
I went to get tested a few days ago through my school's free testing program. Guess how long I have to wait for results? 2-3 weeks. 2-3 weeks of agony and worrying. What a broken system this is. Anywho, I decided to bite the bullet and get tested because it is the responsible thing to do.
 
Another person who I had unprotected sex with (I both topped and bottomed) a handful of times got tested about 1 month ago. I told him to keep in touch and he called to let me know he was negative. Although comforting, his results are not entirely conclusive to my own case. My boyfriend and I have had unprotected sex... many times. He has exhibited no signs of an infection and has been perfectly healthy the entirety of our relationship thus far with no ARS.
 
If it's relevant, I took Accutane last year as well where there was routine blood work. This blood work (to my understanding) does not test for STDs or HIV; however, it does monitor other irregularities in blood work. Each doctors visit went smoothly and I was healthy in that respect.
 
I'm not sure how worried I should be. I came here to get things off my chest and make myself feel a little better. I think the worst part of it all is wondering what consequences I may face by endangering my boyfriend's life as well as mine. There's just so much to dwell on! I'm not sure how to make time go any faster. I just want to hear my results and move on. I want to feel safe but it's hard when you know you've made unwise decisions in the past.
 
Can anyone give me their thoughts/opinions? Should I be worried? Is it likely I have HIV? Thanks a ton!",3,2013-02-15 02:54:50-05:00,"Getting HIV isn't as easy as you might think.

However, you can make it even harder by making sure that you use condoms every time you're with anyone whose status you aren't certain of. 

You can get a rapid test.  Is there an LGBT community center near you? If you are in the US, there is a good deal of funding from the Ryan White CARE Act for free confidential HIV tests for people in high risk groups. Being a man who has sex with men (MSM) means that  you should qualify.  Where I am, we have rapid tests which take 20 minutes.   

So if you can, contact your LGBT center and find out about HIV testing and get it done and out of the way.  Or, as pheel23 said, if you have the funds, go buy a rapid test.  

It is hard to tell by symptoms because the early symptoms are those of a weakened immune system.  A cold can give you a weakened immune symptom.  Also, when you are worried about it, every little blemish or cough means that you've got AIDS.  Don't worry about it, its unlikely.

Even if you did  have it, it wouldn't be the end of the world. Modern medications (Anti-retrovirals) are very good at keeping the virus down and keeping the immune system up. It sucks to have to take meds every day, and being worried about infecting someone is no fun...but these things are manageable.  ### It's not to likely. The ""flu"" is the normal seroconversion symptom and i didn't see that listed. not everyone gets the ""flu though. Go to cvs get a rapid test kit for $25 and save yourself weeks of worry. I am at work so I can't write more but if you need more info pm me later. As a lesson don't take anyone's word for their HIV status, you are the only one looking out for you. Condoms aren't so bad.   ### Definitely! And you are oh-so right. I am NEVER taking anyone's word for it again and after this scare I will not put my life or other peoples' life in danger. ### ",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIV/comments/18klkm/needing_support/
188dx1,Chances of catching HIV giving unprotected oral sex (blowjob only)? Curious. Any input is appreciated. ,5,2013-02-09 23:51:05-05:00,"It is not impossible. It *is* extremely unlikely.

The way it has been explained to me is this: practically *all* cases where a man has claimed to have been infected from oral sex, the man also engaged in vaginal or anal sex with a poz partner. Last I heard, there is no record of any person who received HIV from oral alone. Even women who claim to have received HIV from oral sex have admitted to engaging in penetrative sex also. So it has been very, very, tough for researchers to pinpoint *any* transmission of HIV through oral sex alone.

Studies of serodiscordant relationships where the woman is neg and her male partner is poz have shown that women don't catch HIV from giving oral. Those that have contracted HIV from their partners have admitted to engaging in penetrative sex with those partners. 

So there are no 100%-you're-never-gonna-get-HIV stats that say oral is 110% safe. No doc is going to tell you there is zero chance of you catching HIV by engaging in oral sex. 

Even if someone HIV+ is on meds, their viral load is undetectable (not zero-there's a difference) there is a minute chance you can contract HIV by giving oral. Not a non-existent chance, just very small.

Receiving oral from an HIV+ person carries even less risk than giving oral does.  ### Here is the per act probability of acquiring HIV per sexual act, according to the CDC. 

The chances of becoming infected through a single blowjob (receptive or insertive) is low. 

http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/law/transmission.htm

""HIV transmission through oral sex has been documented, but rare. Accurate estimates of risk are not available."" ### One thing that people *do* need to do is practice oral hygiene. Other than that, what everybody else said is correct. ### Yep, just look at the numbers. There is only a 5 or 10 (depending if you are male or female) out of 10,000 chance of getting hiv even if you have unprotected sex with an hiv positive person.

You probably have some first time jitters...no big deal, you'll get over it, just be safe! ### ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIV/comments/188dx1/chances_of_catching_hiv_giving_unprotected_oral/

17zp6v,"Questions about my HIV Test. Please help! (xpost /STD) So some back story so you guys know where I am coming from. On January 16th I had a sexual encounter with a female escort. I arrived at her house and we started to have sexual intercourse. She performed oral sex on me unprotected and then had protected sex with me. We also kissed for about 10 seconds. Stupid thing is I decided to go down on her after and perform oral sex on this female. The room was barely lit but from what I could see I could not see anything wrong with her genital region. There were no warts or cuts and I could not feel anything out of the ordinary. This went on for about 2 mins and then I decided to perform the 69 position with her. During this position I performed oral sex on her and by accident swallowed some of her vaginal fluid. She was also spitting into a cup as she was giving me oral sex, which I found very odd. After we had protected sex and I left. The next day after when I went to go brush my teeth I noticed a blemish on the top and bottoms of my lip. They seem to be several maybe 20-30 white little spots clustered together under the skin. I was very concerned and told a friend about it. He said that it probably was a cold sore and recommended using Lipactin from a local drug store. I used this for about 2 days and found no results. During that 2nd day of the use I started to feel flu like symptoms. I had a sore throat and had trouble sleeping. I would get the chills in the middle of the night. So on January 20th I decided to go in to the walk-in clinic (as I did not have a family doctor) and the doctor diagnosed me for strep throat. She took 3 different swabs, checking for throat gonorrhea, throat chlamydia and strep. As she finished this she prescribed me antibiotics (Penicillin) to take 2 tablets twice daily and just to apply alcohol to my blemishes on my lip. She always advised me to call Public Health Services to get tested. The next day after I went to another doctor for my lip just to see what they had to say. This doctor prescribed me Zovirax Ointment. I used the ointment until it was finished like the doctor said but found no results. During this week I finished my antibiotics and felt as good as new but still had my blemish the same size as I had it the first day. On January 29th I went to go get tested for Herpes Simplex Virus, Hep B, HIV, Gonorrhea and Chlamydia through blood and urine samples. The doctors there said it would take about two weeks for the results to come in. So where I stand now is on February 2nd. Today I went into the doctors as I felt my throat acting up again feeling like it was sore or swollen again. The walk in clinic doctor said I should be fine and probably isn't Herpes, since I've had it for more than 2 weeks and it hasn't opened up yet. His guess was it could of just been a skin reaction to her vagina. I highly doubt that it would be since the blemish looks so different from everything else I've ever seen. I also asked him if it was ok if I kissed anyone while I had these blemishes and he said it was ok as long as I took care of it. [Stopped smoking, stopped eating spicy foods and no alcohol] He also said to apply vaseline on my lips. So the doctor checked my throat and found nothing wrong but I know for a fact that it is hard to swallow food or drink water as of right now. It feels like the first time I had started feeling symptoms of strep.

So basically I just want to know: What these blemishes on my lip could be, and how could I treat them. What are the chances of me contracting an STD orally. And what are the chances of contracting HIV through oral sex with this partner.

I feel very scared and vulnerable at this point. Every night since I had these symptoms its been hard to keep this off my mind. I am constantly thinking about it and searching on the net for more information. Every night it is hard for me to sleep thinking about this. I usually wake up around 3 or 4 am and just can't sleep. I've been to 4 doctors and still don't have solid information. I hope you Redditors can help me out. Thanks in advance.

**I copy pasted most of the information from my post on /r/STD . But now my main concern is really the HIV test that I got back. How accurate is my HIV test. I took a 4th generation HIV combo test (HIV1/2Ag/Ab) and no HIV p24 antigen and no HIV1/2 antibodies were detected.**

*My results came back negative.*

 I got tested exactly 2 weeks after I was suspicious of catching an STD or HIV. Does anyone know when I should go in for testing again just to make sure? I researched the internet that the 4th gen test detects the antibodies as early as 1-4 weeks after infection and for the safe side I should go in at 6 week mark. So what I am basically asking is, should I feel at ease now that the test came back negative after 2 weeks or should I still have a little concern until I take that 6 week test. As I am writing this I have severe stomach pains and I am having the feeling of vomiting. If someone could please respond with a little information I would be very happy and appreciative.** It is really hard to cope with this. My doctor said a 3 month test or even a 6 month test will be way more accurate. But as I said I don't know if I could deal with all this anxiety, stress and symptoms until then. I don't know anymore. I thought I was a strong person. I broke down today and cried over this whole ordeal. For christ sake I am only 20 years old and this is happening over the span of my birthday which is on the 18th of February. If anyone could please tell me anything, I would greatly appreciate it. ",14,2013-02-06 04:14:01-05:00,"The results are very accurate, you should get tested every 3 months as that is the size of the current window period, it could just be a coincidence with the timing  as HIV symtoms take some time to show up it could be a form of strep Penicillin will not do shit for it in most cases,( i have been their it sucks).
so here are a few thing you can do to ease your mind
1 if you are still having problems swallowing I would sugest seeing an ENT  they specialize in tat department 
2 if you still have the sores ask your doctor to have cultures sent out that will tell you exactly what you are dealing with if it is CA MRSA ask for bactrim

3 find your state in this list http://hab.hrsa.gov/gethelp/statehotlines.html they will find you someone to talk to.   ### One thing that should put you at ease is that HIV is not going to show symptoms as quickly as you saw them. At the very least it would take a week for the virus to load in your system enough to cause flu-like symptoms. Usually it takes between 2 weeks and a few months. 

So if you are basing your suspicions of infection on the spots in your mouth (24 hours later) and the flu-like symptoms (3 days later). These symptoms are unlikely to have been caused by an HIV infection from this partner. You were diagnosed with Strep.  That symptom is explained.

You seem to be experiencing a great deal of anxiety over this.  This anxiety itself could very easily cause a few of the symptoms you mentioned...

Here's a few things to consider:

It is unlikely that you have HIV.  HIV isn't that easy to get.  Obviously it's not impossible, but the odds of you getting HIV from the activities you described are fairly low.

Your initial two week test came back negative.  This is a very good thing.  Again, it's not definitive, but in combination with the low risk activities you described, it strengthens the case against HIV. 

Follow your Dr's instructions.  Get a test at 3 or 6 months just to be sure. But don't stress over it.

Finally...

If you did get HIV it would not be the end of the world.  I work with dozens of people every single day who have HIV and they're, for the most part, healthy and happy people. They have to be careful with sex and other body fluid related stuff.  They have to take pills every day and those pills can have different side effects.  The newer generation of pills has fewer of those. The cost of the medications and medical care are taken care of by Ryan White funds for those who can't afford it (In the US).  It is not only possible to live a full life with HIV, with good medication adherence and a healthy lifestyle, it's become the norm. 

It would be an adjustment, but it wouldn't be the end of the world.  So with that knowledge, release that fear.  You aren't facing a death sentence...regardless of your diagnosis.

But, as I said, the likelihood that you've been infected with HIV is pretty low.

Stop having unprotected oral sex with prostitutes.  That's just a bad choice. Keep seeing the doc about your symptoms...it's possible that your strep is back...see the doc about that.  I have no idea what to tell you about your lip sores.  ### Penicillin did work but after I finished my prescription, it came back. Now they prescribed me a stronger antibiotic. I've been on it for 3 days but see no signs of improvement. If anything it is getting worse. When I used the penicillin it worked in the first 2 days. I also live in Canada so the sources you provided me wont be too helpful for me. I honestly thank you so much for replying back to me. It means so much. I feel so alone in this. I can't really talk to anyone about it since it is such delicate matter. Every time I think about it, I think about all the people I care about and how hard it is going to be for them if I have HIV. It's very hard to look at my mom without getting teary eyed. 

And again I apologize for all of this. I'm just very scared and suffering from anxiety. I don't know if I can make that 3 month mark. I definetly am going to go at the 6 week then the 3 month. Can I rest a little easier at the 6 week mark with the 4th gen combo HIV test? (If they do come back negative) ### That's the thing I am at that 3 week mark and I've been to numerous of doctors saying it can be numerous things. No one knows what's wrong with my throat. I've been taking this new antibiotic for 3 days but I am seeing no results. Another doctor also prescribed me a gargling solution. I've also had no results with those. If anything it is getting worse. I really don't have that much concern for my lip lesions since all my std tests came back negative. My main concern is HIV. I am a fairly healthy 20 year old man. I never get sick like this, and for this to happen all after the sexual encounter, it really scares me. Usually when I head to the doctors they give me something and I'm good in no time.  ### first off my friend from the north http://www.cdnaids.ca/hotlinesandsupport  
ok now for the 3 month mark thing, not waiting will not give you now information with most clinics the tests the use have that window period, but the chances of infection from oral sex are low compared to other activities I can look up some numbers given some time.

now for the antibiotic issue - the penicillin did not really make it go away it just seemed like it ( well some of what ever it was was resistant) the ""stronger"" may work in a different way then the penicillin and you will have to give it time after day 5 I would call the md and let them know that you are not getting better.
did your doctor send out samples to be cultured ? that will be the best way to determine what is going on. ### Well, my first thought is that your anxiety could be playing a pretty big role.  But, it could be something else. It's probably not HIV. 

Of course, I can't diagnose HIV or anything over the computer, nor can your mind be set at ease by anyone but yourself.

I am a gay man, I turned 18 in 1990, smack dab in the middle of AIDS carnage. The only thing I saw on the news was gay men dying of AIDS. I didn't have sex with anyone for a long time. When I finally did, the guy found out about 3 months later that he was HIV positive and we'd been having a pretty steady sexual relationship. 

I lived in a small town and knew nothing about HIV/AIDS other than it killed people.  I went, eventually about 5 months later, to get the test.  I was sure that I had it.  For five months, every sniffle and every blemish on my body was proof.

The test took 2 weeks.  It came back negative.

So, I get the stress...believe me.

It sucks that you've got all these unexplained symptoms. That would be upsetting.  You may have gotten something from her.  Have the docs checked for MRSA? Ask about that.  It's the only thing that you didn't mention that comes to mind. 

If you have HIV, you have it.  If you don't, you don't. There is nothing that your worrying about it is going to change. 

You have to accept, mentally, that if damage is done, it's already done. 

HIV is not likely.  It could be something else.  Take the full course of the anti-biotic.  Go back to the THAT doc if the symptoms don't get better and try the next thing.  Medicine is a trial and error thing.  It's a lot of ""Try this, and if it doesn't work, we'll try this, and it it doesn't work, then we'll try this, and if it doesn't work....""   

So you should stop doc hopping.  Find one you can trust and stick with them. Different docs have different experiences and it will make you crazy.

Last thing.  Don't underestimate the effects of anxiety on your body. Talk to your doc about the anxiety this is causing.  Anxiety can cause physical symptoms. 

You're going to be okay.  Just trust your docs and try to do some pleasant things and see what you can do about this anxiety. ### He did do culture swabs. They came back and were negative for throat Gonnorhea and I am now awaiting my results for the throat Chlyamidia. My concern now is that I woke up with a white substance on my tongue. I searched it up and believe it is oral thrush. One of the symptoms of HIV infection. It is also a symptom of taking antibiotics. I'm hoping it is from the antibiotics. I called my dentist today and have an appointment for 3:15 so he can diagnose it. If he does say it is oral thrush i am going to go see my family doctor again. I also researched that oral thrush can develop in the esaphagus. If that is the case that at least I can pinpoint what is wrong with my throat. ### Thanks for the support I really appreciate it from you and the other person posting on my thread. It gives me a little more comfort. Like I said before to the other person posting. I think I have developed oral thrush at the back of my tongue. I am going to the dentist today at 3:15 so he can diagnose it. I also heard that it can develop in the esaphagus. I don't know if it could be a good thing of bad thing that I find this out but if it is, then I at least pinpointed my problem in my throat. If something does go wrong at the dentist I will contact my same family doctor again and get his opinion. And I am sorry you went through the same thing I am going though. No one should ever have to experience this pain and suffering. I've definitely learned my lesson and will stay true to my sexual life and well being. ### thrush is fairly common I have had it, also the white stuff could be from reflux, try not to freek out to much for now as you can not do alot till all the result are in. did your doctor take swabs for non STI related bugs ? ### Yeah the first time I went in, 4 days after exposure they did a strep swab it came back and it did indicate I have strep. It was treated and I have throat problems again.  ### Strep can be rather resilient, and can take more then one round of antibiotics if the strain is unknown. give the antibiotics some time. ### Hopefully! Well I just got back from the dentist and he said that it is not oral thrush. I think that's a good thing. I'll try to keep waiting for the antibiotics to work I guess. ### keep us updated  ### Ok so I finally finished my appointment with a dermatologist. He did indeed label my lesions as ""Fordyce Spots"" and they are completely harmless.

17irde,"HIV Blood Testing... results other than HIV show up? At a standard medical clinic in the United States, I am due to go in for an HIV blood test. I am certain I am negative, as my last test was 1 year ago.. and I have kept the same partner. 

That aside, will any other items in my blood stream (i.e. Alcohol, THC, Creatine, etc) show up on the result of this test, or will it be a Positive/Negative result only?

The reason I ask is because this test is for one of my potential employers (new job, yeah!!) and they may frown on that. Would wait an extra couple of weeks if so... but they prefer the results ASAP....

(I have googled this to no avail, thought you all may know)

Face it people, what happened in the 80s is a completely different thing than what they are claiming is HIV/AIDS today. What happened in the 80s was rapid and targeted. It did not act like a disease. It acted like a deliberate poisoning of the gay population, with rapid effects. It was compounded by the US Governments suggestion to take LETHAL AMOUNTS OF AZT that would quickly kill the patient.  Look at the threads of people who survived that time. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO REFUSED TO TAKE THE MEDICATIONS!

14493e,"HIV Reddit: how does the rest of the HIV/AIDS community feel about ""bug chasers"" and ""gift givers""? I recently heard about the phenomena of ""bugchasing"", people who deliberately seek out being infected by HIV and/or AIDS, and ""gift givers"", people who desire to infect people with HIV and/or AIDS. It gave me a lot of conflicting and strange feelings. On the one hand, I believe that consenting adults should be allowed to do as they'd please, and that if someone wants to get infected, that is their prerogative. On that end, I can't say I ethically oppose someone facilitating that by infecting someone consensually. On the other hand, it is problematic for all the obvious reasons. How are these people viewed within the HIV/AIDS community?

",4,2012-12-01 15:48:19-05:00,"Personally, I think it's a bit crazy to want to have HIV. I couldn't possibly pass it on to someone, I couldn't ethically do it. I feel like 'bug chasers' perhaps don't get the gravity of how HIV can change your life. It's always going to be an awkward decision whether to tell someone you are having sex with (unprotected of course) whether or not to tell them. And when you start dating someone, when do you tell them? If you tell them too early they might leave and need give you a chance but if you tell them to late they might be angry that you didn't give them opportunity to decide whether they would sleep with you or not. ### Opinion: bug chasers are crazy nut jobs. ### And have no respect for life.

HIV infection costs tons of money to any country's health care system.

It's not a choice that affects only you, it's a selfish one.

And as a person I don't see how where's the joy in infecting others either. This world is just sick. ### alex jones should chase them up ### ",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIV/comments/14493e/hiv_reddit_how_does_the_rest_of_the_hivaids/

In the USA, AIDS is still defined by either an AIDS defining illness OR a CD4 count of less than 200.  

""Full blown AIDS"" was used to describe someone who had an AIDS diagnosis.  We don't use it in the medical community anymore, because it implies that someone will be very sick and/or die soon.  We are now able to improve immune systems easily enough that an AIDS diagnosis doesn't mean the same thing it did 15 years ago. ### In Australia it's based on aids defining illness not cd4 count anymore, sorry I wasn't aware it could still be cd4 count in the states. ### Gotcha....

112z2q,Question for an answer I can't find on Google What's the HIV transmission rate for gay men (receptive positive and insertive negative) both on antivirals and using condoms?,2,2012-10-07 05:35:58-04:00,"Try thebody.com. They have a lot of resources on there. I distinctly recall a video series they did maybe a year ago that stated that the transmission rates after having an undetectable viral load go down significantly- I can't recall figures though. Furthermore, condoms are safe, there is a theoretical risk that the virus is small enough to go between the weaving of the condom but I've never come across any data to suggest this actually happens. Hope you find what you are after! ### While it doesn't directly answer your question, look at the HPTN052 study. 

It was done in a heterosexual serodiscordant population, but it should parallel results seen in MSM. 

Basically, the study looked at hetersoexual couples in which one partner was HIV positive and the other HIV negative. They gave the positive partner antiretroviral therapy either immediately or they waited until their CD4 count dropped below 250 cells/mm3 and then looked at the rate at which the uninfected partner became infected.

The study showed that there was a 96% decrease in HIV transmission when antiretroviral therapy was started right away, suggesting that effective antiretroviral therapy stops HIV transmission as long as RNA levels are undetectable.

The other study for you to look at is the iPrex trial, which specifically looked at preexposure prophylaxis in MSM. This was kind of the opposite design of the HPTN052 study - again they look at MSM couples in which one partner was HIV positive and the other HIV negative. This time, it was the uninfected partner who received antiretroviral therapy. They looked at the rate at which the uninfected partner became HIV positive and found that there was a 92% decrease in the risk of becoming infected with HIV in HIV-1 people who actually took the drug (eg, had detectable levels of drug in their blood). 

There are several other studies that address what you are asking, but these are the most recent that I know of.  ### ",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIV/comments/112z2q/question_for_an_answer_i_cant_find_on_google/

vhzhl,"Partner Said He's Positive - Now I'm Freaking Out. Essentially, yesterday at around 6pm, someone I had sex with before (I'm gay, and was the bottom, and we used a condom) called and said he's tested positive for HIV. He has a boyfriend now, and he tested negative. We had sex around the end of March, and he tested negative in April. He also says that me and his boyfriend are the only two people he's slept with in about 9 months, except for a blowjob he says he used a condom for. We used a condom as well.
I was dealing with this fine, as I thought I would be able to go to Planned Parenthood this morning and get tested, but they don't do testing on the weekends. The only place that I can find that might is the Hospital, and they won't release your results for two days so they can get a confirmatory diagnosis. On top of that, they charge a bunch for emergency care fees.
I haven't been tested in about a year, but I keep freaking out that somehow I was the one who gave it to him. If he's being truthful about not sleeping with anyone else, the timeline just makes sense (it takes about 3 months from the point of infection to tell). I know the chances of transmission are low from bottom to top, especially with a condom, but I can't find anything definitive online. One of my friends got drunk with my last night in an attempt to calm me down until this morning, but now I don't think I'll be able to get tested until monday/tuesday, and I have no idea how to wait that long.

To begin I appreciate any answers...

A couple weeks ago I went to a rave, ended up doing MDMA. And chewing my lips. No bleeding wounds but ended up with swollen lips and the skin coming off on the inside. I shared a bottle of water with quite a few people. I don't think there is a chance and am probably working my self up into a panic. But I was recently tested and it came back negative, (this was before the rave). However, I've come down with some cold like symptoms such as a plugged nose and itchy throat. And I had unprotected sex with my wife and she has the same cold maybe a little worse. Chance of exposure?

The sex only lasted about 5 mins maybe, because I was too big for him. Eventually we both came on ourselves and that was that.

1ok9eb,"POZ partner for 9 months and ORAQUICK HIV test. Hi I have a question for any experts out there. I'm a 20 year old male, I was with a 38 year old poz male for 9 months and we had sex regularly (but usually with a condom) over that period of time. I did in fact have unprotected anal sex (he did not ejaculate inside of me any time) with him ~3 times (drunk every time. nice job me!) and swallowed his semen probably about 10-15 times. The only reason I did this other than being drunk was that he's had HIV for 11 years and has been completely undetectable for 6. I have read that the risk involved with someone who has been undetectable for a long time is close to nothing even with unprotected sex.

So we broke up about a month and a half ago and I bought an ORAQUICK test off of Amazon. The packet said that there is an increased chance of inaccuracy unless you wait 3 months. I thought screw it I need some kind of peace of mind and took the test.

Negative. Whew. Relief. Still though, should I still be concerned over my status? Am I being overly paranoid or should I go get a legitimate blood test? I don't want to be irresponsible but I feel like the chances are soooo low that it may be over kill.

Talk some sense in me guys/girls. Thanks!",10,2013-10-16 04:51:00-04:00,"i think you did the right thing and im glad u were smart to knwo that an undetectable person is actually a good choice. I think youll be find and i really hope more young guys will accept the pozness. So ill give you lots of up votes for it. And if your in California ill say hi lol ### Case in point, this is why people wonder if all gay men have aids. Are you fucking kidding me? ### I'd also like to add I've had 0 symptoms of flu/hiv/or whatever else the entire time I've been with him leading up until now. I have not been sick once. 

*Oh and one more thing that may be unclear: I took the test today, not right after we broke up. I'd say it's been about a month and a half since the last ""risk"" even though it was protected sex. ### I find it pretty sad that there is STILL a stigma for poz men in the GAY community. Especially for men that are on medication and have been undetectable for years.

I feel like, why even walk out of your house if you're *that* afraid of catching something, you know? Not only is the associated risk next to nothing, HIV is an entirely treatable and maintainable ailment that you can live to be a healthy old man with if you're responsible with it. People don't get that its not a death sentence anymore. Medications have came such a long way since the 70s.

Do I want it? Not at all. But I'm not going to let it get in the way if I want to explore a relationship with someone.

At the same time, I want to be sure of my status before I pursue other relationships. I don't want to be the guy that gives someone else HIV. ### The fact that I'm concerned over it and that I'm looking for guidance should probably make you feel a bit better.

I would not have sex with another person unless I was 99.99% sure I was negative. I'll admit I'm not highly educated on all things HIV, but I'm looking to learn.

Also, you probably shouldn't base your negative stereotypes off of one person's post to reddit. If you go out in search of reenforcing almost any stereotype you'll find a match somewhere.

Also, fuck off. ### I disagree - I am able to enjoy and explore a relationship safely using condoms. We still had good sex. In my opinion bareback + swallowing cum is not ""exploring a relationship"". I guess different strokes different blokes. Anyway I think you should get a proper test still - no harm in doing that! Good luck!  ### and i think that is a very healthy attitude especially in young people, so go out and spread the news. lol ### Not what I meant. Some people won't pursue a relationship with someone pos at all. ### OH I thought you were talking about bareback or ""unsafe"" sex being ok once the persons viral load is undetectable lol. ### Nah. haha

I used protection the large majority of the time. I just think its silly that people refuse to try a relationship with poz guy at all. Way to limit your options.  ### ",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIV/comments/1ok9eb/poz_partner_for_9_months_and_oraquick_hiv_test/

wq030,"Reddit, my brother and his wife are trying to adopt an HIV+ child would you be willing to help?
 If this is the wrong subreddit for this, kindly redirect me.

Dear Reddit,
My brother and his wife are currently in the process of adopting a little boy from Uganda. They've been going through this process for a few years.
Here's a little back story.
A year ago, my brother and his wife realized how ridiculously comfortable their lives were. They felt convicted about this and decided to try to share their comfort with children who have literally nothing. They raised money and went to see orphans, both abandoned and parent less, in Uganda. Whilst in Uganda they met a little boy named Paul, who was HIV positive between 6 and 8 years old, who weighed around 30 lbs if I remember correctly. He stole their hearts.
They worked with people there to get him moved to a better orphanage, and started the process of adopting him. 
Sadly, the laws there prevented them from being the right family for them. Their hearts were broken, but they weren't ready to stop trying.
Some friends of theirs new of another little boy in need of a family, also HIV positive, in Uganda, available for adoption. They enthusiastically pursued this. 
Back to present day. The type of adoption is different, initially they were doing a private adoption, but for Levi, it had to be through the agencies. Meaning more expensive and much more fast paced, due to his condition and age.
Basically, what I'm asking is if you feel so called, help them out with 1$ and maybe if we get enough 1$ donations, they can meet their goal.
They need I $14,000 by September to be able to go and get their new son.
Also, wanted to include that HIV+ babies have a much harder time getting adopted even though the condition is completely manageable. 
here is a [link](http://www.projecthopeful.org/waiting-kids/matched-children-and-families#Levi) to donate tax deductible. The link provides more details.
My husband and I are both posting this for more exposure.


TLDR: My brother is trying to adopt from Uganda, Adoption is expensive. Looking to reddit to help out.

Thanks Reddit for being Awesome

1dnd7v,Safe Sex (HIV Home Test) - Not for Those Squeamish at Blood ,4,2013-05-03 19:04:51-04:00,"It doesn't hurt to get tested! Just a tiny bit, haha. Glad you did it! ### Getting tested is great, but this isn't the best video for how to do a DBS (dry blood spot).

* You should hold the safety lancet with your other hand while using it. Don't brace it against the table.

* Try not to touch your finger to the DBS card

It is great to get tested! Knowing is better. However, I feel the way he talks about getting tested almost gives the impression that it will keep him ""safe at the club"". Testing does not prevent HIV. 

Thanks for sharing. ### If anyone with aversion to blood is squeamish to **this** , you'll hate having HIV.  3 to 5 vials of blood several weeks apart for 3 to 6 months, then quarterly and maybe if your medication is stable and well tolerated it will go down to 3 to 5 vials twice a year.  ### i can fap to this ### ",0,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyCQxXV9FHc&feature=share
1m4eey,"Exposure to hiv has me freaking out Two days ago I was at outside a store smoking a cig, when a bummy looking guy walked by and asked to borrow my lighter. I said sure, let him borrow it and we started talking. In the middle of the conversation my friend walks up and shakes the guys hand. The guy says ""ouch, careful; I have a cut"" and showed us a nasty looking cut across his finger.

We keep chatting and after 5 or so minutes, the guy says he is HIV positive.

We left quickly after that and drove to a Waffle House and washed our hands. 

Starting the morning after, I have a stuffy nose.

I am very paranoid. How likely is it that I rubbed my eye after shaking this mans hand and contracted this disease? I can't remember if I touched my face or not before learning of his HIV.. My cuticles get dry and peel sometimes but there weren't open wounds on my hands.. I am pretty freaked out right now and any advice would be very much appreciated.",11,2013-09-10 14:54:22-04:00,"Unless you slipped and accidentally fucked him I'd say you're fine.   ### You had no exposure to HIV.  No one has ever, ever, EVER in the history of humankind been infected with HIV this way.  You have a cold.  That's it. ### You're chances of getting HIV from him if you had unprotected sex with him is 1/1000. You can stop worrying.  ### Even if you did get it (which you didn't), symptoms wouldn't start to show until a few weeks after - not the morning after.

Frankly, the symptoms of acute HIV infection are shared with the common cold/flue/etc that using the ""I got a cold after doing X"" - that there is a pretty damn high chance you simply have a cold. Toss in paranoia and overanalyzing everything --- your fine. ### I know it may sound silly. I don't know all that much about the disease other than it's transmitted though blood and/or other bodily fluids. 

But I really am worried about it. I down know why it's bugging me so much but it is. Maybe it wouldn't so much if I didn't catch this fucking cold 2 days after it happened. ### [deleted] ### Trust me, you don't need to worry about THAT exposure.  You washed your hands, that's what you needed to do and it's done.  Also, seroconversion takes longer than two days to manifest for most.  That said, go get tested! You can buy a rapid test at the pharmacy or you can hit up a free clinic if you don't have insurance.  

I'm not saying you shouldn't be worried about getting HIV, everyone should.  I'm saying you should know more about how you could possibly get it and how to avoid it. Knowledge is power! ### Are you responding to me?  ### I was but I had misread what you wrote and thought your stat was referring to his story above.  In any case, the rate is more like 1/400,00 for unknown status contacts and unprotected vaginal sex. ### Ah.. I was talking about the rate for MSM receptive, but whose counting? :p ### We would be in much closer agreement then! ### yeah :D ### ",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIV/comments/1m4eey/exposure_to_hiv_has_me_freaking_out/
