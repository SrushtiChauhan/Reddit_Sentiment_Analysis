q4zeo1,"Please read this before posting about feeling suicidal. There has been an increase in the number of posts of individuals who are feeling suicidal. And to be perfectly honest, it‚Äôs the beginning of a new school year, most of us have been isolated, scared, lonely, and there‚Äôs a lot of uncertainty in the world due to COVID.

Unfortunately, most of us in this community are not trained to handle mental health crises. While I and a handful of others are licensed professionals, an anonymous internet forum is not the best place to really provide the correct amount of help and support you need.

That being said, I‚Äôm not surprised that many of us in this community are struggling. For those who are struggling, you are not alone. I may be doing well now, but I have two attempts and OCD was a huge factor.

I have never regretted being stopped.

Since you are thinking of posting for help, you won't regret stopping yourself.

So, right now everything seems dark and you don‚Äôt see a way out. That‚Äôs ok. However, I guarantee you there is a light. Your eyes just have not adjusted yet.

So what can you do in this moment when everything just seems awful.

First off, if you have a plan and you intend on carrying out that plan, I very strongly suggest going to your nearest ER. If you do not feel like you can keep yourself safe, you need to be somewhere where others can keep you safe. Psych hospitals are not wonderful places, they can be scary and frustrating. but you will be around to leave the hospital and get yourself moving in a better direction.

If you are not actively planning to suicide but the thought is very loud and prominent in your head, let's start with some basics. When‚Äôs the last time you had food or water? Actual food; something with vegetables, grains, and protein. If you can‚Äôt remember or it‚Äôs been more than 4 to 5 hours, eat something and drink some water. Your brain cannot work if it does not have fuel.

Next, are you supposed to be sleeping right now? If the answer is yes go to bed. Turn on some soothing music or ambient sounds so that you can focus on the noise and the sounds rather than ruminating about how bad you feel.

If you can‚Äôt sleep, try progressive muscle relaxation or some breathing exercises. Have your brain focus on a scene that you find relaxing such as sitting on a beach and watching the waves rolling in or sitting by a brook and listening to the water. Go through each of your five senses and visualize as well as imagine what your senses would be feeling if you were in that space.

If you‚Äôre hydrated, fed, and properly rested, ask yourself these questions when is the last time you talked to an actual human being? And I do mean talking as in heard their actual voice. Phone calls count for this one. If it‚Äôs been a while. Call someone. It doesn‚Äôt matter who, just talk to an actual human being.

Go outside. Get in nature. This actually has research behind it. There is a bacteria or chemical in soil that also happens to be in the air that has mood boosting properties. There are literally countries where doctors will prescribe going for a walk in the woods to their patients.

When is the last time you did something creative? If depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder have gotten in the way of doing creative things that you love, pull out that sketchbook or that camera and just start doing things.

When‚Äôs the last time you did something kind for another human being? This may just be me as a social worker, but doing things for others, helps me feel better. So figure out a place you can volunteer and go do it.

When is the last time that you did something pleasurable just for pleasure's sake? Read a book take a bath. You will have to force yourself to do something but that‚Äôs OK.

You have worth and you can get through this. Like I said I have had two attempts and now I am a licensed social worker. Things do get better, you just have to get through the dark stuff first.

You will be ok and you can make it through this.

We are all rooting for you.",59,2021-10-09 22:33:00-04:00,"Also, forgot to add. This is a listing of crisis and warmlines around the world. Warmlines are numbers to call to just speak to someone when you need a listening ear.

Glad this sub isnt entirely down the shit hole. ### I can't tell you how much I needed to read this today. Thank you, I hope all of you are treating yourselves kindly. You deserve to heal üíú ### I‚Äôm not feeling like I‚Äôm at my darkest at the moment, but all of this advice still really applies to me. Haven‚Äôt done any of these things in ages, and I definitely should! ### I remember last year at university, I was stuck out-of-state for school without other people for two months (for work). I would go 3 or 4 days without seeing another human being, only to be interrupted with a couple hours of human interaction. I only slept every other night, and ate every other day. My OCD was flaring up, and I didn‚Äôt feel like there was a way out. It got better though. I left the school, and I‚Äôm home, surrounded by others, with a job that allows me to take care of myself.
Even if it doesn‚Äôt feel like it gets better, it does. Because I was in a dark, dark place then. But your situation never defines you. Don‚Äôt let your situation dictate your self-worth. ### But what if we've done something insanely terrible and are suicidal as a result? Like, Real Event OCD. ### I‚Äôve been extremely suicidal from my ocd intrusive thoughts and this post means a lot to me‚ù§Ô∏è 
I‚Äôm doing better now, some days it comes, but I don‚Äôt ever wish I was dead now. ### [deleted] ### [deleted] ### Thank you for what you do. ### Thank you for this.. this helps, in a way.

I am glad that I decided to sign up for Reddit today, join this community, and read this pinned thread.

I am not suicidal, I am still eating and all, but it's almost noon here and I totally do not feel like leaving my bed and doing anything.

I feel so tired of thinking about the hand washing and other compulsions that I will perform today though I'm still on my bed.

Here's hoping that it'll be an okay day.

Hang in there, everyone. We can do this. ### This is so helpful. I was just diagnosed with ocd last week. I have those loud bloody thoughts all the time. I‚Äôm not allowed to go back to work until I receive treatment. I‚Äôm trying to find an IOP. But thank you for reminding me to treat myself like a human. ### I feel suicidal for a long time. My only life goal is ""what will happen tomorrow?"". ### If you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please do not hesitate to talk to someone.

Thank you for this post. ### Also can I please message u regarding something? Its about my bf who has OCD and I would like to know what you think of it, any sort of advice anything ### Also. Is the advice seriously eat some food and get outside lol. Boomer answer ### I know I‚Äôm late, but thanks for this post. Made me tear up. ### I always regretting getting stopped or not going through. Personal experience is weird. ### There's a part of me that wants to fall more deeply into despair so that I become desperate enough to finally go through with it. I feel miserable, but not miserable enough, apparently. I don't mind death any longer, either way. I halfway wish for something to come along and do the job for me, in the form of an accident, or something else.

I don't take pleasure in things, generally. ### thank you for this ‚ô•Ô∏èüß°üíõüíöüíôüíúüíó ### Thank you ### Did you forget to take your meds? ### This was a very helpful post, thank you ### Thank you so much for posting this. ### Man, I see this but it's so hard to actually do. The two first steps seem impossible to me. I really struggle with eating, especially to actually nourish myself. It's like food becomes inedible. I can't even swallow without choking and gagging. Sleeping is also hard. I come from a family of insomniacs, and unfortunately am no different. Any suggestions when eating and sleeping are off the table? ### Most of us aren‚Äôt trained? Most of us aren‚Äôt equipped! Bruh‚Ä¶we have OCD üòÇ<<<<I apologize for that joke. ### test ### What's a warmline? Is it the same as a hotline or? ### Yes, thank God.  Most of the posts along those lines are about feelings of hopelessness anyway, not encouraging suicide or talking about a concrete plan. ### it's unlikely that it is insanrly terrible, OCD has a way of magnifying and distorting things and making it feel like the worst thing in the world. ### All of the advice above still applies! ### If what you did weighs on your conscience, I find the first step is to confess your actions with contrition. It‚Äôs a very religious notion but it applies to everyone. You can keep it between you and your higher power, your therapist, or if necessary speak with law enforcement. If what you‚Äôve done weighs on you so heavily that you contemplate taking your life, then facing the consequences of your actions is a far better solution. Once you‚Äôve faced your actions appropriately and sought forgiveness, your OCD has a much harder time using the events as weapons against you. You literally remove the power from the events and replace it with action and positive intent.

Edit: implied in my original comment was ‚Äúin addition to getting treatment for your OCD‚Äù. The OP was suggesting that the concern went past an intrusive thought to an action that they regret so much it has led to suicidal thoughts. As someone who experienced this: I found that getting medication, therapy, and taking classes in cognitive behavioral therapy all really helped. But so did taking power away from a couple of big things that were still causing me guilt even through all of my hard work. I took the time to truly apologize and make amends if needed. I‚Äôm not suggesting to turn apologizing or guilt into another compulsion rather confronting one that exists and is based on something that can be fundamentally changed. After, real work needs to be done with ERP therapy to move forward and not be consumed with guilt over every misstep. There are many tricky things with OCD and I think this is one of them. ### If you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please do not hesitate to talk to someone.

It‚Äôs not as trivial or complicated as you may think.

As an ocd sufferer myself, I always struggled with anger and anxiety when my OCD would flare up. Over the last year, I‚Äôve found that my OCD flares up THE MOST when I have neglected self-care for a few hours. And this means a few things: 1) either I haven‚Äôt eaten or drank water in a few hours (like clockwork, even if I think it‚Äôs stupid beforehand, eating and drinking water almost IMMEDIATELY makes the anxiety connected to my OCD go down); 2) take a shower (this helps me feel clean which is a major OCD tick for me); 3) go outside and get clean air (I suffer from horrible pneumonia & asthma, and have been hospitalized at least once every year for the last 10 years of my life for it, most recently being for 2 weeks in late September-October).

While one of my ticks is NOT cleaning my hands/washing my hands when talking about my OCD, being physically full-body clean is something that, while it can be extremely difficult for me to get motivation to do when I‚Äôm depressed and/or spiraling from my OCD, it is NECESSARY to realign myself or at least see a little clearer. This can come in the form of going outside and getting fresh air for an hour or so, eating something good for my body (oily foods/fast foods tend to make me feel worse sometimes), or simply taking a shower.

SELF CARE is important. GOING OUTSIDE is important. It relaligns you sometimes and reminds you that (and this might be cliche, but it is helpful to remember): your OCD is NOT a defining part of you and that you CAN do things to gain that power back, even if it is in minuscule amounts (like taking a bath or getting fresh air).

So, yes - we ARE saying getting fresh air does help. ### Going outside provides you with vitamin d, which can regulate your mood and help to lessen symptoms of depression. ### Sorry to hear you are in so much pain.

Some years ago I had suicidal thoughts daily for about a year and a half. I was in emotional pain every day from the time I got up in the morning until the time I went to bed. I needed relief from that terrible emotional pain. 

I'm going to share something with you. I don't know why. I hope it helps in some small way. At the very least, I hope it does no harm.

My wife, girlfriend at the time, helped me some with the pain. The example I want to talk about, we went camping for ONE night on the coast of Maine. Like you, I wasn't enjoying anything in life. But, I thought, just for one night, and my wife really wanted to go. She knew it would be a stretch for me, and it was only an hour and a half car ride.

I was very anxious about going. I have contamination OCD. So I wondered what the bathroom toilets and sinks would look like. And I would be touching the ground when we set up the tent, etc., etc. Well, at least it was only for one night I told myself.

We walked down the beach in the late afternoon to an old fort that was used in the Revolution or something. Nice weather. I think we made supper over the fire. And the couple at the tent site next to ours brought a small kitten with them. We thought that was a bit strange.

But I was so anxious all the time because of my OCD that I was just walking through this trip. My mind was 50% thinking OCD thoughts and probably another 25% filled with depressive thoughts. 

But I vaguely remember my wife saying as we drove home that it was fun. So, I responded, yeah, that was fun. It was as if I was a tourist and she was my guide showing me fun for the first time or, more accurately, had reminded me of what fun was. And it kind of built upon itself. When we got home I could call a friend or two and tell what we did. Hey, our neighbors had a kitten with them. Isn't that strange? And I could also tell them that it was fun(instead of having to tell them how terribly depressed and anxious I was like the other times I called over the previous year or so). My wife let the dust settle for a few days and then asked if I would like to go camping again. I said ""yes"". And the next time we went in the Spring of the next year, we went for 2 nights. The following year we went for 3 nights.  


We have gone camping for 3-5 nights each summer since then. That started over a decade ago. Now don't get me wrong. I wasn't cured overnight. That one camping trip was just a beginning. There was also therapists, regular doctors, psychiatrists, 2 psych hospital stays, medications, AA, and hiking.

I am still in recovery. I have to keep vigilant about my health. I often experience depression, OCD, or anxiety, or some combination of the three. But I have plenty of help to get through that stuff, knock on wood.

I hope you find the relief you need and deserve very soon without having to take your life. Camping may not be the start for you. But if it is, I could recommend a couple of good campgrounds on the Maine coast.

I was told. Anyone who tells you this is easy, get the hell away from them. ### Warmlines‚Äô take an early intervention approach to alleviating struggle, while hotlines are more often used to manage crises that already exist. ### If you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please do not hesitate to talk to someone.

tmed0v,"A week without TikTok I posted here some time ago about how I felt like TikTok and its attention span shortening bullshit was making my OCD worse and a lot of you seemed to agree, I think it got over 90 upvotes and 30 comments.

I was a heavy user of TikTok and spent hours there daily. The week I spent without TikTok was the best I had had in a long time. I was more focused and acted less compulsively when my anxiety got higher. This resulted in a big relief from overall anxiety and rumination. I really think you guys should give it a try.

And yes, I downloaded it again. I was dumb enough to think that I'd only watch TikTok every now and then and not for hours at a time. 10 minutes ago I deleted it. I'll just have to do with Instagram now.

These social media giants are fucking demons as they all use the same principle of getting you addicted to fast-paced stimuli, destroying your ability to be in the moment.",15,2022-03-24 10:37:17-04:00,"Makes sense, I was the same way with Twitter. ### I'll unfortunately add to the list: Reddit.

ALL social media is made to grab and KEEP our attention for long periods of time. These are designed to provide us with ""dopamine shoots"" in our brains, which are highly addictive in general, and even worse when you suffer from a mental illness and really want to escape your reality.

Your observations are totally correct. ### I agree. I got rid of TikTok and am limiting my time on Reddit. While redirecting my anxious energy to productive hands on activities Everything feels more manageable and picking at my skin has lessened. ### Wow, good to know I'm not the only one.
Exactly this happened to me, I deleted tiktok about 2 days ago. ### I used to be on it for literally 5-7hrs daily for a solid year or two but back in January I just started to spite the app cause the content is not only repetitive but it's just trash and my videos that would get 50k+ overnight were being taken down so I jus got fed up and uninstalled it. I'm glad I did because my guilt and anxiety went down a lot too and I don't even miss the app or have urges to reinstall it either. Although a fair majority of the time I spent on there has now just been redirected to here so a soul for a soul ig really. But the user experience on here is a lot better with it being more (depending on which subs you go ofc) fulfilling, educational, worthwhile, and supportive so it's a good trade off. ### I think consuming only long form of media is good. Even youtube started doing 30s bullshit nowadays. ### Bruh I‚Äôm the same w insta and now Reddit‚Ä¶.. I use them to relieve anxiety (like now) and that‚Äôs super harmful :( but unless I delete them I have a rly hard time controlling myself ### I can totally agree. I went off of Facebook while studying for the Bar and enjoyed being off of it so much that I stayed off for nearly a year. I always found myself getting stressed out caught up in comment holes that had nothing to do with me, just reading people's stupid political and social comments. My happiness went up when I quit. Now I'm back on FB but cut out the news/political pages I follow and only follow friends and sports, and am careful to not get caught up in comment chains. It's nice to keep track with friends I don't see often and to share pictures of my family, but can definitely be addicting.

I recommend putting screen time limits (if you have an iPhone--Android probably has something similar too) on those apps to limit your daily usage. That way you can still enjoy the benefits of it without it taking too much time.

I also agree that social media and phones in general kill our attention spans. I never struggled with attention until I got my first smartphone and now I have a hard time staying focused on one thing for more than 5 minutes or doing one thing at a time like watching a movie without also being on my phone, or doing anything without listening to music or a podcast ### I deleted the Instagram app off of my phone, I wanted to keep my profile around because I do freelance work but I only upload to it from my computer and don't check it. It's been great, I was obsessively checking it too, and my screentime has drastically increased ever since. Good for you for recognizing it. ### I deleted TikTok about a year ago, although I briefly redownloaded it for about a month which reinforced the fact that it was terrible for my mental health. One of the best decisions I‚Äôve ever made, especially since I wasn‚Äôt able to use it the normal way due to my OCD (I had to watch 16 videos every time and watch them in their entirety). There is also a theme of people romanticizing their mental illness which is bizarre to me because you would think that someone with a mental illness would know that this really doesn‚Äôt help anything and can even make it worse for viewers that struggle with mental illness. ### ocd was linked to addiction, due to the compulsions. ### Also a good tip I saw if you don't want to delete apps is set your phone to greyscale so the colors designed to catch your attention don't seem as appealing. It really worked for me and it made me not want to be on my phone as much ### Gee I wonder why I see all the ADD ads on TikTok now ### I also downloaded tik tok on my iPad that I don't usually use and uninstalled it on my phone so if I wanted to watch tik tok I had to go get it and allocate some time for it, not just use it impulsively ### ",83,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tmed0v/a_week_without_tiktok/

Hang in there. ### Waiting is a difficult process, but luckily time is also powerful. Use this time to write down if you need, and communicate with yourself. When you get professional help you want to have it the best you can, I‚Äôm not telling you to expect that you‚Äôll be able to explain yourself perfectly or whatever you need to do, but you can make the steps much faster. Don‚Äôt want to turn off your brain, as easy as it is to just want to disappear until a certain time or something along those lines it‚Äôs best to not linger on that, but instead just understand that you have plenty of time to understand yourself, but also plenty of time to help you maybe understand yourself even more when you get into that session. Yes I know write down and talk to yourself is lame, but it helps organize it in some kind of way, it‚Äôs just best for the thoughts to not be only inside of your head. When you can look at them and separate them it‚Äôs much easier to understand.

I‚Äôm really scared I‚Äôm freaking out, so a website that has fan translations of mangas is blocked where I live so one of my online friends sent me a one drive link of the manga I wanted.

Now I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôm going to be investigated or something, no there‚Äôs nothing nsfw about the manga or anything bad at all, I‚Äôm just scared because one drive is supposed to be a discrete file sharing source and then I remembered there were people posting illegal shit and sharing it via mega and I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll be investigated because they think I have something bad please help.",18,2022-03-24 15:24:45-04:00,"Hello friend,
No need to worry. People get away with sending actual criminal shit like that all the time, theres no reason to get worked up over manga. I understand your fears, but everything will be okay :) ### My friend told me recently, when I confided in them about scary thoughts, he said ‚Äúyou are fantasizing about negative situations. Has it happened? No. Is there anything you can do right now about that something negative happening? No.‚Äù And it‚Äôs so true. It‚Äôs like Mark Freeman (an ocd specialist that I love) says ‚Äúwhat if? So what.‚Äù Ruminating about thoughts in your head is not only unproductive, but it‚Äôs HARMFUL. You are feeding your ocd. As much as you want reassurance, the best thing for you right now is accept your fears. It‚Äôs HARD, but it‚Äôs the only way out of this spiral. The sooner you accept your fears, the sooner you can live in a more grounded perspective. You‚Äôre not going to be satisfied by any reassurance anyone here can give you about the situation you think you *could* be in. You are not alone. Everything is okay. Take a break, drink some water, do something good for yourself- reassurance seeking is not it. ### You‚Äôre fine. People download things illegally all day everyday. ### OP I can‚Äôt convey or stress to you enough how much this is a baseless and misguided fear. My generation has been illegally downloading things for years. When I was 12 years old, I joined a Polish file sharing site using Google translate and used that up until I was 17.

Ain‚Äôt no one coming after you. ### hey it‚Äôs okay, even if they do it doesn‚Äôt contain anything bad (as u said) and I doubt they will show up at your doorstep immediately. I think they‚Äôll do a fact check or something first. anw u didn‚Äôt do anything wrong so stand by that :) ### Dude I swear noone cares. I‚Äôd be in prison by now if anyone cAred about that ### i promise it‚Äôll be okay, in fact i guarantee it. whenever i freak out about stuff like that, i remind myself that i had absolutely no bad intentions so i would have nothing to hide, and honestly law enforcement won‚Äôt take a second look unless someone *99.9% of the time that someone is already in their system for a crime and if they aren‚Äôt, they were probably reported* is intentionally and specifically downloading and distributing truly inappropriate/illegal stuff. if it‚Äôs just a manga, there won‚Äôt be a problem with them! they won‚Äôt see anything else or care if it‚Äôs just that. trust me. they‚Äôre more interested in bigger, more difficult projects than they are in all the links people download. a while ago i accidentally clicked a link when doing some true crime ‚Äúinvestigating‚Äù for myself after watching a youtube documentary. it was pretty far down in google and i think was some sort of illegal ‚Äúhub‚Äù of sorts. i panicked, clicked off and cleared my history. i lost sleep that night just waiting for the cops to knock at my door and arrest me for *literally nothing lol*. but i know they understand that technology is complicated and where we download stuff or what we click on isn‚Äôt usually malicious. people get scammed all the time, scammers get away with it. honestly i don‚Äôt think they dig too much into history unless it‚Äôs a malicious person that they‚Äôre on the hunt for. i understand this terrifying feeling but i promise it‚Äôll be okay. you had no bad intentions and therefore you have nothing to fear‚ù§Ô∏è ### What you speak of is trivial as people have stated it‚Äôs nothing to worry about, but your reaction is not trivial. These thoughts are just that a brain glitch , a thought that seems more than it is, you must learn to not give them your attention, just ignore it it will pass, it will starve without the attention, you don‚Äôt need to fight it just let it be and move on. ### No, they will not go after you. If they do, they'll also have to catch everyone else too who're actually doing illegal stuff. Also being suspicious mean nothing. Even tho literally no one is suspicious of you (trust me) let's assume someone is, they can't do anything to you because you haven't done literally anything. just try to forget that this exists and enjoy the bliss of present moment ### I‚Äôm scared they think I did and will investigate me even though I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong but just because I used one drive ### I‚Äôm not worried about what I downloaded I‚Äôm worried they‚Äôll think I‚Äôm suspicious because I used one drive (my friend shared it with me from another country) and think I‚Äôm downloading bad things (not manga or games) and investigate me and I‚Äôm trans somewhere not lgbt friendly so if I get investigated they‚Äôll know and I‚Äôll be in danger ### But they won‚Äôt think it‚Äôs suspicious I‚Äôm using one drive ??? What if they think I‚Äôm downloading really illegal stuff and decide to investigate me because they saw me using one drive shared by my friend in another country??? ### I use onedrive every day for downloading things for the Sims 4. Plenty of people use onedrive to download things for their computer, links, work things, etc. There is literally no reason to investigate anyone who uses onedrive. It's just like any file sharing website. It's like investigating everyone who uses a Google search bar because people have looked up bad things before. Would be a total waste of time. ### That‚Äôs OCD. Just take some deep breaths. Everything is okay. ### No. Quite literally no one cares. ### I‚Äôm trying but it‚Äôs hard to calm down when you feel like your life is in danger, are one drive downloads suspicious ? Like is it a common site criminals use ??? I just want to feel safe I feel like I need to delete all my accounts where I‚Äôm openly trans ### I‚Äôm not gonna give you reassurance.

tna3ai,"I dunno if this is an OCD thing. music and fantasizing? Hey all,

So my primary diagnosis is OCD+GAD+Depression with some possible trauma stuff in addition to that

When I was little, I must've gotten enamored with film trailers and music videos, to the point where I started kinda thinking up my own along with whatever song I was listening to.

This is embarrassing to talk about. But. Here we go.

By the time I got to high school, I'd basically made up this 'storyline' where I was some sort of superhero preparing for some big crazy fight someday. I was very under the influence of anime. lol.

I needed an 'enemy,' so from the earliest point of establishing this kind of thing, I used a 'dark' version of myself as the enemy to fight in these mental videos.

It's hilarious to look back at it now because I am now very much dealing with that exact thing - the OCD acts like an evil being in my brain, fucking with me at every waking moment. Sometimes I wonder if I *caused* this all to happen by accident somehow (maybe I got so into this fake story that I accidentally started believing it), or if I just picked up on my OCD from a very early age, and this is how I dealt with it at the time...

After high school, when I became practically fanatically religious, I started stamping out the 'superhero' thing immediately, thinking it was evil. When the first and most intense years passed by, I got back into the whole thing again, but with less of an 'I have actual superpowers' thing and more of an 'what I'm imagining is a metaphor' thing.

That's kinda where it is now. I know I'm making all that shit up, I know that no matter how hard I fight in these 'mental music videos' I still can't actually harm the disorder, I know that life is not a movie, but... I still do this. A lot. Most times I listen to music.

I kinda don't like it. At all. I'm embarrassed by it. I'm tired of imagining myself as some sort of superhero fighting bad guys, as a metaphor for how hard I'm fighting my disorder in my real life.

I don't want to imagine this shit anymore. I don't want to view my life as a movie or a story of any kind. I want to be more grounded in reality. I'm tired of mentally viewing myself in the third person.

To be totally honest, I'm thinking of just not listening to music as much anymore.

I mean, some songs are chill songs that I don't do this kind of thing to. Those are probably still ok. But in general, I'm wondering if maybe I can stop this shit if I can take a break from listening to music at all.

Again, I dunno what connection this has (if any) to OCD, but I don't really know where else to talk about it and I also honestly *wouldn't be fucking surprised* if it was connected to OCD because I gotta be honest, fucking every problem I ever have in my life is connected to the OCD. Seriously. It's either the direct cause or exacerbates it.

Does... anyone have any idea what I'm talking about? Does this sound familiar to anyone?

Thank you for reading",8,2022-03-24 20:47:39-04:00,"Sounds like a common coping mechanism. You'd be surprised how many kids/teens do this ### Look up maladaptive daydreaming, more common than you think ### Did you have any friends in middle school or high school? I‚Äôm not being an asshole i have a second part of the question if you answer no ### I honestly don‚Äôt see it as a problem at all lol. I kind of tend to do the same thing where I overanalyse my behaviours and assign them to a mental illness. But not everything you do is weird, wrong or unusual. The world is just so dull and boring and certain people have made it that way. But in actuality I feel like we are made to be fun and creative, it doesn‚Äôt have to be a problem. We are all different and we never know the way other people function so ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø you‚Äôre kinda limited to the information you‚Äôve been given and what you choose to believe. 

I feel like this might be rooted in something like you trying to escape the dark/dull reality by imagining these things and having a more fun and simple way to explain things. So I don‚Äôt think actively trying to stop doing it will help, rather the opposite. In my opinion finding the root of the problem/ reason why i do something and working on it is the best way to stop certain behaviours.

It‚Äôs kinda complicated and I‚Äôm very vaguely touching on this but I hope you can understand me and if it gives you a different perspective and you find it helpful, great! ### I also have no clue if it's an OCD thing or common, but I am the exact same and I've never met anyone like me until now lol. I get so into my mental music videos that I basically ignore all external sensory inputs. It's almost like dissociating. Also for me, I can't really get into it until I'm walking or riding in a bus or driving a car (i.e., the world is moving around me), so I sometimes walk in circles in my bathroom whenever I listen to music. From what I understand it's a form of maladaptive daydreaming. I don't think it's from my OCD but it's probably comorbid or something like that. ### not as much before high school, moreso mid-to-late high school I'd say ### Did your fantasizing wane when you had real friends? ### I wonder what your thought process is, like where are you going with this, what logic r u using? ### ",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tna3ai/i_dunno_if_this_is_an_ocd_thing_music_and/
tn3g7f,"husband dealing with OCD wife We have a 3 week old newborn.

My wife is extremely intelligent and just finished law school last year . She has had a long history of OCD that has recently been exaggerated. She thinks everything is contaminated and washes her hands to the point that they are cracked and raw. She takes 10+ showers a day creating an unimaginable amount of laundry. She has had a shopping addiction for as long as I can remember. 

With that said, she is the most unorganized person I've ever met. Our room and bathroom are gross. She can never find the trash can so there are constantly trash everywhere. The laundry is stacked and it's driving me crazy. Every surface area is cluttered and disorganized. Food, baby products, and feminine hygiene products all intermingled in the same areas. 

She is completely controlling. She wont let me clean or do laundry. She says it gives her anxiety. It's very hard for me to stay calm lately. 

I've reached out to her Drs and they have advised her to seek help. She refuses. 

I love her so much and just want to help her mentally. I could see she's constantly stressed and tired. 

Since having the baby things have gotten much worse. Yes I can hold my baby and burp her and change her but I feel like I'm constantly being watched and told what I'm doing wrong. Our baby is underweight, The doctors and I have been telling her that we need to supplement with formula. Just the other day I pleaded with her to just pump no call day so we can see how much she produces. It's not nearly enough. So just yesterday we started feeding the baby formula. It's relieving knowing the baby is getting the nutrition she needs. I don't count this as a win for me but I wish this would correct her thought process that she thinks she's always right. Again, she's a lawyer so she has very strong argument skills. I don't let her convince me because I am logical. The problem is now that she won't let me wash the baby bottles. Whenever she does it it takes 3 hours of running water to wash maybe 4 bottles and her breast pump equipment. Again, her hands are cracked and dry. 

What kind of help do you recommend for her?

Do you recommend me getting help? (I feel stressed)
I'm patient but I'm not a saint. 

Should we get marriage counseling? We are constantly fighting (about her OCD and cleanliness).",21,2022-03-24 16:44:17-04:00,"This situation sounds really difficult. If she still refuses to get help, at least on your own can you research OCD? It‚Äôs hard being around people with OCD sometimes because you don‚Äôt want to enable compulsions. For instance, her saying you washing something the wrong way makes her anxious is not an excuse and in treatment, doctors would ask her to do it wrong on purpose until the anxiety goes away. 

OCD is also not an excuse to harm you or a newborn. It sounds like you definitely need support. If you try counseling, make sure your counselor understand OCD. They should NOT recommend that you just do whatever your wife wants to reduce her anxiety as that is not how OCD treatment works. ### Go to the IOCDF website. Find a therapist in your area. Talk to your wife. Let her know this is not sustainable and that your family unit needs help. Let her know that you are willing to participate as much as the therapist requests. Don't let this continue any longer without addressing the need to seek help. ### Maybe shy of an ultimatum at this point. But you have to let her know the family cannot function as is. Are her parents aware of the situation? You will likely need their support in getting her to budge. ### Try marriage counseling this sounds like postpartum for sure though ### Ask her how to do laundry her way how to clean the bottles etc maybe it will help but she needs professional help and you can't feed her ocd. Try to explain to her that she can get sick easier when her hands are cracked and the kid can't live in sterile environment because will be immunocompromised in the future. Best wishes ### This post was painful to read, post partum is so so hard. She needs to see a therapist who specializes in OCD. I would also suggest for her to join a new mom/breastfeeding support group. Stress inhibits let down and her not getting the help she needs and deserves is not going to do her supply any favors. If you have the resources to do these things as well I also would: hiring a housekeeper that comes out as often as y‚Äôall can afford, hiring a sitter so y‚Äôall can have some time to unwind and couples counseling(but I wouldn‚Äôt focus on that first. Getting her help should be paramount). She clearly feels super out of control and scared. Frame it in the context that she deserves this. It doesn‚Äôt mean she‚Äôs bad or wrong. Everyone needs help sometimes. ### Two short term suggestions: there‚Äôs great articles that specifically suggest husband feeds baby formula overnight because babies tend to sleep heavily with a full formula belly and it means mum gets to sleep a little while dad gets to bond. For the bottle cleaning, do you have the resources to get a sanitizer? That way it‚Äôs a plug and play. It‚Äôs not super necessary but it might help that specific issue. ### I assumed that that's how therapy would work. I have done research and I try to not give in to every crocodile tear. 

I know she needs ERP and possibly meds.

 Since she refuses help, it puts major doubts in our relationship. That is the last thing I want. I want my child to grow up with both of us working as a loving team. I can imagine my baby developing these fears. ### If she refuses? Do I give her an ultimatum? I don't want my baby to be taken away from me. Like I said, she's a lawyer and a professional arguer. I'm afraid she's going to leave with my baby and if there was ever a court battle I would lose. I love them both so much but I'm scared. ### It's a long story with her family. Basically her mom would love to see her split with me so her daughter could continue being her retirement plan. My family is a bunch of sarcastic asses that I can't rely on for advice. That's why I'm here. 

I basically just laid down with her right now and calmly asked if we could see a marriage counselor. She said no. I pleaded with her that I want our relationship to work for us and our daughter. She refuses. So I walked into the other room. DM me if your willing to help me talk out what I can do. I don't want to be more revealing publicly than I have to.. ### I have learned ""her way"" . For the first few days after the birth, I was on top of everything. Room was clean, laundry was done. We were eating healthy. The bottles just came in the picture this week but for the 3 times she's washed them we have gone through 8 bottle brushes. 

When she takes control, I feel like there's a lack of trust in me and how she's thinking about how dirty I am. She watches me grinding her teeth thinking about how she's going to redo everything because im inadequate. It's like having a job and you have one last chance before they fire you. ### I wish she would do any of this or let me arrange any help like you listed. ### Is there any chance she'd be more willing to try telehealth options? I was overwhelmed for a long time about finding medical professionals in my area, but the telehealth service offered by my insurance company made everything SO easy, and I found a therapist I love.

I have been in your position before (with respect to a partner's depression, not OCD) and it's VERY hard to know that medical help would make a difference but not be able to convince them. And I've been there with a very stubborn lawyer partner. I don't have any good advice on that front. It is very, very hard to get someone to try treatment when deep down they don't think there's anything that wrong, or they're afraid of the work they'll have to put in, or they just have no idea that life doesn't have to be this hard. I just know that it sucks, and I'm sorry.

Prozac and therapy have made my life immeasurably better and easier--not perfect, but no longer a grueling and miserable grind. I really hope your wife gets the help she needs.

ETA: Please get therapy for yourself. It'll give you a safe space to vent your frustration and get advice from someone who understands. ### That is why I did daycare.. well because we also worked too but I wanted my child to not have what my husband has with his fears.  I also take daughter out myself without him.   Husband is on medication for anxiety.  He doesn‚Äôt eat with us mostly and is a very picky eater. ### First of all, I'm so sorry you are going through this, it sounds like an incredibly difficult situation.  I would recommend going to see a therapist yourself just so you can have an outlet to vent some of this stuff.

If family is not an option for mediation, does she have friends that know about her OCD?

I also recommend talking to a lawyer.  I know it probably feels impossible, and that you have so much to lose, but if she's refusing the advice of her doctors to the detriment of the child, I think you have a strong case.  However, I'm not a lawyer, so don't take my advice on this, speak to one.  If you're worried about her finding out, find an out of town lawyer.  They would likely have you begin documenting things.  You don't have to decide yet whether you are serious about divorce, but getting clarity from a lawyer on what your legal options are is honestly the best plan of action you can take if she is refusing therapy.

Maybe postpartum depression is amplifying her anxiety, or maybe it is even postpartum psychosis.  But if this is the way she has always been, and her obsessions are now moving to your baby, then this is likely only the beginning of a relationship between them that will not be healthy for the baby's development.

You are 100% doing the right thing by trying to get her professional help. ### She doesn't have lack of trust it's ocd that makes her to behave this way. Do you have bottle steriliser? If yes so she doesn't need to clean bottles for so long if not maybe buy one it's good to have one not only because of her ocd. Is she aware that she suffers from ocd as admitting is the first step to fight this ? ### She is clearly really struggling. Could you arrange to see an OCD therapist, even for them to help you help her? ### I've been trying to reach out for help for myself today. It's hard to find help. The places I did get a response from told me it would be months before I can talk to anyone... 

Yes, the issue is trying to get her to reach out or let me help reach out for her. 

5 years ago I had a rare disease, medication made me extremely depressed and anxious. I had to reach out to a counselor/psychiatrist. I know what imbalance hormones do to your mind. It's no joke. I was able to find the right meds through trial and error and it helped me feel myself again. Eventually after treatment for my condition I was able to taper off all meds. Neither of us have addictive personalities towards drugs. 

I hurt for her knowing she has somewhat the same issues with hormones postpartum. I just want us to go through it together. I can be a lot more understanding and patient if I know she's trying. ### Through my wife's pregnancy, she started refusing to eat with me when I cook very nutritious and delicious meals. She trusts in and out or some type of chain restaurant over myself. We do plan on going through a private school but that's going to be another year or so out. For now, I know she won't even trust me to go anywhere with her. I'm respecting her and her mother's wishes not to take her anywhere for 40 days. I don't understand it but I guess it's something religious with their culture. I don't like it but I don't want to fight it. ### We have every accessory imaginable. She washes then  boils and then sterilizes them in the machine. The process takes hrs. When we're supposed to feed the baby evey 2-3 hrs. I'm willing to do all of this but not given the chance. ### I'm going to reach out for myself.i tried today. The problem is there is a long wait to see a Dr or therapist.  She's really fighting me on her trying anything. I really want to somehow convince her but right now I don't even want to talk to her. I'm hurt by all that's going on. ### ",7,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tn3g7f/husband_dealing_with_ocd_wife/

tm6zu3,"Link between OCD and ADHD I‚Äôve known i had OCD from a pretty young age and recently (as an adult) was diagnosed with ADHD. Now that I actually know the symptoms of ADHD, I feel like it made me more predisposed to OCD or at least certain aspects of it caused my obsessions and compulsions to get as bad as they did. They seem entirely intertwined. Does anyone feel the same way?",25,2022-03-24 08:46:31-04:00,"I read that there is a strong link between ADHD and OCD. Also, having ADHD makes it more likely that you will develop OCD. On a personal level, I was diagnosed with ADHD as a child and then diagnosed with OCD as an adult (although I‚Äôm pretty sure I had OCD as a teenager). About 10 years ago I was prescribed Adderall for ADHD and it basically almost cured my OCD. ### I think they seem intertwined because OCD and ADHD often present as comorbidities. From a logical, non-clinical standpoint, it makes sense that they would present together, and in some cases may even contribute to one another. The neural pathways that OCD creates are so strongly rooted and take up so much mental space that it makes it nearly impossible to focus on normal, day-to-day thoughts and tasks. Not being able to pull yourself away from obsessions to focus on work may be, in my opinion, misinterpreted as a separate focus disorder. I don‚Äôt know what the specific clinical criteria for diagnosing ADHD are off the top of my head, but I would guess that they are very closely linked with focus problems that arise from OCD. I will also acknowledge that even after I‚Äôve been treated for OCD and made significant progress with controlling obsessions and compulsions, I still need medication to help me focus. ### Same. I have been diagnosed with both and I could endlessly list the ways that they fed into each other but no need for me enable my OCD by obsessing over my past and contemplations of my mental health ü•≤ obsessing over my obsessive compulsive disorder god help me ### I‚Äôve had attention issues my whole life, even when my ocd wasn‚Äôt very bad.

Has that been your experience? ### Yep, I have both ADHD and OCD and I think having ADHD makes it more likely for you to have OCD (?) ### I‚Äôve noticed that a lot of the shit I do because of my OCD, my friends with ADHD also do, but for different reasons. Idk if that makes sense. It‚Äôs pretty interesting tbh. :) ### OCD and ADHD are both primarily caused by basal ganglia dysfunction. The basal ganglia is where most dopamine producing cells live and the basal ganglia controls voluntary movement. Our muscles are essentially in a constant state of ""on"" bc the nervous system itself is like that (an alive body has electrical impulses going all the time) and the basal ganglia is constantly performing an inhibitory function on all our muscles to make sure they aren't moving when they're not supposed to (the tremors caused by Parkinson's are caused by a breakdown in this system, the inhibition stops working the way that it's supposed to and muscles move when they shouldn't). When it's time for voluntary movement it happen the basal ganglia is supposed to release that inhibition with a flood of dopamine which is one of the primary excitatory neurochemical, it's essentially the ""go"" signals. In both ADHD and OCD this system breaks in both directions - not being able to start things when we want to and not being stop things when we want to. Difficulty maintaining focus, getting locked into hyper focus or compulsions, difficulty switching tasks, etc are all related to basal ganglia issues. There IS more to it than that for both disorders, it's not JUST the basal ganglia but the connection between the two of them is that both involve the basal ganglia not functioning the way it does in normative brains. ### Am overactive mind can definitely play into OCD. I wouldn‚Äôt say everyone that have ADHD has OCD though. You can link any condition to OCD and try to draw conclusions but it‚Äôs pointless. ### I had the opposite happen. Diagnosed with ADHD first, then OCD three years later. I‚Äôd say hyper focusing makes my rumination compulsions INTENSE. It‚Äôs a hard combo to have but I thinks it‚Äôs very common. ### I don‚Äôt have both (I‚Äôm OCD and autistic but no ADHD) but most of my other friends with OCD have ADHD. ### Adderall helped me too , better than SSRIS. ### I have been thinking about talking to my psychiatrist about the possibility that I have ADHD as well but I don't know how to go about asking. I'm not sure why I have so much anxiety about the process since I've already been diagnosed with OCD among other things. ### I‚Äôm a teacher with OCD, and I feel I can empathize and even relate sometimes to my students with ADHD, and even autism. I understand that overstimulation prevents me from thinking, and I know how it feels to have ‚Äústuck thinking‚Äù. It has made me a better teacher, but also a more exhausted human. ### I‚Äôve shaped symptoms of both for my entire life, but for me it‚Äôs very genetic, so I‚Äôm not sure about any links in my own experiences ### Thank you for sharing! There‚Äôs definitely a lot of us with both and I‚Äôd love to see more research on the possible link between the two. ### This is so insightful! Everything you said makes a lot of sense. ### I totally relate. A lot of my obsessiveness has to do with me clinging to the past and finding it hard to let go. I just can‚Äôt seem to accept that it‚Äôs ok for my brain to be quiet sometimes and not always analyzing üò™ we‚Äôll get there eventually! ### Yes, definitely got worse as I got older! I also excelled earlier in school but as other aspects of life came into play, I had a lot of trouble keeping up with work and paying attention in certain subjects. Once I got to middle school, teachers would say the potential was there but I was not putting in enough effort. Added stressors and responsibilities that came along with growing up did not help. ### I do, too! It just makes sense to me and I‚Äôve heard of a lot of ASD and ADHD people saying they have OCD. ### So so true ### Interesting! I suspect I‚Äôm on the spectrum as well but I‚Äôm not diagnosed (yet) ### Thank you! I appreciate that. I think that making sense of our problems makes them less scary, so I like learning everything I can about my illnesses/disorders and thinking about them critically, as a way to take the power away from them. ### I also might have ASD (doing tests and seeking diagnosis) and It's interesting how many people with ASD also have ADHD and OCD. Also happy cake day! (I hope I did that right Im new to redditüòÑ) ### I also strongly suspect I am on the spectrum. At first I thought I was crazy thinking that I could possibly have all these different disorders and conditions but understanding how they‚Äôre related has helped me make a lot of sense of my brain. 

I hope we both get the answers we‚Äôre looking for! 

Didn‚Äôt even know what cake day was until you pointed it out but thank you! ‚ò∫Ô∏è ### I super get you! At first I thought I was exagerating. But even my doctors confirmed my suspicions of ASD! Goodluck on getting the answers you're looking for aswell! Wish you the best! üòä ### ",29,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tm6zu3/link_between_ocd_and_adhd/

tnbk94,"just got diagnosed and wow lol idk why it says spoiler alert 
but ‚Äî-> ive been struggling with anxiety for majority of my life. 
today i got diagnosed with ocd and now the thought of having disorder is eating away at me lol. 
so it started with extreme intrusive thoughts: being assaulted, stabbed, incest, etc. whenever they‚Äôd come up, my whole body would feel dread. then i started checking the doors, checking my food for bugs, etc. 
then it started to become total avoidance: and anytime someone interrupted my routine (of sleeping &amp; isolating) id just come off as a total a-hole, becoming anxious.
it‚Äôs come to a point where every task i do involves mental backflips. nothing ever feels right, or solved. 
i also pick at my head &amp; face as well. which is a whole other thing. 

im writing this to vent but if you deal with any of these things, you‚Äôre not crazy or a mean person. ive convinced myself im this mean and a miserable person when i‚Äôm not. or that im faking it, which is also not true. my mind wants to stay in the repetitive loop of self pity &amp; it wants to destroy me.

tnb224,"How can I help my wife? Hello, my wife was diagnosed with OCD about a year ago. Like a lot of people, after being diagnosed, a lot of previous behaviour and experiences made more sense for her. Unfortunately, she suffers with contamination OCD as one of the manifestations and we‚Äôre in the middle of a pandemic. 
She was doing okay for quite a while after diagnosis and getting better meds but she‚Äôs hit a bit of a crisis the past few weeks. She‚Äôs seeing her doctors regularly and changing things up, but we‚Äôre also in the middle of another COVID spike in our city and life is hard. 
I don‚Äôt know how to help and she doesn‚Äôt really have the tools to tell me yet. I‚Äôm doing some stuff like driving her to work, so she feels safe, but I can‚Äôt think of how else to help. My instinct is to ‚Äútalk her down‚Äù but obviously that‚Äôs not helpful because her OCD doesn‚Äôt care about my logic. I also can‚Äôt take everything off her hands in terms of life stuff, because she finds having stuff to do helps to interrupt her ruminating - e.g. her doc has said she should go to work and plan stuff for the weekends so she‚Äôs having those patterns disrupted. 

TL;DR: How can I help my wife in crisis? What would you want/need/like a partner to do when times are tough?",8,2022-03-24 21:39:57-04:00,"I feel you bud. I'm kinda going through the same thing. Your logic is useless (at least that's the way it feels to me) I want to be there for my wife as well. I hope we both find a tool that works. Please pass on any gold advice you learn along your partner's OCD journey. ### It's really great that you want to be there for your wife and help her out, lots of people with OCD don't have a great support system or anyone who understands or respects their condition, so just being there is a great first step.

Something that has helped me a lot is just acknowledging that what I'm experiencing is OCD, and therefore isn't something to be taken seriously. This works better for those with magical thinking OCD (aka 'if I don't flip the light switch three times I'll get sick' for example) but even for contamination OCD, it can help to recognize that your behavior is because of OCD, if that makes sense.

Many OCD worries/concerns are irrational, but unfortunately it is not completely irrational to worry about getting covid (I'm assuming that's one of her concerns, as you mentioned the pandemic in your post). This isn't guaranteed to work, because as you said OCD is not logical, but it might be good to talk about vaccine efficacy and how you're doing everything correctly to reduce your chance of infection. ### Just have compassion and empathy for her. Be there for her when its hard üíô ### When we‚Äôre through this patch, we want to do therapy together where her therapist can help me learn how to help her, and also when I shouldn‚Äôt/what boundaries we should set (like reassurance seeking), so will report if that‚Äôs helpful! ### Yeah that‚Äôs a big topic in our house. It‚Äôs not even necessarily that she‚Äôs worried she would be exceptionally unwell - we‚Äôre both triple-vaxxed, in good health, with a good network to support us if we need to lockdown- it‚Äôs the ‚Äúcontamination‚Äù/unclean aspect of getting the scary thing. You‚Äôre right in that it‚Äôs in part a reasonable fear; what she‚Äôs working on is taking ‚Äúonly‚Äù reasonable precautions - wearing a mask, keeping up hygiene but not over-cleaning, testing only when needed etc. That‚Äôs a good point about acknowledging the line though; maybe I can be more vocal about what I think is reasonable versus possibly the OCD talking, so she can have an outside perspective to weigh. 
I‚Äôm very lucky - I have ADHD and my wife is exceptionally understanding and supportive even when my behaviours don‚Äôt ‚Äúmake sense‚Äù e.g. sometimes I can‚Äôt get myself to make a meal or eat even if I‚Äôm hungry, and she will just put toast in front of me and be like ‚Äúit‚Äôll be a waste, so you have to eat it now‚Äù which helps a lot lol. ### Problem for me is my wife doesn't want help nor think she needs any. She thinks all her anxieties are justified and rational. I'm going to reach out to get help for myself. I just need someone to vent to and coach me to help her. I don't necessarily need them to side with me. ### Maybe if you have time you can chime in my post I made earlier. Our situations sound similar. You can reach out to me whenever you feel super frustrated. ### I think it‚Äôs a great idea to get support for yourself! I see a therapist regularly for myself and it helps to have someone who can help me set boundaries and come up with the words to say what I need. It‚Äôs also helpful sometimes to get an outside perspective to see where the appropriate response is - for me, I get disproportionately frustrated by some things that are nothing to do with my wife, and then let other things slide when I should be setting a boundary. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôll always be working on I think! ### ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tnb224/how_can_i_help_my_wife/

If you‚Äôre feeling compulsions to wash your hands, it‚Äôs good that you aren‚Äôt. Doing compulsions makes ocd worse, so even if it feels really really stressful for a time, this will slowly help you adjust. It maybe helpful if you ask them to let you wash your hands after using the restroom though. If it makes them feel better, you could suggest letting them watch you wash your hands so they know you only do it once. This may be hard right now, but I know you can do this! ### Although it can be good to resist your compulsion to wash your hands constantly, it really isn't right or sanitary for your parents to not let you wash your hands after going to the bathroom. As another commenter suggested, perhaps explain to them that everyone needs to wash their hands sometimes and maybe they can watch you do it. It really makes no sense and is kind of messed up to stop you from EVER washing your hands. ### even after going to the bathroom i can‚Äôt wash my hands i‚Äôm panicking i feel so gross and idk what to do oh my goodness everything is so dirty- and they hid the soap from me right next to my mom so i can‚Äôt grab it. the bathroom is right next to the living room so they‚Äôll hear if i turn on the tap i‚Äôm being constantly watched oh my goodness ### my parents genuinely don‚Äôt like me for a lot of reasons that i can‚Äôt control and i hate interacting with them at all. they gave me my own pack of baby wipes to use so i don‚Äôt have a panic attack and my dad tried to get all philosophical with ‚Äòunderlying meanings‚Äô but in the end i now have my own cleaning‚Ä¶ utensils? it‚Äôs baby wipes so not the most affective but hey. ### the thing is i don‚Äôt wash my hands constantly. just after eating and after going to the bathroom, and then before I go into my room.

(and still haven't) i was very very confused.

Plz with a clear mind don't confuse yourself by reaching conclusions and experiment for yourself what you find attractive or not ### There is a common subset of OCD that has specifically to do with doubting your sexuality, so you are definitely not alone in this.

I stop trying to overcome the compulsions because they simply are replaced by anothers and I'm tired of trying.

You get used to it to a certain extent but for me personally the anxiety still hasn't left. It starts as just simple handwashing then it so quickly turns into fear of leaving your home, fear of being around others out of fear of harming people.

Best is to understand the pattern.  Its always  about the past.  So best for me is to force to be in the present. And forgive myself anytime I go back there. ### I am quite lucky as my OCD theme hasn't changed in 20 years. I have safety OCD checking. I check physical around my home. Like the door is locked, the stove is off, the water faucets are off, and things like this. 

Each morning and afternoon I am constantly in and out of the kitchen making cups of tea and pouring soda pop. So I would imagine that I would at least be in the kitchen around 15 to 20 times a day. Maybe more.

But each time I'm about to exit the kitchen I look at the water faucet nozzle and jerk (actually physically jerk )my left elbow. I imagine there is a large bell attached to my elbow and I can see it, hear it and feel it ringing. 

This bell reminds me the faucet is off when I retire to my bedroom. 

My point is that for all intent and purposes  I have kept my compulsions. 

But my compulsions and checking have become streamlined over time. So I only need a couple of split seconds to check each thing.

It is imperative I remain a checker. The point of this post is that I don't want to deal with any new compulsions/obsessions. 

I have developed a memory system to beat my Safety OCD Checking which I am now sharing publically.

tmifrv,"Harm ocd with moral themes as well So my harm ocd has taken a new form where instead of simply thoughts of hurting others, it‚Äôs accompanied by justifications like ‚Äúlike doesn‚Äôt matter, so just do it‚Äù or it‚Äôs thoughts about killing people I actually think deserve death like ‚Äúgo kill serial killers, they deserve it‚Äù and it‚Äôs an incredibly scary them because it isn‚Äôt just like before where it was simply thoughts, now it‚Äôs reasons to commit the thoughts and it‚Äôs scary the shit out of me. Could barely sleep last night and almost barfed and I‚Äôm trying my best to remind myself it‚Äôs simply ocd in the a new form but this feels so real and feels like I‚Äôll agree with my thoughts any minute and snap. Can anyone relate ?",12,2022-03-24 11:47:18-04:00,"The OCD will poke and prod until it finds something that bugs you. The justifications just happened to be what bugged you. Intent and thought are two distinctly different things. If had the intent then you wouldn't care if it was morally wrong you would believe it whole heartedly.
Speaking from experience here ### For me, it's more like I would send myself to fight in Ukraine because nothing matters at all and simply jumping off a tall building wouln't do anything. (I'm 15 btw) ### [deleted] ### I guess you already know people with OCD never actually do any of it. You have to stop reasuring yourself that you won't do anything, embrace the anxiety and not fight it. ### It's clear from your post that you don't feel this way nor want to do any of these things so hang onto that point. This seems like  anxiety/fear/ocd all rolled into one. Feel like ocd makes thought patterns and beliefs different due to desensitization, while distressing and scary these thoughts sound opposite to your true feelings ### Interesting thought. I have similar sometimes as well. How do you deal with it? ### Ngl this is incredibly triggering and making me panic I may end up doing the same. Jesus ### I know you had the best intentions with this but that isn't OCD. You probably just triggered this person more than you will ever know. Sounds like you were abused which I have sympathy for but please do not tell somebody with OCD to keep their thoughts in check. Doing that is litterally a root cause of OCD. 
Please read up on OCD because this post likely caused more harm then good. 
Thoughts do not equal intent. ### The fear actually keeps me in check if that helps you feel any better, I don‚Äôt like the feeling of losing control ever again so I‚Äôm more careful in my case. Just stay away from anything that heavily stimulates your emotions or causes you too much stress. ### Prob, I‚Äôll remove the comment. I know it‚Äôs bad but it really was the only way for me not to repeat the same mistake again, I know there are downsides to it as well like the thoughts becoming worse but it really was the only way that worked for me, the other method was hurting myself instead, I know it‚Äôs a self-destructive method but one mess up could mean serious consequences and it‚Äôs hard to go to a therapist in this state and it doesn‚Äôt help that I have a cluster b personality, so yeah‚Ä¶ ### Hey man no hate here just trying to make sure people understand. Thank you ### And I think you misunderstood me when I said keep yourself in check. I did not mean to control your thoughts, I know firsthand what it‚Äôs like. And I do know it‚Äôs counterproductive. What I meant by keeping myself in check was to not follow what the thought dictates, I don‚Äôt know if you understand what it feels like to have extreme harm ocd, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a very good idea to stab someone when your mind tells you to do so noh? It‚Äôs not the usual kind of ocd where it‚Äôs easy to just follow what your thought says. And you said mine is not OCD, care to explain why it is so? ### Mine is a combination of thoughts and urges. Thoughts I do not necessarily mean but my body tries to follow, you‚Äôre right that it‚Äôs bad to try to control it, but just ignoring it gives me migraines and an uncomfortable feeling in my body, the thoughts become more violent. Following my urges on the other leads to lashing out on myself or on every object within my vicinity, it led me to embarrassing situations in public, I never know when will be the day that I won‚Äôt be able to control myself and finally hurt someone else. So it‚Äôs really hard to choose between controlling myself and letting myself go, what would you do if it were you? ### ",10,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tmifrv/harm_ocd_with_moral_themes_as_well/
tmn37k,"Any tips for breaking a night time compulsion that has been happening for my whole life? For context: I was raised religious and went through a lot of struggles with religious OCD and my own feelings on it. I do not belong to any church and consider myself spiritual, but not a part of any organized religion.

From the time I was first introduced I have felt that if I do not pray every single evening for every single person in my life and address every thing that could possibly happen to them and ask for it not to happen - then I would wake up to it happening. I have to do this every single night and cannot even start to fall asleep before doing it. It's exhausting, it makes me start questioning my beliefs, spiral into fear of death and losing loved ones, and keeps me awake. I would love to stop this but every night I wonder well if if I don't do this, what if I wake up and it has happened and I am to blame.

I feel like that isn't true but I can only rely on my crappy memory. My therapist mentioned it in passing, a simple ""You probably have OCD."" 

That's really where it began. Months ago. I didn't think about it, we were working through my depression. I feel like I'm losing my mind now, daily. I can't get a therapist so now I'm here. I've been scrolling through symptoms for hours today and I feel like I can't tell anyone because what if I'm wrong? What if I'm just craving attention? I feel like I've been doing wrong for years. I've told myself it can't be OCD because it's everywhere and I don't have some physical proof that something's wrong with me. Are my thoughts connected into the themes I keep reading about? Is it OCD if I'm worrying about illness on top of harming others on top of being found out about ""all of it?"" I don't even know what ""all of it"" means anymore. 

I spend hours a day worrying that someone will find me out. So many people have told me I haven't done anything wrong, even the people I've hurt even slightly. Is this OCD? 

I don't even know when it started. My mind's such a mess, there's so much more that I can't make myself put into words. Confessing feels like lying. I can't even tell my closest friends what I'm feeling. Just that I'm feeling kind of blegh. It's killing me. I can't even convince myself that it's OCD.  I don't know what else it could be.

I found a doctor to call, and I'm in this limbo of not being able to call and make the appointment to try and get diagnosed/medicated. It seems like such a simple action to take, but I'm struggling to jump in and do it.

Can anyone relate to this, or does anyone have a success story that goes beyond this stage I'm in?",3,2022-03-24 16:17:28-04:00,"The sooner you reach for the help, the sooner you‚Äôll get it and be able to better navigate the OCD in your life. 

I fought OCD without knowing what it was from the time I was around seven to my late twenties. It took a few years of therapy to get it under control and understand how my brain works with OCD but it‚Äôs made such a profound difference in my life. I had the option of trying medication but went without it not because of the stigma but because I had been on other medications for anxiety and really did not feel well on them. My therapist was responsive to this and worked with me to help find ways of coping and ways to rewire my thought process. 

In hindsight, I wish I‚Äôd given medication a better chance. While I found a great deal of relief through CBT and other therapies, I may have been able to get where I am now much sooner with some assistance from pharmaceuticals üòâ

Just know that if the side effects knock you out, a good therapist will work with you to adjust your course of treatment if at all possible. Not all of them are pill pushers and the best ones see themselves as coaches and guides rather than healers. Once you take the first step, it soon gets easier to keep going. And the relief and validation of a diagnosis of any kind is so often underplayed‚Äîknowing that what you‚Äôre going through is real and has a name (no matter what the mental health condition) will help you know you‚Äôre not alone, you‚Äôre not the first, and that there are ways to get better. Take hope, friend. ### I don't have many positive experiences with medication. In saying that it may work wonders for you.

I can still remember four of the five medications I was first put on 30 years ago. Not because I have a fantastic memory but because I couldn't forget. I couldn't forget the torture it put me through. These meds were for treating Schizophrenia.

Things have improved since then in the mental health field. 

I was sectioned and legally had to go to the psych ward. And even though I hated the meds I found that when they dropped one of my pills I couldn't sleep.

Just keep in mind that my situation was barbaric and is no longer the norm. And that it was 30 years ago. ### I am going through the same phase right now, I have 2 bubble thoughts around me. Should I try to fight it myself or waste money on treatment and get nothing out of it. Where I live its just beyond the roof expensive to go do diagnosis or Treatment. And doctors won't treat you if you don't do a diagnosis first ofc. 

 Idk what to say honestly, the Meds are another story for itself. Meds for OCD are serotonin boosters, something that is not permanent and dangerous to take but may cause issues on the long term. It's the same case  if you take too many Headache pills, after the 10th pill you won't fill a difference because your body doesn't react to the effects of the pill as it used to in the first part. ### ",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tn1luy/scared_to_take_the_first_steps_to_treatment/

I was on 20mg Prozac for years for depression and it barely helped.. like I didn't feel like killing myself as often I guess.

I just never had a frame of reference of how quiet my brain could be until I was on 60mg Prozac...and now at 80mg. I'm no doctor but I'd recommend to  keep trying out medication and maxing it out until you feel better and working with your doctors until you find something that works for yourself. And if anything you can blame your doctors if you aren't feeling better. (At least that was my thought process when I went to urgent care last year. That I will leave my care to the professionals and it will be their responsibility to help me get through whatever it was going on in my head). I mean you shouldn't feel like you have to deal with this alone by yourself even if it feels that way now. I wish I knew that so so many years ago. Keep telling your doctors what's not working for you and keep trying new things. I know it's hard to be self motivated to look out for yourself..at least for me for the longest time I felt like what if they can't help me..then what? Then I'm really screwed (putting it very nicely). But don't give up on yourself. Keep looking for that doctor or therapist who will work with you to help you find the relief and the peace of mind you deserve. No one deserves this hell no matter what your ocd has you believe.

Sincerely,",3,2022-03-24 14:55:50-04:00,"The medication can help ALOT. I was good for seven whole years on trazodone and sertraline. Last year, I started having more episodes and the medication wasn‚Äôt working as well. I just got out of the psych unit this week and they also added Abilify 2mg and it has worked wonders. A fog lifted within days and I was much closer to my old self. The anxiety is also still lifting. I get very bad depersonalization from my OCD and it cleared it up quickly. I hope it can help you! ### I've found that meds can help me get out of my obsessive thoughts and be able to combat them a bit easier than without meds, and sometimes helps me be able to snap out of my compulsions a bit easier/slightly ahead of time (ex. doing a repetitive compulsion <3x and then snapping out of it instead of >7x) ### Hey there, I found with medication at least for me, because everyone one is different, I was on Steraline for about a year and it helped me with the anxiety while acting out my compulsions. For example if i touched something and needed to wash my hands a lot of the time it wasn‚Äôt something i had to do right away because i was less anxious about it. Which helped me get over intrusive thoughts about certain things. However there were still things that bothered me a lot just not as much as it did before and not as many things. The one thing with medication though is after about a year i was doing so much better that i got off them because i thought i could go without them now since i was doing better which is soemthing to avoid if you start on medication. Because within two ish months of being completely unmedicated it got just as bad as it was before i started taking them. When looking to treat it the best and most successful way of getting better is medication and therapy. Something i‚Äôve done even when i wasn‚Äôt on medication was pushing myself everyday to do things small or simple that bothered me and eventually after doing it enough times and putting up with the anxiety they didn‚Äôt really bother me anymore. Now that being said you don‚Äôt want to push yourself to hard and cause a burnout and go right back to where you were before. I would try doing something either once a day or even once every couple of days and deal with the anxiety of it a few times and everytime i did it i felt a little better each time. I totally understand not wanting to share you‚Äôre stories with ocd I am the exact same way. I hate telling anyone about my actual thoughts and i‚Äôve only actually told a couple of people. In the three years i think i‚Äôve actually told 2 or 3 people the entirety of it so don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs out of the ordinary for that. To summarize yes medication will help, it won‚Äôt make it magically go away but it helps a lot and makes it a lot more manageable. So much so i thought i could go off them i was doing so well.

tn4k39,"Mad as hell and need advice‚Ä¶ So, I‚Äôm 25 and I‚Äôve lived with my family for forever pretty much, and my ocd has been a point of contention between me and my mother for a while.

It‚Äôs been difficult trying to get her to fully understand the scope of my mental illness, she once even claimed that my ocd was just an excuse to whine and complain more often, I‚Äôm still pissed about that argument‚Ä¶
I‚Äôve been trying to help her understand my issues better, but she‚Äôs pretty determined to only see them from her pov. It‚Äôs so damn frustrating.

To get to the point of this post though, she was clearing some stuff from a closet today and was going on about how much she hated the clutter around her, so she just had to get rid of it, she says if it‚Äôs something sentimental, she‚Äôll just take a picture of it and then either put it into the trash, or the donation box. I mentioned that she should be glad she doesn‚Äôt have ocd, because if something‚Äôs sentimental to me I couldn‚Äôt even consider getting rid of it without having an anxiety attack, because I‚Äôd be *absolutely* ***convinced*** that something terrible would happen to my loved ones. She then gets agitated and says that maybe *she* have a little bit of ocd, because clutter made her so depressed, and then went on and on about how my issues aren‚Äôt the only kind of ocd that exists (I **never** claimed otherwise.).

So now I‚Äôm stuck trying to figure out how to react to this shit. I honestly don‚Äôt think she has ocd, but I‚Äôm certainly not going to take someone‚Äôs claim of mental illness lightly. I don‚Äôt want to act like I‚Äôm outright denying that she has her own struggles with mental health, I mean of course she does, hell, everyone does. I don‚Äôt want to be a bitch about her problems, 

but at the same time, 
I‚Äôm fucking pissed that she even mentioned it, after years of her treating me like my ocd wasn‚Äôt a big deal, after the countless times she made me feel like my rituals and habits and depression are nothing but an inconvenience to everyone around me.

How the hell do I outwardly react to this?!

TLDR - For years Mom treats me like my ocd is only noteworthy in the sense that it‚Äôs an inconvenience to her, but now she claims that her dislike of clutter means that she must have a smal bit of ocd too. My immediate reaction is to be mad as hell that she even suggested it, but I don‚Äôt want to be someone who downplays anyone‚Äôs any claim of mental illness. I don‚Äôt want to ever make her or anyone else feel the way she makes me feel. **What do I do, how do I react?!**",2,2022-03-24 17:02:46-04:00,"Is not reacting an option? Maybe she just wants something to talk about, or in an extremely backwards way wants to somehow relate to you (but at the same time playing the ""I have it worse"" card?). Anyways, if just like, *not* talking about this stuff with your mom would work, then try that. ### Non reaction is how I‚Äôve reacted thus far, I‚Äôm going to try and keep that going for as long as I can, I don‚Äôt think it that she‚Äôs trying to relate to me, because don‚Äôt get me wrong, I really do love her very much, and we have plenty to relate to each other about without having to dive into that  genres of conversation. I try not to talk about my mental health struggles with her unless I absolutely have to, so I‚Äôll definitely take your suggestion and attempt to keep this situation buried for as long as I can.

tmvc2d,"My psychologist thinks I‚Äôm too educated about OCD Hi everyone!

I was diagnosed with ROCD and social anxiety. 
I started therapy with a new psychologist now because I realized that I engaged so much in compulsions that I had withdrawn from the present and I don‚Äôt feel like myself before the OCD, and it really frustrates me because I feel like im not the same person and my SO is not the same person although I know we are the same. 
So when I started to tell her about what I realized (that I‚Äôve been doing so many compulsions, and I know that I shouldn‚Äôt do that and I‚Äôd like to try ERP to get better), she told me that if we‚Äôll work together, I can‚Äôt read upon OCD anymore, I can‚Äôt use this textbook phrases. And I was staggered, I told her that while I understand her whys (I can easily mistreat myself, I‚Äôm going down the rabbit hole etc), I shared with her how reading up on OCD helped me (I realized that I have it in the first place‚Ä¶ I learnt ERP a little bit that I can use on my own and I even stopped many other subtypes of OCD with this technique when it just started and now they‚Äôre gone.) She said she understands because I might not feel so alone by reading upon OCD etc but she said that I just can‚Äôt do it anymore. 
I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm overthinking it or she‚Äôs really a ‚Äúbad therapist‚Äù in a way, because she didn‚Äôt just suggest that I stop it, she said I just can‚Äôt. Also when we set goals, I said that one of my goals is handling OCD thoughts better and she said that‚Äôs not a goal, we can‚Äôt set it, those are symptoms, we can‚Äôt plan on them getting easier to handle‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm afraid that she just simply can‚Äôt treat OCD, doesn‚Äôt have the knowledge on it and she‚Äôll just worsen my situation. She uses CBT amongs others, but I wonder how it‚Äôll turn out. 
I think there‚Äôs no issue with the insightful way I would have liked to share my experience with OCD with her, because if you have OCD, you just have to use the word ‚Äúcompulsion‚Äù because that is how this illness works, I can‚Äôt describe it any other way. And I thought it would be helpful for a psychologist as well to know what I realized. 
Sorry for the long and maybe illogical text, I‚Äôd just like to have advice if you think this is a red flag or just a logical point of hers. Or if you‚Äôve experienced similar? 

Thank you",4,2022-03-24 14:50:11-04:00,"Maybe she sees you‚Äôre obsessing about OCD itself and wants to curb that. There‚Äôs a fine line that is hard to traverse. She may be trying to protect you from a completely therapized existence. I would pose these thoughts and questions to the therapist. ### Honestly, sometimes I wish I knew and read less about OCD myself. Like I'll have an intrusive thought and before I really read up on OCD I would toss it aside and do my compulsions, but now sometimes I go down deep rumination rabbit holes about ""not resisting the thought because that makes it worse"" and I worry about making it worse which keeps the thought really present in my head. OCD and trying to treat it is way too present in my head. ### Like you, I would have the same concerns. My actual concern would be that she is not educated on the topic. And if I truly thought that, then treatment would be a total waste of time. I would give it a few sessions to gauge why she holds that position. If it's bc she doesn't want you trumping her elementary knowledge of OCD, then move on. ### It depends if your researching is a compulsion or not. Maybe she thinks it is.

tmv97d,"Could I have OCD? So obviously I‚Äôm not expecting a diagnosis here, just want to see what people with OCD have to say. 

For a while now I‚Äôve been suspecting I have ocd. When I was like middle school age tho I had a phase where I thought I had a ton of mental illnesses so I accuse myself of being a hypochondriac if it‚Äôs anything besides depression/anxiety/adhd which I‚Äôm all diagnosed with. 

I have multiple fears that I think about all the time. Mainly atm it‚Äôs that I‚Äôm secretly a bad person, meaning I secretly don‚Äôt feel real emotions and I only act like I do and that I really want to abuse/k1ll others. Even though if you ask anyone who knows me they‚Äôll say I‚Äôm nice and pretty harmless. 

I also fear I‚Äôm secretly a pdf file, I have anxiety around anyone younger than 16 (I‚Äôm 19 atm), but not enough to where I‚Äôm non functional or can‚Äôt be around them. Eg I‚Äôm afraid of talking/being around my bf‚Äôs 13yo sister. I still talk to her because we‚Äôre in the house together but I would never go out of my way to talk to her, I‚Äôm scared just saying hi creeps her out. And when I see videos/pics of small children my first thought is usually they‚Äôre so cute, followed by wtf is wrong with you creep. 

I‚Äôve also been compulsively picking my skin since I was 12-13, occasionally I try to get better but it always wins over me and my arms are heavily scarred from it. It‚Äôs usually picking acne but as I‚Äôm mostly past puberty I have not much acne to pick at and I‚Äôve moved to picking hairs. I know skin picking is considered to be in the ocd spectrum but not ocd per se. 

I guess all of this doesn‚Äôt majorly interfere with my life which is why I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs important to bring it up with someone. I can tolerate being around young people, my skin picking takes hours away from my day but I guess it‚Äôs manageable. But that feeling that I‚Äôm secretly a bad person has been a plague on my mind, I feel like it‚Äôs always been there but it‚Äôs gotten way worse as of the past few months. If this isn‚Äôt ocd I still want to know what I could do to alleviate this. Thanks!!",6,2022-03-24 14:48:31-04:00,"Obviously I‚Äôm not trying to diagnose you, but from personal experience with OCD I relate to all of that except for picking my skin which I know is common with OCD, I‚Äôve just never experienced it. Those sound like pretty typical intrusive thoughts, so in my very unprofessional opinion, you probably have minor OCD. ### Definitely sounds like OCD, in what way do you experience those fears? Are they in the form of obssessive intrusive thoughts where you have to perform actions to relieve the anxiety or get rid of them? If so, then yes could definitely be OCD. Please search for professional help If you're able to ### Obviously no one here can issue a professional diagnosis but this does seem a lot like OCD to me. If you still aren't sure, it might be a good idea to look into OCD resources because it might help you anyway. Being scared of being a 'pdf file' is actually a semi common subset of OCD, so OCD resources online might be very helpful in how to deal with that. ### I feel like I don‚Äôt have any compulsive mechanisms of getting rid of thoughts except skin picking. But I do that when I have any kind of anxiety. Or sometimes if I make a post online (kind of like this one) or write someone a message I have to check it and read it over and over which I also noticed my mom does. It‚Äôs never like if I don‚Äôt check my post I‚Äôll die but it raises my anxiety. ### I believe skin-picking is also a obssessive-compulsive action (?) And the last things you mentioned are definitely OCD, I recommend searching for help If you're able to so you can find ways to break your compulsive cycles and anxiety.

I have a psychiatrist and a psychologist, as do most people with illnesses other than single, mild-to-moderate mood disorder or anxiety disorder diagnoses. OCD being outside of the categories of anxiety and mood disorders, which can normally be managed by just a psychologist/therapist/counselor in more mild clinical cases, I would say that people with OCD and/or OCD with one or more comorbidities (like myself) would benefit from a collaboration between both a psychologist and a psychiatrist.

A combination of one or more medications and one or more varieties of talk therapy is the standard for treating OCD, and having the aid of a psychiatrist - someone who specializes in psychiatric medication - will make recovery faster and remission far more likely, as psychiatrists are far more adept at treating psychological illnesses than a primary care physician.

Please note: In no way am I minimizing the struggle that people with mild-to-moderate mood or anxiety disorders go through. I‚Äôm simply stating that they are treated _differently_ than OCD and other categories of disorders like psychotic disorders, eating disorders, personality disorders, etc. and often require a combination of one or more medications and therapy, whereas mood and anxiety disorders in mild-to-moderate cases can oftentimes be treated with a single variety of talk therapy or a single medication, depending on the nature of the illness.

tl8ijf,What are your parents like? I‚Äôm just curious if others were raised in similar ways. I had to walk on eggshells around my parents and I always thought I developed ocd as a way to protect myself from that.,147,2022-03-23 15:02:12-04:00,"Same. The walking on eggshells, being shamed when I made mistakes, called ugly and stupid. ### People who are raised in abusive or dysfunctional households often report feeling the need to ""walk on eggshells"" around family members. There's also been a strong, verified correlation between childhood trauma and the development/severity of OCD. Ofcourse, like any mental illness, there's genetic predisposition involved, but growing up with childhood trauma drastically increases your chance or developing it.

In my anecdotal experience, my OCD is 100000% tied to my abusive dad. When you're a child trying to learn the way of the world and every little unexpected thing can set your dad off on a screaming rampage, you become conditioned to fear the outcome of harmless, every day actions. You see every unexpected outcome as somehow your fault. You develop a compulsive need to control your environment. ### Mine are good people, they did their best, I felt loved - and I still have a shit ton of mental health conditions ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 
They did call me ‚Äútoo sensitive‚Äù and tell me I was being silly / dramatic or say to just stop worrying/ stop crying though. & they didn‚Äôt notice how much mental anguish I was in and that I was self harming etc but I hide it and still do so I can‚Äôt blame them for that. ### I‚Äôve always felt like I‚Äôve had to protect others from me, in some ways. Like I‚Äôve always had to consider their feelings before mine and repress my own feelings if I knew what I felt would upset or annoy other people. I think living like that for my entire childhood really messed me up. ### My mom has undiagnosed untreated OCD (where I got it, I assume, mine is genetic) and probably CPTSD (her parents were abusive) and my dad has undiagnosed untreated likely bipolar disorder and is in turns scary and violent (has tried to kill me) and fun and exciting to be around. They don‚Äôt really get along with each other but tend a bit more toward passive aggression than yelling. I experienced a lot of neglect and isolation because they were very controlling but not very affectionate most of the time.

They were really very bad parents to me and my brother and traumatized us a lot, but now that I‚Äôm an adult and live across the country from them I have an okay relationship with them. Neither of them is really a bad person, they just‚Ä¶ Shouldn‚Äôt have been parents, at least not without working out their issues first. ### Me too. 
I definitely had to walk around on eggshells.
I also think, in hindsight, that one of my parents may have had OCD (perhaps exacerbated by the other parent), and this was prominent throughout my childhood through it adulthood üò¢. And the compulsions used to frustrate me a lot and make me sad that that parent couldn‚Äôt seem to be released from it. But now I understand. 
So perhaps I inherited it genetically, or through my environment. I guess I‚Äôll never truly know. ### Yep! Definitely an interesting thought, though. And I was also constantly mocked and belittled for things like breathing too loud, chewing oddly, talking or laughing a certain way, etc etc. ### Man ocd is the scar of emotional abuse and neglect. ### Lots of yelling. Lots of disfunction. Lots of them crying over spilled milk, so to speak. Never knew what would set them off, really. ### It‚Äôs my mom for me. I know she has undiagnosed OCD and she would entertain my obsessions. Like ‚Äúis dad late because he got in a car crash?‚Äù And mom would say, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a real possibility‚Äù equally as anxious as me ### Really loving and supportive parents but don't understand mental health issues at all. Both have narcissistic tendencies that come off in their treatment of me and my mental health. They turn conversations about my OCD into ""I must be a terrible parent if you ended up this way"" and ""I have so much to deal including X, Y, Z, it's hard to watch you crumble on top of that"" ### There wasn't much abuse in my family.  Neglect, yes.

I was bullied a lot throughout school, though.  Most of my 4th grade class picked on me.  It was the first year I started being absent a lot.  I had a bad depression the next year.

I've always been shy, but after my last big OCD episode I developed social phobia.  I avoid people every chance I get.  My pure-O themes often have involved worrying about how others see me and focusing on how inadequate and terrible I am, making me extremely insecure.

There's definately a connection there. ### He‚Äôs undiagnosed but I‚Äôm pretty sure my father also has OCD along with hoarding tendencies. I tend to get overwhelmed with too much stuff and so does my anxious mother so that combo has been fun lmao. ### I can relate to this but more with my Schizophrenia. When I was twelve I was badly beaten. That was the final straw that broke the camel's back. So I developed a survival mechanism in order to deal with my trauma. 

I retreated into a fantasy-like world so I didn't have to deal with reality. 

Then ten years later I heard my first auditory hallucination in the same house I was beaten.

The fantasy world I live in is I believe is similar to depersonalization. 

We are in this world but not part of it. 

That's why romantic relationships scare the Hell out of me. I have to allow someone else into my private fantasy- world. ### They are good people, my mum is overprotective since always and dad (who had severe ocd years ago) works hard, bur he has his obssesions, he repairs his car everyday, spends too much in the internet and his phone. ### I don‚Äôt think mine were bad parents but maybe emotionally distant at times. I don‚Äôt remember a lot of hugging for example since I stopped being a small child and there weren‚Äôt a lot of boundaries (meaning things like curfews, though I feel like this was probably because neither I nor my siblings really needed them). I feel like my parents sort of thought that I could parent myself in some ways and didn‚Äôt need a lot of support as the oldest child and they always talked about how mature I was for my age which I didn‚Äôt like. I don‚Äôt know if these thing have anything to do with my OCD and yeah, I had a good childhood but maybe could have used some more support at times. ### TW: CSA

For most of my childhood, my father was abusive in more than one way. He groomed me for years. He was a very loving person, but struggled with PTSD and it affected his brain and his behavior in a way that is beyond me. My mother was also very kind, but favored my sibling very explicitly and would often spend days without talking to me and refusing to show me any type of affection or attention. She would do this on and off as a sort of punishment for my bad behavior. Anything could set either of my parents off ‚Äî so yeah, definitely had to walk on eggshells all the time, and I think my OCD developed as a way to finally be in ""control"". ### Like you said, ""walking on eggshells"". I remember staring at my dad at family dinners to see if his expression changed even slightly, because if it did, then it meant I did something wrong and was going to get yelled at. The earliest memory I have of him, is him chasing me down, and well, that should suffice. I believe my brain just wanted to protect me, but now the anxiety that comes with doing anything at all is tiring. ### My mom always compares me to herself and invalidates all my issues as ‚Äúbeing good at multitasking‚Äù ### My mom wants to avoid conflict all the time she'll be one to either avoid any discussion or just completely ignores it my father on the other hand is always the one to shame me call me failure and degrade me , he even calls me freak for having OCD and will always be rude to me even when my therapist called him to meet him and know about him he was like no I'm all good I don't do anything wrong with him but he again goes back to his route my mom always likes to correct me even tho my father says anything wrong to me or do anything wrong to me and she's like just ignore it or try to avoid it but would never tell my dad to not say rude things to me , even tho I'm the only one out of sibling who have completed school, graduation and currently doing master's still never get respect what I should get in family meanwhile my sister who have failed 3 times going to medical school is her dearest. My father have played major role in my depression and OCD, I guess now I'm habitual of it I know he'll be never be there for me even in my hardest time , I envy people who have good relationship with their father also I've tried to commit suicide so that I won't be able to be with him anymore. ### Very protective and ofcourse very jusmental (i beleieve that they wanted my best and they are not educated about how to raise a child like nowdays) ### Trigger Warning: Physical, Sexual, and Verbal Abuse

My mother likely has OCD, in some combination with other mental health issues that led to severe paranoia and delusional thinking. She taught me that it was unsafe to touch everyday objects, that regular substances were filled with dangerous chemicals, that smells could destroy my lungs, that I had to be constantly morally vigilant or I would become a psychopath, etc. She would rage at me if I didn't take these ideas seriously. Meanwhile, my father was physically and verbally abusive and may or may not have assaulted me when I was a child. This made all of my mother's claims about the world being super dangerous and full of psychopaths seem reasonable to me. It was a very bad combination that really messed with my ideas about what is reality. ### My father had issues with explosive rage. There were some things we knew would set him off, but others were completely unpredictable. Innocent and routine behavior could suddenly set him off. Walking on eggshells was a way of life. 

So, even in the happiest moments, there was a background fear of everything changing in an instant. His rage often led to physical violence toward some members of my family, including our dog, whose yelps I can still hear in my mind. 

The constant fear for my mother or my dog would lead me to want to fix things in those moments, but I couldn't. I was little and far too afraid to try. Instead, I would sit in my room, listening to it all, desperate for a way to get through the moments. I started trying to distract myself with ritual behavior that would cause me pain. In some way, it seemed like my self-inflicted pain would drown out the shouting and pain of others. 

I've long felt that was the birth of my OCD. ### My mom is to herself a lot. We never have any deep conversations about life or our family. I really think that my mom believed she was the only weird odd one with lots of anxiety in our family. So I think she just assumed I was gonna grow up fine. Lol nope I internalize so much shit just like she does. Instead of talking with me she would buy me tons of self help books because that's how she coped and didn't know any better.

My father is loud and arrogant and a bit narcissistic. I think both my parents are narcissists actually. Like they could never do any wrong. And whatever I did was always wrong in their eyes.

I definitely feel a lot better on medication and with lots of therapy..and now I sort of feel sorry for them because they just never knew any better. I guess this is the healing part for me where I  accept them as the shitty parents that they were but also appreciating them for who they are and how they raised me because it wasn't all so bad. They just weren't equipped to help me just as their parents weren't equipped either. ü§∑üèª 

I do feel like I still have to walk on eggshells around my mom though but it's getting better. ### I was raised well, but my mother does have some ocd traits that i think brushed off on me and contributed to my diagnosis. She is a suspicious person and has illogical fears. When i was younger she would take off my necklaces and headphones when i slept to prevent me from ""choking in my sleep"". Constant checking the locks on the doors, windows (not obsessively but you can tell she was worried about intruders). Even now that im older she'll give me heck if i leave the door unlocked while we're in the house. I can't even leave the house for 5 minutes to take a quick run to the store down the street. Doors need to he locked 24/7. It's very annoying. She has this irrational fear that someone will come in the house and do something to my little sister despite us being here in the house. And the chances of that happening are so extremely low. She has trust issues. Sh'ell check the oven to see if its turned off.  She even unplugs certain things before going to bed cuz she thinks the appliances or lamp will randomly catch fire. Just things like that. My ocd is very much avout my health. Not contamination, but fear of chronic terminal illnesses. A little bit of religious ocd as well. ### My parents got a divorce when I was 6. 

My mom was pretty unstable afterwards and fall in deep depression. I always had to comfort her and tell her that it‚Äôs gonna be ok. I had to raise myself and make sure I ‚Äúsurvive‚Äú. With 10-11 I bought the groceries, I cooked for myself and did my own laundry. I even had to budget - since my mom isn‚Äôt good with money. We had times without power, ‚Äòcuz she spend the money on other stuff and couldn‚Äôt pay the bills anymore. We lived in filth and I had wholes in my clothes. 

Occasionally, my dad picked me up and I spent a weekend at his place with his disgusting girlfriend, but their apartment was even filthier. He and his girlfriend are both alcoholics - fun times‚Ä¶ My dad was not violent - luckily, but he‚Äôd lie. A lot. His girlfriend on the other hand, was pretty manipulative and did some effed up stuff.

So, I always tried to minimize conflicts and didn‚Äôt want to argue with both. ### My mom wants to avoid conflict all the time she'll be one to either avoid any discussion or just completely ignores it my father on the other hand is always the one to shame me call me failure and degrade me , he even calls me freak for having OCD and will always be rude to me even when my therapist called him to meet him and know about him he was like no I'm all good I don't do anything wrong with him but he again goes back to his route my mom always likes to correct me even tho my father says anything wrong to me or do anything wrong to me and she's like just ignore it or try to avoid it but would never tell my dad to not say rude things to me , even tho I'm the only one out of sibling who have completed school, graduation and currently doing master's still never get respect what I should get in family meanwhile my sister who have failed 3 times going to medical school is her dearest. My father have played major role in my depression and OCD, I guess now I'm habitual of it I know he'll be never be there for me even in my hardest time , I envy people who have good relationship with their father also I've tried to commit suicide so that I won't be able to be with him anymore. ### My parents were divorced. My mom has ocd, and my brother had it bad since he was a toddler so I know mine developed genetically. But I did have to deal with their ocd, my mom‚Äôs anxiety was so bad she had panic attacks and (rarely) anger issues, so yeah we walked on eggshells sometimes too. ### I also had to walk on eggshells.  Had to be literally silent a lot. I could never make a mistake or do bad in school or there would be consequences. I never thought about how that is potentially connected to my ocd ### Mine were/are great‚Äî never felt like I was walking on eggshells or anything. I will say, my mom is an elementary school teacher and for the first 16ish years of my life I was expected to essentially behave perfectly around her friends and coworkers so it didn‚Äôt reflect poorly on her. Any mistakes I made felt 10x worse because I was afraid they would reflect poorly on her. I love my mom and she‚Äôs come around on this a lot, but that kind of pressure as a kid may have contributed to me developing OCD. ### They are very kind, understanding and- I would say- rather intelligent. I'm really happy and grateful that my parents are who they are and really aspire to be like them when I grow up :P Though yeah, none of them have OCD so they sometimes have a hard time understanding some of my OCD attacks or behaviors. But I don't blame them because I know they try their best to still help me and be there for me. Of course they aren't perfect, but they are good people who try their best. ### My dad's a narcissist. ### Good question. Lol. My parents, I'd say, are cool but they are borderline neurotic lol. Immigrant parents to the US. Just youtube immigrant parents and youll find a bunch of comedy on it lol. From different parts of the world too. 

OCD is genetic. So, If I have OCD, I'm sure my parents have some traits. And I have noticed them. Although, the only difference is. Is that they can function with them and I couldn't. ### Good parents, but one has ADHD (trains of thought are unpredictable and never thinking about how words get interpreted by other people) and the other has OCD and GAD. ### Yes, eggshells around Dad who would pounce and ridicule me when I made a mistake. Mom was obsessive about cleaning, orderliness and neatness. House was always clean. I have contamination OCD with thoughts of accidentally making a mistake and harming others. Go figure. ### I was shamed or made fun of if I lost or forgot stuff... even stuff kids normally tend to lose, like mittens. I also wasn't allowed to express sadness or anger or would be called ""a difficult child"" (spoiler: I was a super easy child, no problems, straight A student... but I was still made to feel like a burden). They're nice people, especially my mom, she's such a lovely mom. But they aren't the best equipped emotion-wise. They did their best... with what they didn't even have. They also both have diagnosed/undiagnosed mental health issues, so the apple doesn't fall far from the tree I guess! ### Yep. I know my mom loves me but she‚Äôs exhausting. She‚Äôs basically watching my every step. Whenever I‚Äôm doing something in my house, she asks me 1000 questions. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing? Why are you doing that in that way.. bla bla‚Äù. She‚Äôs constantly watching me and judging my every move. When I go out she makes sure to call me 100 times. She wants to know who I‚Äôm with and what are we doing. It‚Äôs pretty exhausting. Constantly walking on eggshells and lying to her, because she has some stupid ideas in her mind on who I should be and how I should behave, rather then just letting me be my own person. ### My mother also has OCD.  I likely inherited it from her.

So when I started showing symptoms around when I started going through puberty, she immediately knew what was happening, and she's helped me get it to a more manageable level.  It's still difficult to live with, but at least I was blessed to have a parent who knew exactly what I was going through. ### Same shit ### Mine were like that, too. Very on edge, all the time. Never wanted to help, or wanted to help very little. Actually, they hated my ocd so much, they ruined my life over it. ### Definitely egg shell walking. ### Parents are extremely impoverished, dysfunctional punk rockers who abused and neglected me growing up. I have CPTSD and OCD. My dad beat me and threatened to kill me if I told CPS, and both my parents held me down and shaved my head against my will during my preteen and teen years multiple times. I lived in an RV homeless with them, them placed in foster care (interestingly where I faced additional abuse by foster parents and racism - called ""white bitch"" etc. by black girls while in a Compton foster home) ### The short answer is my ACEs score is a 6. ### Yup. Never did anything right, I was a ‚Äúhorrible daughter‚Äù, they lashed out at me constantly, removed my bedroom doors, took away my clothing and most possessions. ### My mom clearly had OCD even before I knew I did but she hasn't been officially diagnosed and is opposed to meds. That's similar to many conspiracy theories she believes which I think is largely because of her OCD. ### My parents both basically ignored me, and wanted me to be as mature and self-governing as possible so as not to intrude in their life.

From an early age I was warned about the world‚Äôs many terrors, and it was impressed upon me that it was my responsibility (and my responsibility alone) to avoid them.  

(I grew up in a middle-class Canadian suburb in the 90s.  It was actually very safe.) ### i‚Äôve had OCD symptoms since i was around 3 or 4, but i developed bpd due to severe trauma in my childhood. i have no idea why my ocd first came out, but i do think it got worse due to trauma. ### Thankfully my parents are great and I think I was truly just born with it for the most part. It got worse though after a rather traumatic experience which is how I got diagnosed. ### Can relate a lot‚Ä¶growing up I felt micro managed even into adulthood. Expectations set by my parents that I felt I could never meet. I never felt good enough in their eyes, particularly my mothers. She attempted to control every move I make and if I had let her, she would still be doing it. Some emotional abuse, low self esteem, ect. Ocd symptoms came raging on around age 12. ### My mother was an alcoholic, mean, and neglectful, I think it‚Äôs lead me to be a more anxious and I have an intense fear of abandonment. (My dad is lovely luckily) but both of their dads were abusive towards them, my grandad on my dads side is a paranoid schizophrenic and my mums dad is a drug addict so I don‚Äôt have the best genetics when it comes to mental health lol. ### i didn‚Äôt have to walk on eggshells because they weren‚Äôt there ### idk if this counts my parents had a lot on their plate when i started feeling ocd symptoms. my mom was dealing with the adoption of my little brother (we saved him from a DV household) i had to mask my symptoms because i knew it wasn't normal and because of that I never got the help I needed. My parents seemed unapproachable and busy all the time. I told my mother when I was nineteen how I hid my mental health from her and she cried. If she could go back in time she would do it all differently. She felt so bad for me.. I told her I forgive her but not to be sorry.. I'm the one who feels bad

edit: i started feeling symptoms at 11 ### I was taken from my parents around age 6. ### I‚Äôm 19 and my parents fought consistently from when I was 5 to when I was 14. After their divorce it was just two textbook narcissistic people fighting to have the upper hand over the other. In this case the upper hand was custody of their children. 

My father, he needed to prove that he is right no matter the case and is willing to blame anyone else as the reason for why he inflicts pain. 
My mother needed the validation of both her children and sexual partners. I was more a parent to her than she was to me. Usually the sexual partners validation trumped that of her childrens and often left me with the question, why aren‚Äôt I enough? 

I never really questioned where my OCD came from, maybe the fear of contamination developed because the more I let people in, the more their rot destroyed me inside out. I guess my statistics fit, 30% of ptsd diagnoses end up with concurrent OCD diagnoses but I‚Äôll never truly know. ### i only had to walk on eggshells around my dad but i think i gained some of my perfetionism and validation seeking habits from trying to please him , which is where i think my ocd came from ### I so legit got so many of my OCD and anxiety behaviours from my Mom. It‚Äôs undeniable. Part of me was raised this way. Now, she does not, in any way, have OCD. Because my behaviours are much more amplified. However, it is her cautiousness, carefulness and drawing my attention to these things that absolutely has me way too focused on them now. The difference is that she is able to function in her life, while my behaviours seriously impair my ability to do that. ### exactly the way you described. i wonder if there‚Äôs a scientific correlation that we‚Äôve just discovered. ### Narcissistic judgmental manic jerks ### Yes no emotional support ### My parents were very religious and my ocd began because I thought god could listen me. Now I hate believing in a god. ### OCD is genetic from dads side, and most of my mums side developed it to cope with the trauma of losing their mum (my Nan). 

Dad has minimal understanding of mental health in general, however is supportive and is always a good shoulder to cry on. Mum is supportive but grew up with the ‚Äúmental health means you‚Äôre a lunatic‚Äù and struggles to get past that, so much so she refuses help for her own obvious OCD. 

They had a terrible marriage which definitely worsened both mine and siblings OCD symptoms in childhood but it was clear we were both born with it, and not develop it. My brother cannot handle anything which he deems to be out of place, full on explosive temper and panic. Can be multiple times a day. 

I am mostly rumination and catastrophic thinking. Mix that with ADHD that runs in the female of my mums family, I was a handful which my mum certainly found difficult. 

It‚Äôs bittersweet. I don‚Äôt remember much of my childhood because of the sheer tension that was there for so long. I‚Äôve blocked it out. Therapy has helped me accept that it wasn‚Äôt my marriage to fix and I‚Äôve gotten over that, but whether I like to admit it or not my parents made a difficult situation harder. ### Dad - critical, harsh, punitive, very physical, nothing pleases him, unstable, polarising, judgemental, over-expecting, controlling, manipulative
Mom - overbearing, extremely nice, covering for me, enabling dad, always forgive and forget

You can only imagine how this chemistry raised me and my brother.. ### Sorry I'm late to the party. I don't like to believe my OCD is caused by external factors, because there's no proof and I don't want to feel like it's my own inability to adapt, but I definitely fit the profile here. My mother was an abusive alcoholic, but what was worse, she was inconsistent. She'd scream and throw things when she was drunk, not pick me up from school, drive me places while drunk, etc. Then she'd coddle me and shower me with affection when she was sober. My dad, interestingly enough, was a good parent ... but he has OCD too! Relatively mild though. When he was young he was obsessed with counting things, that's about it. And his mother also had OCD, very much like my own. So go figure. ### I recovered from contamination OCD and POCD over the past 2 years, after having it quite badly for 3 years. Almost fully recovered now.

My parents have always been caring, they spoiled me a bit. 
Mom is a very anxious person who needs a lot of reassurance, while dad gets angry very easily. Not a good mix. They argued a lot. My sister would try to step in and stop them, but I just turned up the volume on my headphones and tried to block it out.

Things escalated when I started washing my hands compulsively. My family tried to physically stop me from washing my hands by hiding the soap and pulling me out of the bathroom. 

Mom had to help me with EVERYTHING. She clothed me, cooked for me, washed my hair in the kitchen sink etc. I was 14-16. She couldn't work because of me. I think I exhausted her, so she said and did things that she didn't mean.

Dad hated seeing me do any kind of compulsion. He'd get angry almost every time.

My sister didn't get the attention she needed (she had her own problems). Mom and dad were busy taking care of me. This, and the almost constant arguing, stressed her out. Let's just say we didn't like eachother much back then.

I remember being so, so relieved when I was hospitalized. No more arguing, at least for a few days. I dreaded going back home.

When I was put in a long term ward, my relationships with my family improved significantly.

My dad was so proud when I showed him how much my compulsions had shrunk.

I'm in a different situation now, but it's not because of OCD so I'm not gonna talk about it here.
My parents (FINALLY) got separated this fall, but they're still friends.

When I miss my OCD (and the security, the always being busy) I try to think about the strain it put on my family. 

Okbye ### Fortunally (english is not my language) i have supportive parents that love me and take care of me... im very grateful for having them after reading a lot of posts blaming their parents for being a narcissistc dick ### my parents don't know shit actually my whole fam think me as a mad person and when i have compulsions they say again mental and they say go be social and no problems  like this will happen and they think be watching youtube causes it they don't even know how to properly be peace at their mind for example if they get intrusive thoughts or negative memories thoughts they think just thinking positive will fix it ### I have adhd and ocd and my parents were definitely abusive. I was terrified of my mother as a kid and she was kind of unhinged I guess. She was often prone to exploding at me randomly or making weird power plays. She would often threaten me that she was going to get me or hurt me while I was sleeping. I was woken up with cold water more than a few times and intense screaming really frequently. So I would stay awake all night just staring at the door, I was terrified as a kid. I‚Äôve always had ocd tendencies but I think this kind of constant vigilance definitely encouraged my ocd. ### Yeah, my parents also bullied me emotionally for a long time, which led to many mental illnesses and such, when I shared something with them, my opinion didn‚Äôt matter to them at all and such shit like that, dad called me anything even once twice in front of my friends all this shit gave me social anxiety, this year my father died and now I feel like I did something to him, I still have a bad feeling because he always told me: ""One day I'm going to die, you're going to miss me"", but still, he was the one who continued to emotionally abuse me every day ### emotional eggshells, I would change myself to please them, and they overworked me so I could be ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù ### I tend to be talked down to, but I think it's because they always expected more from me. They can be very kind, but they can also be quite harsh...so I do get worried about walking on egg shells sometimes... but my significant other was much worse tbh. ### I'm in the process of getting a diagnosis, but I think my mom was diagnosed a few years back. The difference is that she's able to manage hers while I'm currently struggling. Being the 'good/smart' one out of three kids put a lot of pressure on me to not end up being a disappointment, so I am obsessed with doing the right thing, and in my head that means taking my mom's advice extremely seriously or I feel like I'll regret it later (this recently developed into agoraphobia for me). I grew up going to different kinds of therapy, which was helpful to an extent but also just gave me the impression that outside of my academic achievements, everything else was wrong with me and needed to be 'fixed.' I have a hard time trusting myself and my thoughts in fear that I'm being too sensitive/irrational, so listening to the person I trust the most seems like the best bet. Her thoughts/fears are my thoughts/fears, which is an issue if she has OCD lol ### Overall, pretty chill.

I've never seen them fight; when they disagree on something, they talk it out calmly.

They were totally hands-off in terms of religion.  When we were teenagers, my brother started going to church.  Eventually, I started going with him, but I stopped when he moved away to university.  He's still religious, I'm not.

My dad was really good about reading us bedtime stories.  I have fond memories of him reading us the Winnetou novels.  In my pre-teen years, he got me into reading by paying me a nickel per page of each novel I read (ten cents for books in French; I grew up in western Canada and was in French immersion in school).  He's told me that he's very proud of the time that I told him he didn't have to pay me to read anymore because I liked reading so much.

They've generally been very supportive of me as I cope with OCD, even if they don't always understand what I'm going through.

My advice is:  Don't blame your parents for your OCD, even if there are plenty of things you can rightly blame them for.  It's not anybody's fault, it just sucks. ### I developed OCD after my grandma died. My father abandoned me when I was about 6, so it was her and my mom who raised me. After she died my mom tried her best but she was visibly struggling with things like money, food, temper, grief, etc. I was maybe about 10 or 11 when I was diagnosed, and my mom became frustrated because she couldn‚Äôt understand it. Immediately after I was diagnosed with trichotillomania, and my mom couldn‚Äôt understand that for the life of her and we got into several fights about it. My OCD has improved over the years but it usually gets worse whenever my mother is going through a hard time, probably because she‚Äôs very good at stressing me out without realizing it ### They‚Äôre good, my dad is still coming to terms with it but my mom is amazing, she makes all the jokes about my intrusive thoughts and butchers my ocd more than i doüòÇ ### I don‚Äôt really know how to describe them, I don‚Äôt know what I feel about them either. They‚Äôre certainly not perfect, they provided me with what everything I need and want, they could be caring as well but I also experienced abuse from them mostly from my mom. I don‚Äôt really love them, but I don‚Äôt really hate them either. I don‚Äôt really know what I feel towards them, something neutral ig? The kind of feeling where I don‚Äôt know whether I‚Äôll cry in their funeral or not. Tho I used to hate them a lot but not anymore. I developed harm ocd and other nasty stuff, also became anti-social. ### I actually absolutely adore my parents. We have a really close relationship and as an adult I can genuinely say they‚Äôre friends to me. They didn‚Äôt handle my OCD perfectly, but we‚Äôve talked extensively about it and I know that they really, truly, had no idea what to do. My dad also has OCD and is autistic and my mom has panic disorder, so in our home there was always an attitude of ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre doing something weird? Oh, you have to? Okay then.‚Äù 

They asked me to wait to seek a diagnosis and get medicated until I was 18, because they were scared of the side effects, and they always tell me they really regret asking me to do that. But I think they care a lot more than I ever did. They‚Äôre only human and even through the decisions I didn‚Äôt agree with, they never made me feel small for dealing with it. 

I think the thing that they did best was never making my mental health into a big, separate issue. My mom in particular has always made it extremely clear to me and my sister that these were real medical conditions, the same as having diabetes. I didn‚Äôt need to be afraid of it, and it didn‚Äôt mean there was something deeply wrong with my psyche. It runs in our family, and unfortunately I was just born this way. My mom comes from a minority culture that has a very high rate of genetic disorders due to historical isolation so it was almost like she was expecting this. She took it all in stride. 

I‚Äôm a mom now and I feel like there‚Äôs no way I can live up to them. They‚Äôre seriously the best and I love them so much. I know that I‚Äôm not even half as good of a parent as they are but I try really hard! They‚Äôre just wonderful people.

I guess the only thing I can say is that I didn‚Äôt realize I was being raised in a different culture than most white Americans until I was much older. My mom had a lot of cultural rules that made me stand out. She was a lot like an immigrant parent even though she was raised here in the US because she‚Äôs the first in her family to marry outside their community. But since she wasn‚Äôt actually an immigrant I didn‚Äôt fit in with the immigrant kids clique either. She‚Äôd always want me to be EXTREMELY formal to everybody at all times and it got pretty embarrassing. Our area wasn‚Äôt the most culturally diverse and I had a hard time fitting into WASPy stuff. But now I‚Äôm very proud of it. ### My mom was chronically ill when I was a kid and so I was often left taking care of my little brother and my mom when she was sick because my dad was working and couldn't be bothered. He would usually hold me responsible for things that were completely out of my control and I couldn't always predict what things would be my fault on any given day. Because my mom was so sick (and dealing with my dad's emotionally draining family) she had a short temper and got mad often, not usually directly at me but it still felt like it was my fault. My mom was never mean or cruel to me, but her moods were unpredictable and frightening. My mom is doing much better now and we're very close, but my dad and I have a strained relationship. 

I think a lot of that had a big impact on my development of OCD. At the same time, I also know I had a lot of OCD symptoms even as a much younger child before things got rough. As a young child I had delicate rituals around going to bed, what clothes I could wear, I used to mentally count all my footsteps every day for years. Things like that. 

I was also chronically ill as a child and I often wonder if my being sick contributed to my contamination OCD. I wonder a lot about the impact of growing up in a religious environment where other adults often told me the usual battery of Christianity-related things that can incline someone toward anxiety or ""magical thinking"" or whatever else. I think my OCD is also to some extent genetic - my little brother has some weird rituals and anxieties, and my mom has ADHD, and my dad's parents I think both have OCD. 

Obviously it's a mix of things, but sometimes I'd like to see a pie chart of it all lol ### Just happened today.
My brother has covid and I‚Äôm going to a clinic soon, waited 5 months. My fear and intrusive thoughts got bad.
Usually I need people to reassure me, even if it‚Äôs a lot. I do listen, I just can‚Äôt take it in that fast.
They kinda just. Don‚Äôt get it? They think ocd or general mental illness is just a way of me getting away with things. 
Every time I try to tell them it‚Äôs because of it, they don‚Äôt actually believe it. It‚Äôs hard. But oh well! Not everyone understands intrusive thoughts the same way ### Great parents. Still got OCD. ### My Dad was normally Woking or on his own and I feel like he could of spent more time with me.he is diabetic and sometimes acts drunk if his sugars are out. My mum can be nice but sometimes not and I always found it hard telling her stuff because I had no idea how she would react so I would always feel like I'm stepping on egg shells ### None of your beeswax lol ### I'm 36 now but I'm still really good at walking quietly as I literally had to walk on eggshells to keep from waking my father, otherwise I would get yelled at/spanked.  Spankings were a regular thing, it was a strict Catholic household.

Being shamed was definitely a part of it too.  Once when I didn't finish my food my father  made me get naked, get in the tub while he poured my food on my head in front of everyone.  That led to my first panic attack the next time he threatened it.  There were plenty of other times I would be made fun of in public for being scared to do things.  They still make fun of me as an adult for things like being scared to go on a ride at Six Flags when I was just a fucking toddler.  They just think shit they did like this was funny.

I have some elements of ocd, some social anxiety, but not full blown disorder according to my psychiatrist.  It sure feels like a full blown disorder though.  I suspect my sister and father have elements of OCD too. ### Yep I experienced a lot of shame as well. Ocd and shame go hand-in-hand in my opinion ### Can't forget when they compare you to every other kid who's doing better than you but still choosing to ignore you when you ask for help ### Exactly ### Very that :‚Äô) ### Thanks for sharing this. What you said makes a lot of sense. Especially the piece about fearing outcomes of everyday actions. You never know when you‚Äôre gonna do something ‚Äúwrong‚Äù cause there‚Äôs not really any logic to it ### This is my experience and it really hit home because i discussed it for the first time in therapy this week. Never knowing what would trigger an outburst meant I was constantly searching for an answer, something that would keep my Dad from shouting. Of course there was no sure fire way to prevent it as his anger was rarely rational or proportionate so my OCD got worse to cope with the stress and uncertainty. ### Oh my God, I‚Äôm so grateful you said this and so well. I stumbled upon this post just after my father ‚Äúlost it‚Äù for no reason and my anxiety immediately spiked. I warned my mother to steer clear, closed my door, and even after over 5 years of therapy my first thought was ‚Äúwhat did I do wrong?‚Äù. I‚Äôm STILL walking on eggshells and I hate it. My father is an emotionally abusive narcissist whose moods shift at the drop of a hat. I‚Äôve lived on edge my whole life and it has DEFINITELY impacted the severity of my anxiety and OCD. My therapist has, quite correctly, told me that I must move out but I‚Äôm disabled and it‚Äôs a struggle. Right now I‚Äôm trying to separate my things from my family‚Äôs and make a plan to unwind my life from theirs. If anyone has positive suggestions, I‚Äôm all ears. ### My dad was a piece of shit and my therapist thinks this is probably what initially had me doing the things that made me feel ‚Äúsafe‚Äù. Somewhat similarly my sister developed an eating disorder and at the time her therapists said generally it‚Äôs the way people try to assert control when the rest of their life is otherwise chaotic. So‚Ä¶ yeah. We just reacted to it in different ways but probably same initial cause ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è ### Tldr; I went a bit off topic in my reply below but I already wrote it out so I'm gonna share it anyway.

I have an (unfounded) theory that the people more likely to develop ocd traits after an event are already somewhere on the neurodivergent spectrum. And unpleasant and traumatic experiences force these people to develop ocd traits as coping mechanisms to escape. Like my psychologist told me my depression could bring out more autism traits as I don't see masking as a priority when I'm depressed. And your genetic composition would determine how severe and lasting the symptoms can be with or without stress or traumatic event. So there are probably way more people on the autism and OCD spectrum than current data shows except those people had a really good support network growing up and into adult life to mitigate stress and the negative effects of ocd that come from it. ### It‚Äôs hard for people who don‚Äôt have ocd to know how to respond to it. It‚Äôs a very internal experience I don‚Äôt think people realize how much pain it comes with ### >Mine are good people, they did their best, I felt loved - and I still have a shit ton of mental health conditions ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è They did call me ‚Äútoo sensitive‚Äù and tell me I was being silly / dramatic or say to just stop worrying/ stop crying though

I relate to this so much... I wasn't ""too"" sensitive, I was just a normal kids who has normal feelings!!! I'm sure you were as well. ### I'm sure your parents are probably good people, especially if you say it's true because that's your experience. But at the same time, I think there was an element of neglect and inconsideration towards your conditions which could have made it worse. If I was in your shoes, I think my hypersensitivity would have gotten worse simply from being called too sensitive/dramatic and to stop crying. I understand they could have maybe been frustrated because they seem to not have known what to do. But being told to simply stop is a bit harmful. I'm sorry if I sound blunt, you're welcome to tell me I'm wrong since I don't know your parents that well. I hope you're doing alright these days xx ### <3 
I kept my feelings inside so much. They have to come out somehow I guess ### It‚Äôs very kind of you to acknowledge that your parents probably did their best with the resources they had. I know it couldn‚Äôt have been easy for you, I hope you have had a chance to let your emotions out about your experiences as well. Loving your family and understanding that they have limitations doesn‚Äôt mean you weren‚Äôt hurt in the process, however unintentionally. It‚Äôs okay to feel however you feel about that. ### That is sad :( it‚Äôs a confusing way for a kid to grow up. I think it‚Äôs probably a mix of genetics and environment. I have extended family with ocd ### my mum has ocd. i always felt as though walking on eggshells too. I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôm going to end up like her, which would be really sad ### Omg yes it‚Äôs like you can‚Äôt do anything right even breathing and eating. I would always get yelled at or made fun of for this stuff ### I think it‚Äôs really common. Some people who replied didn‚Äôt experience that (from parents at least), but unfortunately I think ocd is probably tied to trauma. The word ‚Äúscar‚Äù really resonates with me ### <3 ### Omg yes! My mom‚Äôs house is FILLED with clutter. I have made my apartment as sparse as possible because it stresses me out so much to be around too much stuff ### So interesting how the things that help us survive when we‚Äôre little end up being the things we struggle with most as adults ### Maybe I should add that I started showing symptoms of OCD at around 10 years old and my mom took me to a psychologist at 12 so they were never dismissive of these issues luckily, though we didn‚Äôt talk about them much. ### You seem like a very forgiving person and my heart goes out to you. I‚Äôm sorry you had to go through that ### Agreed. It‚Äôs exhausting. It‚Äôs like my brain doesn‚Äôt know I‚Äôm safe now, so it won‚Äôt stop protecting me from everything, but the danger isn‚Äôt there anymore ### If you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please do not hesitate to talk to someone.

My husband is angry, violent and abusive. 

This has brought my OCD to unprecedented levels I have never experienced before. 

OBVIOUSLY though right? 

I literally have to do everything exactly perfectly at all times to not get abused. 

This is the absolute perfect environment for OCD to explode. ### Omg :( that‚Äôs so heartbreaking.

You can never be 100% off guard. ### Oh my goodness, I wrote this above:

‚ÄúI so legit got so many of my OCD and anxiety behaviours from my Mom. It‚Äôs undeniable. Part of me was raised this way. Now, she does not, in any way, have OCD. Because my behaviours are much more amplified. However, it is her cautiousness, carefulness and drawing my attention to these things that absolutely has me way too focused on them now. The difference is that she is able to function in her life, while my behaviours seriously impair my ability to do that.‚Äù ### If you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please do not hesitate to talk to someone.

Learning how it may have once been a protective factor for me helps me heal from it now. Many people in this thread have experienced a lot of trauma at the hands of their parents, some more than others and some not at all. I think it‚Äôs fair to say that ocd is likely caused by a mix of internal and external factors (epigenetics and all that).

I‚Äôm a mom now and I‚Äôm trying my hardest to not parent like they did. I still fuck up and make mistakes and look back and think I didn‚Äôt handle something as I would have liked, but I‚Äôm trying. ### Omg! That is such horrible abuse for anyone to take, but especially an innocent little kid. Makes me so sad. I hope you‚Äôre finding ways to heal from it <3 ### Wth... I am so sorry that happened to you, truly. ### I never thought of that previously but it actually makes a lot of sense ### I've speculated along the same lines myself. I've never been diagnosed as on the autism spectrum (and don't think I ever would be with the current diagnostic standards), but have noticed similar symptoms in my history. As a child I had major sensory issues, to loud sounds, strong scents, and certain fabrics/textures. I always had trouble with eye contact, and still do to some degree. I've mostly developed ways to cope with these things as I've aged, but they do seem to pop up more when I'm feeling overwhelmed/stressed ### Absolutely, I don‚Äôt think anyone can truly understand any mental health unless they‚Äôve been through it themselves. And OCD is particularly misunderstood by society as a whole. I misunderstood it myself until I was diagnosed with it - once I knew what it was I realised I‚Äôd had it since childhood. I think my parents feel bad they didn‚Äôt see the signs but I don‚Äôt blame them - after all my ‚Äúpure O‚Äù is only going on inside my head. ### I completely agree - it did make my hypersensitivity worse and I now suffer with emotional disregulation and tend to ‚Äúshut down‚Äù when I feel angry, upset or overwhelmed. I know I learnt this from childhood because internalising everything was the only way to avoid criticism for emotions that I was was taught were bad. I harboured a lot of resentment towards my parents for years. But when I had my own son I realised that parenting doesn‚Äôt come with an instruction manual and I decided to let it go. 

Plus I‚Äôm painfully aware that my own ill mental health sometimes prevents me from being the parent I desperately want to be. But because of my upbringing I am extra careful not to invalidate my son‚Äôs feelings. I will never ever tell him he is ‚Äútoo much‚Äù or ‚Äútoo sensitive‚Äù or he is wrong to feel a certain way etc. But I often ruminate over all the other parenting stuff I feel I mess up. I try my best and I just accept that my parents likely tried their best, because if I don‚Äôt accept this then the resentment will consume me xx ### Yeah! I‚Äôll never talk to them about it because like, we do not talk about things, but I‚Äôve definitely settled with it and pretty much feel whatever way I feel about it. I‚Äôve spent a lot of time talking about harm and responsibility for harm especially in the context of holding people responsible for egregious community harm without utilizing the carceral system and while still considering the person who caused the harm as a human with basic human rights, so it‚Äôs pretty easy to apply the ideas and principles there to my own life and to the people who hurt me as well. I have a really hard time considering most people who have hurt me in my life as genuinely bad people, or wanting them to genuinely suffer. Some of them I do but most of the people who hurt me just did it because they‚Äôre messy and they weren‚Äôt even thinking about me at all.

Not that anyone else has to feel that way about any harm that has been done to them - it‚Äôs basically up to the victim in that situation - but‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs just how I approach it. I mostly just hope the people who hurt me get better and learn to be happy and stable and don‚Äôt hurt anyone else and do it far away from me.

There ARE people who have harmed me who I genuinely just think are irredeemably awful people and who the world as a whole would be much better off without, but those don‚Äôt make up the majority of people who have interpersonally harmed me, however egregiously. Most of what I want people who have harmed me to do is realize they have caused harm and choose to not do it again. ### Sending hugs ü´Ç ### Hugs for you too ü´Ç ### Yep, my dad once yelled at me for coughing when I had bronchitis. ### I‚Äôm glad you were able to get professional help early on.

He barely even knows what psychology is, let alone having the compassion to understand what he was doing to me. ### Thanks I am healing and I hope the same for you and everyone else on this sub! ### I get you. It's true, in order to move on and get better we need to let go of our past. I'm proud of you for learning from your experience and being more sensitive towards your son's needs, and I'm sure it's harder than it sounds.

But the meds won't totally erase all of these thoughts altogether.

When I was first put on medication I found these thoughts hard to deal with emotionally. Thus the more distraught I felt the more meds I asked for.

The thing you got to realize is that everybody has bad and embarrassing memories and sometimes you just have to realize that as being part of the human race.

Although whether you take meds or not is totally up to you. And you should weigh up all the pros and cons. ### Yea I guess your right meds wouldn‚Äôt take the memories away but I do feel like it would help me think through them more clearly ### ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tmzxlz/intrusive_memories/
tmolmn,"Scared of new obsessions Hi, I suffer from OCD, and I am currently working on overcoming one of my fears/themes. I'm scared of OCD latching onto new fears, but now that I know how to tackle it, I believe I can handle whatever comes my way. But obviously, I still fear it a little. Recently I read about this famous child actress who died in a plane crash, and weirdly enough, before getting onto the plane she hugged and said goodbye to her friends, which she apparently never did, saying what if my plane crashes or something. And it did. Lots of people claim she predicted it, she knew, and some people said things like we should choose our words wisely because they do come true, especially if you or someone else somehow manifests it. Trust me, I'm the last person you'd expect to believe in any of these things, but reading that somehow provoked this fear in me that if I say or think negative things, they have a chance to come true, especially now as there was ""proof"". A lot of people in the comments even shared similar stories which only made it worse. I already struggle with intrusive thoughts and have a praying compulsion, and I was trying to overcome it, but now its only getting worse, because each time I say or think of something even slightly negative, I'm scared I'll manifest it unknowingly because I get reminded of this and my brain starts thinking about it even more and ""manifesting"" it, or it'll just come true because I thought of it or said it.

Its not a fully developed fear as of yet, and I'm pretty sure it can only go so far, but dealing with intrusive thoughts already is making it worse, so I'd love to get any advice anyone has on this.

tn80b4,"could it be ocd if the intrusive thoughts i have are often the same things i think about normally as well? + can someone help i've been dealing with annoying obsessive intrusive thoughts for as long as i remember. though i'm unsure if it could be ocd since i don't experience the need for compulsions (used to when i was a child -though i guess it couldn't be that bad if my parents apparently never noticed- stuff like having to repeat certain phrases to myself or else something will go wrong, having to write down certain things i saw or heard because i just felt like i have to or else i got scared)

for example. i often think about violence (it's just a subject i find incredibly intriguing) but then often also experience intrusive thoughts about these topics. like, i'm just pondering how i'd kill someone and what i'd do and stuff (not actually planning). then get these thoughts in inappropriate situations, like when going out and seeing people, (i guess that probably stems from social anxiety and envy and hatred towards 'normal' people, as i've  always been excluded and seen as weird and stuff) just gets me ""*i hate them you hate them kill them fucking do it you can do it just do it i dont want to live i dont want to see them happy anymore they deserve to be hurt*"".. etc. which then gets me ""what the fuck is wrong with me"", i get terrified i'll actually go insane and won't be able to control myself one day, and i don't want that. this then leads me to isolating myself and refusing to go outside even more

i've also been frustrated about my sexuality for a while now, i've been overthinking this for a few months, i just can't seem to let go of the subject, i'm pretty sure i'm bisexual but still i get these thoughts how i need to prove it to myself, that i'm not just faking it, etc. when i think about sex and stuff it tends to be violent to some degree as well. and then when i see someone i find attractive i get unwanted thoughts again, ""*oh isnt she so pretty what if i killed her and fucked her she doesnt deserve to be so pretty*"" and then get disgusted with myself, how can i think this way, this is why i'll be lonely forever

another examples would be not being able to stop thinking about smth disturbing i've read/seen, obsessing over characters or people and being unable to  stop thinking about them even if i want to, remembering stuff in inappropriate conversations and then it doesn't want to go away, random urges to hurt myself and others with dangerous objects around, kissing people who are standing close to me, thinking sexually about people i don't even like and then worrying if i'm actually attracted to them (and it's always the worst ones like family members or people much younger than me or dead people or just ones i don't want to see in this way at all), urges to destroy things, thoughts that make me feel like i will go insane and the only way to calm myself down is cutting, obsessing over questions such as morality and meaning of life,   
feeling the need to track/note down random things (how i'm feeling at parts of day, when was the last time i did stuff such as washed my hair or ate or cut myself or went outside or had pains in body or felt sick or took medication etc.,writing down stuff that happened that day, - because i just \*have to\*, no real logic behind it, often checking what time and day it is because otherwise i feel lost and like i'll forget,, i used to count calories of everything i ate as well but then thankfully managed to stop that as it was making my eating disorder worse) ----- but this is just sometimes in certain situations. at other times i'll be incredibly careless about everything including money or hygiene or where i put things

*dont tell anyone youre not allowed to tell anyone you cant get better if i get better i wont be my real self anymore i will be someone else i will be normal i will become just like everyone else i shouldnt do that i have to be like this forever*  
*but no it hurts too much i hate myself i dont want to do this anymore i dont want but you have to or else*   


a few months ago i started taking an antidepressant (lexapro) that otherwise isn't making me feel any better, but this kind of thoughts have gotten less severe - before that i felt like i was going to go crazy, it felt like i'm never in peace and my mind just won't shut the fuck up and i had stuff repeating in my mind over and over and over now it's mostly the first two i've mentioned, as mostly focused on violent or sexual themes

i've never really talked about this to anyone, whenever i tried to start explaining they just didn't understand, my first psychiatrist took the violent thoughts as some kind of actual threats, then a therapist i recently stopped seeing (kinda lost my temper once and started crying and screaming at her as she refused to listen and just didn't understand me at all, and since then i haven't wanted to see her again) was just like ""oh yeah these are obsessive thoughts but it's nothing too serious"" if it's nothing serious then why the fuck do i want to kill myself bc of how much my own mind is driving me insane  
and it's so hard to express myself properly to those kind of people, especially irl, online it's much easier as i can stay anonymous and have time to think what to write before posting. i'm seeing my psychiatrist soon again but it feels too terrifying to share something like that, what if i get misunderstood again

i'm basically addicted to social media and internet at this point because it's one of the only things that keep me entertained/sucked in enough to distract myself from this annoyance.

tmmw4h,"Is This OCD? In August 2021, I was prescribed Citalopram. I took 4 10mg pills over the course of 3 days and was waking up in the middle of the night with a racing heart and anxiety about nothing. Decided to just go the natural route and seek therapy.

From the end of August the middle of January, I was doing fine both mentally and physically.

One night in January, I decide to educate myself a little more on SSRI‚Äôs and the benefits they can provide someone who struggles with anxiety from time-to-time.

As I‚Äôm doing this, I come across the subreddit dedicated to PSSD. For those who don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs a symptom that can arise after SSRI discontinuation that essentially can make you impotent. Erectile dysfunction, premature ejaculation, genital numbness, shrinkage, no libido, the whole lot.

Generally, I can brush this off no problem, but for whatever reason, this one really hit home. I‚Äôm freaking out that those 4 pills I took in August, have suddenly impacted me 6 months later lol. Like wtf? It‚Äôs like, I know that isn‚Äôt how it works. I know deep down in my bones, but I cannot shake it. It‚Äôs now to the point where I‚Äôve convinced myself I have PSSD. I can‚Äôt even masturbate comfortably anyone because I‚Äôm freaking out so much. At first I thought it was just anxiety, but usually anxiety will pass once I face it. Worried I can‚Äôt get an erection? I‚Äôll give myself an erection. Done. This time it‚Äôs different though. I‚Äôll be worried I can‚Äôt get an erection, so I‚Äôll give myself an erection. Then the next night I‚ÄôLL BE WORRIED I CAN‚ÄôT GET AN ERECTION again. Like wtf is that about? Clearly not an anxiety issue. Is it OCD or do I in fact have PSSD that developed 6 months after taking 4 pills?",3,2022-03-24 12:48:09-04:00,i think it‚Äôs ocd ### A very weird mix of being a horny hypochondriac. Could it be OCD?

My mind repeats the thoughts that scare me the most over and over, I don‚Äôt know what I did to make it so angry at me but I suffer the consequences nonetheless. The compulsions aren‚Äôt working anymore, it doesn‚Äôt matter how much I do them, I never get that relief that I used to. 

This was all easier to deal with before it found out how much fear existentialism brings me, it grabbed onto that immediately, now it‚Äôs all I can think about. I haven‚Äôt been to school in 2 weeks now, the fear is debilitating, I can‚Äôt get out of my bed. 

With the repeating racing thoughts and the constant anxiety, I feel like I‚Äôm going crazy. I feel like this is something I can‚Äôt recover from, I opened a can of worms that can never be closed.

Feels like my brain is constantly trying to upset me, lately. ### Yup. It sucks and it‚Äôs super difficult to go through so I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre experiencing it but it does get better. Eventually you‚Äôll somehow snap out of it. I quickly realized that bc I couldn‚Äôt control my thoughts I had to calm my brain with medication or supplements. I decided to try supplements first since I saw a lot of ppl recommended some for anxiety/OCD. magnesium def helped me so much to bring my anxiety down and for me that was like the first step to getting better. After that I just developed a new routine to get out of the room, wake up early, eat breakfast, do something fun you usually like‚Ä¶bc being stuck in bed with your thoughts keeps you in the same thought loops. 

Try to avoid the topic completely too. I think given your state, reading anything about existentialism will just trigger you.

Thank you again, it‚Äôs really nice to know I‚Äôm not alone in this experience ### I tried sertraline but I think my doctor put me on too high of a dose to start with causing terrible side effects which made me have to stop taking it.

Everyone‚Äôs experience is different but eventually if you work on it even just slightly you‚Äôll have a breakthrough. I also felt like it was never going to end. It will fade it just takes time/patience and some work on your part. I think the first step is avoid the topic and work on establishing a new routine bc being stuck in bed does not help at all. Also talk to anyone you trust or a therapist that can help you process your thoughts. I know for me it was helpful rather than dealing with the thoughts alone bc you need someone to help you rationalize things since OCD will have you spiraling and blowing things out of proportion you def need to talk to someone to help ground you and give you a different perspective than the fear based thoughts the OCD is causing you. ### I‚Äôve had ocd a long time and some themes are definitely worse than others and I can totally relate to the ‚Äòspecial case‚Äô thing.  I‚Äôm pretty sure, though, that everyone who has ocd has thought this at some point.  That they‚Äôre the worst, the most horrible or that their theme is the most impossible to deal with.  This is what ocd does!  If our brain couldn‚Äôt make it horrible then we wouldn‚Äôt need to listen to it and do the dumb shit it tries to make us do.  Right?  Our brains are trying to show us the equivalent of a baby in a burning building.  All. The. Time.

I‚Äôm so sorry.  Hang in there, you‚Äôre not alone. ### Thank you a lot, that makes sense. I have an appointment with a therapist in a few days!

Ah, well, the answer, if you want to improve your OCD long term, is to: leave, have the frightening thoughts, do nothing to try to get rid of them (like compulsions), and just ride through the anxiety until you see her again. That would be Exposure and Response Prevention therapy. If it‚Äôs repeated correctly enough times, then the situation probably won‚Äôt pose you a problem long term. It‚Äôs uncomfortable, though, so you‚Äôd have to be willing to be more uncomfortable short-term for a long-term  gain.

Anything you do to reduce the anxiety would likely be a compulsion. And compulsions strengthen OCD over time. So, for instance, if you DID just apologize immediately because you couldn‚Äôt stand being so anxious about her getting hurt, but didn‚Äôt really want to, that could be described as a compulsion.

For day to day - Maybe it could be helpful to practice meditation? Or learn some ‚Äúgrounding‚Äù techniques? It could be worth it to examine why you are fighting with her and see if those fights are actually meaningful to you and how they start. (A little CBT I‚Äôm saying.)

Good luck! ### Thank you. I know I need to pursue ERP, and for now your suggestions on reflection and meditation should help.

tmn367,"DOG related ocd - or is it ?? I feel really pathetic for being so obsessed with this topic and constantly anxious because of it. 

I think you could compare it to a mother being scared of harming her kid or rather not being a perfect mom and raising her child ‚Äûthe wrong way‚Äú. 

So my OCD did not revolve around this topic at all at first. This one started last year in September, when we got a puppy named Elmo at 3 months old. I still go to high school and i was 17 years old and had never raised a puppy or dog before. Immediately i was overwhelmed with the amount of responsibility a new, young dog means- he‚Äôs not our first dog, our other dog had passed away but she was so young when we got her that i was not involved in raising her- and how that also means that i should influence his behavior in a good way. I had just started high school when we got him and at the same time wanted to take on a part time job and now had to walk a puppy maybe 4-5 times a day. I was stressed out of my goddamn mind. It has gotten better and elmo is way less difficult now of course, but i‚Äôm at home most of the time and also my parents are not that interested in guiding him in any particular way, it‚Äôs me who does most of the work. 

so far so good, wanting to raise a dog is not the problem. here comes the ocd part.. it feels like i‚Äôve developed some sort of obsession revolving around dog training and how people see me and my dog. i get 
- super (!!!) sensitive and insecure when somebody tells me how to handle our dog or how to do certain things relating to him (e.g. our nosy neighbor grandma) and i think about those remarks for days if not weeks on end, sometimes months.
- very distraught if i sense that anybody might dislike my dogs behavior (even minor things) or think badly of it in some way or maybe laugh at me in their head
and
- i‚Äôve cried multiple times after talking to people or my parents about our dog
- i always go back in forth in my head between feeling guilty, being super worried about him not listening in some situations and calming my anxiety and thoughts (e.g. man we just saw this dog and he was super excited again and wouldn‚Äôt keep walking but instead kept turning around - but this woman that we saw earlier loves him and said he isn‚Äôt even bad for a 9 month old dog, it should be fine..)
- i obsessively research dog training tips and advice, also a lot of things like ‚Äûmy dog drives me crazy‚Äú to make sure i‚Äôm not the only one whose dog has some issues and get noticeably anxious when what i read goes against what i feel/think
- i feel super anxious and guilty about not wanting to go to dog training school anymore (it‚Äôs like ocd is telling me i‚Äôm horrible for that)
- i seek assurance all the time from people around me, that everything is fine, that he is still young etc
- especially when he was younger i was super anxious when he tried eating something off the ground even if it was harmless, i was obsessively researching what would happen if he did indeed eat something damaging..

mind you: elmo is a male french bulldog. he is friendly and happy and loves to play and to be around people as well as dogs. he is 9 months old. from an objective perspective, he listens to me fairly well, knows a few commands, looks at me when we‚Äôre outside. He is not perfect and he does a lot of things that annoy me but i still love him. with my old dog, behavior that i disliked never bothered me to this extent; i accepted it and loved her for who she is, but with him i just can‚Äôt. There‚Äôs something inside of me that guilt trips me and tells me i‚Äôm a bad person for not investing more time and energy into raising my dog‚Ä¶

I have intrusive thoughts and delusions and its because of trauma and I have this fear that I will take my own life and I used to follow Neville Goddard teachings that your thoughts create reality. I try and convince myself it's all in my head and that my fears won't manifest even in the Neville Goddard subreddit said your ocd or intrusive thoughts won't manifest. 

 I made a mistake where I listened to a subliminal to remove dark circles and I looked in the mirror and  I started to feel suicidal and stopped listening to it. I felt like I wasn't being myself and wanted to remove this subliminal from my mind because I wasnt feeling comfortable with having a subliminal remove my dark circles even though I felt like using it because I was sick of looking at them. 

Then I started thinking about another subliminal that I used to change your hips, legs and bum because I wasn't happy with my skinny body. Then I remembered one time after listening to this audio I think my family member looked at my hips and I looked in the mirror my hips looked curvy and another family member saw them and looked upset. Then this year I wanted my old hips back and I noticed they might have got smaller because I listened to an audio and my dark circles came back. 

I couldnt sleep properly last night trying to find a subliminal to remove this and I even contacted the sub creator who told me to affirm but when I affirm I start affirming things that I dont want to manifest. I keep checking to see if my hips changed. I'm starting to think my hips are abnormal for someone who has skinny thighs and legs I honestly dont know what to do.

tn2feq,"Have I had OCD this whole time? Have I always had OCD?

Hey all, I just want your opinions on some past obsesses of mine. 

I‚Äôve been currently going through ROCD since my brain ticked over Christmas. It‚Äôs truly heartbreaking because we had such a lovely week at Christmas then once apart my brain just gave me a thought and ever since I‚Äôve not been the same. I really just want to be back to how I was and kill it off. It was really bad in January. In February I showed improvement I think, and now March it‚Äôs still there, it doesn‚Äôt make me anxious anymore which in turn scares me but I‚Äôm feeling a lot more positive most the time and no matter what my mind tells me I know I want to work through it and be happy with her and only her. 

ANYWAY, I‚Äôve posted this exact post in r/ROCD and gone into it loads over on r/relationshipanxiety, but this post isn‚Äôt about that. 

Basically what brings me some comfort is remembering similar thought cycles to this. I‚Äôve only ever had the whole ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt love (thing)‚Äù while knowing I do over things that are very important to me. Let me list a few and tell me if you think I‚Äôve always had a form of OCD. 

1. Sexuality:
This one happened 2 or 3 times when I was a teenager. I would be sat there and one moment my brain would just click with ‚ÄúWhat if you‚Äôre gay?‚Äù Or ‚ÄúAre you really attracted to girls?‚Äù And it would be all I‚Äôd think about. I didn‚Äôt want to move or see anyone or talk because I‚Äôd be deep in my mind trying to convince myself I was still straight. I knew deep down I was, but I would be testing myself (looking at pictures etc) or remembering times in my life for evidence (if I‚Äôd made a male friend, thinking it was because I was attracted). Anyway, this would last a maximum of 2/3 weeks and would one day just go. 

2. Music:
Since I was young I‚Äôve always loved The Beatles, I‚Äôd say an obsessive amount. When I first found them I would binge listen to only their music. I read about every detail and am quite literally a super fan to this day. But there were a couple occasions when one day my mind would suddenly click and act numb to the music. I‚Äôd listen to them to see if I was still getting the same kick, not have the same enthusiasm when talking about them because I was busy checking how I felt while talking about them and it really upset me because I knew I wanted to love them. This too lasted a few weeks and vanished. I can happily say their still my favourite band now lol.

3. Guitar: 
I‚Äôm a guitarist and it‚Äôs my passion and I study music so its my life really. I got a guitar for my 18th birthday, its one I really wanted and loved and it would be a special gift because it was my 18th. When I got it, I loved it and could not stop playing it and just looking at it. However one day once again my mind clicked with thoughts of ‚Äúit‚Äôs not that great‚Äù. This really upset me because I‚Äôd just gotten it months before and had loved it. I kept playing it and testing whether I was getting the same kick from it, and the only reason I wasn‚Äôt was because I was testing myself I suppose. I remember playing a gig with it and afterwards getting temporary relief thinking ‚Äúthat‚Äôs what I needed to fall in love with it again‚Äù while I still wasn‚Äôt fully convinced when I said it, I still had that temp relief. Needless to say I got over that mindset and it‚Äôs still my favourite guitar and always will be. 



There are a few other minor episodes I‚Äôve had, but thinking of these episodes now does nothing to me. I can laugh it off and think about other things. It no longer triggers me and probably never will. 

I know I‚Äôm getting this exact thing with my relationship right now. It scares me that it hasn‚Äôt gone away but the way I got rid of the other obsessions was by keeping myself busy with school or friends etc. Is it just because she‚Äôs my girlfriend, I love her and think about her all the time regardless that it‚Äôs not going away as fast? I can‚Äôt just NOT think about her! I WANT to think about her, just not with these obsessive thoughts. I know I love her beneath it all and I WANT to. I WANT to be with her. The very same way I knew this about sexuality, music, guitars etc. 

It seems when I get something in my life that I love, during the early stages of having it I‚Äôm obsessed in a good way, then a few months in my head is like ‚Äúare you sure you love it?‚Äù Then a bit afterwards that mindset vanishes. I‚Äôm still waiting for that to happen. Is it just things you love but may be insecure about? (I‚Äôve always been kind of insecure about sexuality i guess. I never had a lot of attention from girls in school nor had early girlfriends, I‚Äôve always been kind of insecure about my music taste and felt the need to prove I like good music, and as for guitar I think a lot of musicians can be insecure about skill, but this guitar was one not a lot of my friends liked but I did. As for my girlfriend, she‚Äôs absolutely beautiful and if you told secondary school, teenage me I‚Äôd end up with someone like her I would in no way believe you. I guess I never expected to end up with someone so attractive and such a catch). 

I never looked into what it might be over the past obsessions, so maybe I‚Äôm now being too aware of it, but like I said I can‚Äôt just not think about her. In moments of clarity I think about her and am happy and I like to savour and enjoy those moments, which I remember doing with the other things, but I do feel my mind searching for ways to drag me down. 

Sorry for rambling, I just want your opinions. From my past examples do you think I‚Äôve always had this? This OCD thinking? I just want it to go away because it breaks my heart but there never seems to be an easy way out. 

Thanks guys :)

tn22l3,"how to help my wife with GAD and OCD? My wife has GAD and OCD, did some talk therapy at times but no medications. We've had a lot of relationship issues including a dead bedroom happen due to the anxiety. I'm not saying she is totally at fault for the lack of intimacy, but I have observed a lot of ways in which the anxiety is suffocating the life out of our marriage. After our first child was born she had really bad PP OCD for the first year. Now she is pregnant again and I am worried about this getting worse for her, but she doesn't want to get help for it.

I have a lot of trouble talking to her about it because she tends to deflect blame onto herself or onto me in a very reactionary way without introspection. Basically she is always in that anxious state, so not able to see how it affects our whole family the way I do. And if I talk about any of the issues then it's threatening to her.

However when I give her time & space she does say things like she hates her own mind, wants to cut it out of her head and get therapy. It's tragic and I want to support her but she fights me and says its not important. She does not seek support and this has been going on for many years while I perceive her mental health to be declining. I feel like I am not just equipped with the tools to help her. I see how my own behaviors have adapted to the OCD and I am seeing the impact on my son.

tn21g6,"Never diagnosed, can I say I have it? Hey, normally stalk Reddit but made an account to ask a question.

**Obligatory backstory**

So I went to my doctor a year and told them about how I was experiencing symptoms of OCD, what could be done about it. We had just a 30 minuet apointment to discuss it and they agreed with me and started me on sertraline just like that. Went back after a month and dose increase, same the month after it seemed benificial after that so just back every three months for a check in and repeat the perscription.

I want to clarify they did tell me I should seek someone to talk to, and provided me with a website for a company they're meant to recomend to everyone as it's the cheapest and sustained by the government so promoted through them too. Still not free and all they can offer is a maximum of one 30 minuet session a week for 2 months for those suffering from 'low mood, mild anxiety, and low self esteem'. They can not diagnose things, they can not provide long term therepy, recomendations to those who could, or even promise that they will pair you with someone with the bare minimum of a psychology bachelor's. So I never bothered with them.

I'm living between two different countries (doing my master's and dont live in the same country as the uni for half the year and its a few hours between), and get my perscription in home country so can's sign up with different doctor in university country. There's no affordable therepy for me there that I could reliably get diagnosed through. The wait times are so long I wouldn't know whether I'd be there to attend the apointments when I get them and too expensive to miss.

**My question:**

Myself and my doctor are pretty confident I have OCD and made sure it was nothing physiological effecting me, and so he is willing to keep my perscription going so long as its helping. But can I tell someone I have OCD? How do I explain why I'm taking sertraline? I feel like I'm lying if I say it when it is my doctor who agrees and not a diagnoses from a psychiatrist. I'm not even sure how he's written the reason for sertraline on my medical file. So yeah, is it morally wrong and just offensive to say I have OCD?",1,2022-03-24 16:23:26-04:00,"Obviously you can. No one is stopping you. As for whether people support it, that will depend. I personally don‚Äôt care. Don‚Äôt really care about fakers either. Doesn‚Äôt feel like my business. Other people freak out about it and try to get all gate keepy with it. 

OCD is sometimes called the doubting disorder.  Sounds like this is making you doubt yourself a little bit. Rather than letting internet strangers decide for you, try to just sit with the discomfort and make whatever choices YOU feel are right. ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tn21g6/never_diagnosed_can_i_say_i_have_it/
tn1utj,"Am I just in denial or do I have Trans OCD? Right off I'm sorry for my bad English and my weird writing style.

So this is my story about me and my intrusive thoughts about being trans:

For info: I'm an bisexual 18 year old male, suffering from severe porn addiction and internalised toxic masculinity and homophobia. I hate myself, physically and mentally. 

It all began with me being obsessed with fictional scenarios and so on, I'm an generic overthinker that has to go through every thought that I have because I'm insecure as hell. When I was with my toxic (ex) GF I always had the weird feeling that she's not the one for me, until we really broke up, which led me into believing that everytime I overthink, I am actually always right with my thoughts. I also was really obsessed with me possibly having brain cancer, which also led me into believing 2 years that  I'm about to die, until i did a x-ray of my brain and nothing was there.

Now to my main problem: I'm obsessively going through the thought if I'm trans. It started with a trans woman that gave me the chance to have a threesome with her and boyfriend, since then I can't forget this person, I literally don't know why, it already happened 1 year ago. I declined the offer and since then I always think about it and it destroys me because it just feels so disgusting, I feel so uncomfy when I remember this. But nethertheless I'm constantly in a inner combat with myself, my intrusive thoughts are those hypothetical ""what if scenarios"", for example my biggest fear is like those stories you hear on the internet where a 'husband turns trans after 20 years into marriage and the wife leaves the husband with the kids'. I'm afraid that this will happen to me because of me fearing becoming trans. My compulsions are memory checking, body checking, checking if I like things that'll make me trans (?), reassuring myself that I'm a male and repressing my intrusive thoughts. I'm also hardly afraid of transitioning and destroying my body with hormones and surgeries, but regarding the story with the husband it just makes me more and more furious about the whole situation in general. 

I just want it to end already.

Also, at this moment I cannot consult a therapist because I'm being rejected from literally any therapist in my region. It's hard. I'm sorry.",3,2022-03-24 16:21:10-04:00,"You will most likely not be able to get clarity about your gender identity until you face the OCD. What helped me when I was questioning was to stop thinking about labels and start thinking about ACTIONS. some cis women go on hormones. Cis men do too. Some cis men wear dresses and go by she/her pronouns. Some cis men like to be perceived as women. Some trans women do NOT go on hormones or get surgery. Some trans women like looking like men. Trans women can be butch lesbians, they can use he/him pronouns. There‚Äôs no straight line from your identity to what that means for you. 

So instead of obsessing about a label, just ask yourself what feels good. Do you like it when people call you she/her? If not, don‚Äôt use those pronouns. What clothes do you like? Wear more clothes like that. Just take it one decision at a time. ### [deleted] ### If you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please do not hesitate to talk to someone.

What if something changed after posting something in the Internet and the change can only be reverted by deleting everything related to the post from the Internet. Other people can see and it will cause a chain reaction of irreversible actions that would be out of control and I will never be able to revert things into it's previous state. For example, say someone searched something in the internet regarding this post. It will stay in the google activity of the user for a very long time and I can do nothing about that. I like things to be in control.

I am too hyperaware of my decisions. Meditation led me to existential and philosophical OCD. Before meditation I was completely unaware of these philosophical questions but still had OCD.

I have basically a ""fear of being involved"" in life. Questions like, 'Is this enlightenment? Isn't everyone god if they have freewill? Isn't the idea of butterfly effect scary to people?' plague me. Seems like the universe is neither deterministic nor indeterministic.

Does anyone else has this fear of making decisions? Sorry if I made someone's OCD bad.

But I can't control things forever like this, especially in this age of Internet. So I am practicing letting go. ### Thank you for making this post, and facing your OCD head on! It is hard to let go, especially with this condition, so you have my full respect for that.

I also have these kind of thoughts, especially surrounding the butterfly effect and the internet, paralysing my ability to make decisions because I fear their consequences. This hyper awareness, I think, is a big part of my OCD that makes treating other parts of my OCD difficult. Rather than open up, I close myself off for fear of being called out, either for being a bad member of the community or people not relating to my experiences and becoming ‚Äòweird‚Äô, even on anonymous platforms. 

I think the best thing I did for myself is open up to my personal circle about my thought processes, so I could get their opinions and support on making decisions. I still deeply fear the butterfly effect, but openly communicating about the possibility of causing harm through the butterfly effect with my girlfriend, is how I let go. It sounds like meditation is maybe not a great route for you personally to let go of these particular thoughts. I wouldn‚Äôt know what advice to give, but I empathise with you and suffer through these thoughts as well. ### Going deep into the rabbit hole is risky. It will lead you to have more questions than answer. But you do grow intellectually. Meditation and lectures of Alan Watts drastically changed my perspective of the world. OCD teaches you no matter how you try to convince yourself that the thought has no value in reality, it'll simply not agree. The real secret to the end of suffering is to ""let go"".

Solving one problem will lead to another more difficult one. What I've learned is, in life, we have to learn to bypass somethings rather than try to solve it. Nothing is certain. Everything has an element of ""faith"" in it. But you can try to solve it if you want to. With suffering you will have many insights as well. But instead of only dreading about our condition, we have to dissect out beliefs, thoughts and behavior. Then only, something positive comes out of it.

My OCD and depression was left untreated for 2 years. But during those days I was not only just doing compulsions but also analyzing and thinking about my core fears. That's how I gained a lot of knowledge about myself and human psychology in general. I can definitely feel myself more intelligent than I was before my mental illness.

I am on medication because I feel fatigued by all this tiresome journey. Right now I just want to focus on my studies and give my brain a break. I'll do whatever to control my OCD for a while. However, when there's a right time, I can always go back and deal with all those questions and discover the dark fears and secrets of my psychology again. ### If you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please do not hesitate to talk to someone.

When you say that, does that mean whatever I've posted about myself mean I'm gay?

I'm just scared if I'm an internalized homophobe then that means I'm gay. And I don't want to be gay because that doesn't feel like who I am, I want to like guys. ### Just wanted to lyk I saw your post on the HOCD sub. I did have severe HOCD. I constantly sought out reassurance that I was straight, constant checking behaviors, intrusive thoughts all the time, and I was truly in such deep denial that I thought I was a heterosexual who couldn‚Äôt possibly be gay. I was young when I had it, but that doesn‚Äôt mean my experience isn‚Äôt valid.

It also wasn‚Äôt cool to see my own personal experience being discussed without my knowledge. Also the comments about how ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand‚Äù a mental illness that I had when I was just trying to help you. I even told you my experience doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre gay. You have more than one account that you use to ask for reassurance. I think you‚Äôre doing yourself a big diservice.

Edit: Decided to delete my advice so no one from the HOCD community can discuss my experience without my knowledge. ### But do you? ### I'm sorry I didn't mean to invalidate you. I didn't really think about the part where I would be sharing your experience without your knowledge. I was just trying to find the reassurance I wanted because I genuinely took your answer and the other persons as the truth about myself, especially since it seemed like everything made sense for it not to be true. I really didn't mean to, I hope you can forgive me. I will delete the post. ### What do you mean? ### I accept your apology. Seriously though, you should stay off the internet. If you don‚Äôt have access to therapy, getting off reddit is the next best thing. Every time you ask for reassurance you are feeding a monster. Ocd is seriously a monster. I got a bit dramatic with you because my experience with ocd was so painful. I wish you were in a place where it was safe to get help. The worlds messed up. I really do hope things get better for you. ### Do you like guys? Or you you like girls? ### Atm it's as if I've lost my desire to them, when I see a guy I have to check and make sure I do still like them (as if I'm forcing myself) till I'm satisfied. I get a feeling of attraction when I see some girls then I feel uncomfortable afterwards and sometimes I try to visualise them next to me to make sure I don't actually feel attraction. ### You know in order to live a happy life you have to make peace with your sexuality. If you are attracted to women, that's a beautiful thing. If you're not attracted to men that's ok. You need to allow yourself to have those feelings and a good erp exposure could be to stop visualising the girl and think:"" I don't know if i liked her, maybe I did, maybe I didn't. Can't know for sure if this makes me gay"". ### This attraction happened before which made me obsess, then the ocd went away for a few months and the attraction for girls went away too and I go back to liking boys which feels more comfortable until the ocd comes back again.

I stupidly tried to get off it last year and now my OCD is back and worse than before. My advice, if the Prozac works, DON‚ÄôT COME OFF IT. I tried and now I‚Äôm in hell with OCD intrusive thoughts. ### [deleted] ### I take 80mg Prozac for my OCD and it is the most effective SSRI I have tried. ### Yes I find 60mg helpful ### Yes on it now. Makes things worse at first but seems to help a fair amount  afterwards. Started w 30 now on 40 mg.  Less side affects than lexa for me. Not a cure used in tandem w erp and cbt. ### Yes I used it for 12 years at 80mg, worked great then it just stopped working.  But I loved it. ### I was on it for around 5 months last year but stopped suddenly and just started at 30 literally today again! I find that it did help me alongside therapy ### I just started it and it upped my dose. Everyone says it's working but we're getting to the dosages that's supposed to help with my ruminating.

With that being said other than some vivid dreams it's not bad. One of the better medications I've tried for my OCD. ### i‚Äôm starting prozac in about a month and a half!! hopefully it works for both of us (if that‚Äôs what you decide to take) :) ### Yea been on it for a year, honestly not been as helpful as I‚Äôd like.. try it tho you never know what might work for you ### For me personally it didn't help, but it didn't cause issues so I was on 80 milligrams for years, tapering off it was so much easier than any psychiatric medication, which is probably largely attributed to it's extremely long half-life, but I'm not a doctor. It didn't really help, but unlike other psychiatric medications it didn't have much drawbacks. Only upon coming off it did I realize it wasn't helping at all whatsoever, and was also absolutely destroying my libido for all that time but I figured I was just asexual. I've heard a lot of stories of it being helpful, the only major complaint I hear is the sexual side effects, most other psychiatric drugs really seem to have a lot more side effects and noticeable effects in my personal experience and from discussions with others. With Prozac I always had to constantly analyse if I felt different, but other psychiatric drugs (not really for OCD in particular though), I could definitely feel something going on. The only thing I felt was the sexual side effects but I was so young when I was put on it that I didn't have much sexual feelings anyway, but there was so much of a stark difference coming off it, it could make people uncomfortable but so I won't go into details but in terms of thoughts, physical responses to stimuli, and actually being able to feel anything when physically reacting to stimuli, they were all entirely non-existent on Prozac. ### I use sertraline, i cannot help ### Was on 20 mg fluoxetine before and i would say that the effect is mild? and that you need to use ERP in order to help with your obsessions most of the time. But i noticed that i always have a side effect whenever i increased the dose to 30mg (not sure if others have the side effect as well), like the side effect was increased in anxiety, obsession can be worst at times, get more fearful of obsessions and keep living in fear of the next obsession. Had to endure the first week before i start to feel some sort of good difference on 30mg where i was able to control my anxiety and able to manage my fear and reduce my fear level of the obsessions that i have. But still ERP is really needed, since we need it to handle the intrusive thoughts and obsessions that comes in our everyday life. Oh and because i took it in the morning, i feel that i was somehow able to feel sleepy at night and able to have a better sleep these days. Just take note and tell your doctor the side effect you experienced should you increase/decrease your dose each time. ### I've tried it a few times, it really helped depression/PMDD symptoms, but was hell for anxiety.  I felt so jittery and had panic attacks on it ‚òπÔ∏è.  Just my experience.  If not for the anxiety, I would have loved it. ### It didn‚Äôt do shit for me, just made me more impulsive when I temporarily had a higher dose (40 mg) of it. Although everyone is different and not everyone reacts to medicines the same, so I‚Äôd still say it‚Äôs worth it to give it a try ### Hey, I was on Prozac for about 7 years and it helped for quite awhile. But in January of this year I had an intense Panic attack that sent me into my existential dp/dr crisis. I tried to just stick it out but it got worse each day. At this time I was on 60 mg. I finally went back to the psychiatrist and he put me on Zoloft (which I had been on for 5 years at 50 mg. From ages 8-13 ). The Prozac was from 14- 20 years old. I am now on 2oomg of Zoloft and it has helped tremendously, although the existential thoughts are still present sometimes.


I went from having panic attacks twice a day to only once every few weeks . And although the intrusive OCD thoughts still happen, it isn't controlling my every waking hour. I wish you the best of luck finding a med that works!! You can dm me if you ever need to talk!! ### I'm on 60 mg and it's pretty helpful. I notice my OCD gets worse when I forget to take it. ### It worked well for me. But honestly it‚Äôs just trial and error because everyone is affected differently. 

Personally I took a combination of Prozac and Wellbutrin and that worked wonders for me. ### I second this. ### I'm hoping this is the right med for me! ### Oh wow thats crazy, I heard prozac is supposed to be easier to come off of then other meds. ### That‚Äôs because you‚Äôre supposed to SLOWLY taper off and not just stop. That‚Äôs most likely why you had side effects. Also, you can temporarily take benzodiazepines for a week to reduce withdrawal symptoms. ### Great to hear! I just started and with therapy too.

tm11nh,"My mother has a severe OCD Hi! So it's a really long story as it's been going on for about 6 years but im going to try to keep it short.

So around 6 years ago, my mother showed very weird behaviours related to cleaning as i would be scolded for changing clothes in front of her as she believes that the dust would fly towards her and this behaviour keeps getting worse to the point where she has only gone outside the apartment twice in the last 6 years.

 She won't meet with other person face to face as she believes that that they're all dirty. She would wash her hands for about 10 minutes. I cannot touch or move the things inside my apartment. Whenever i get close to her, she would just run away to her room and close herself inside. I also have to walk through a designated route inside my apartment according to her. She has been keeping my dogs inside her room for 3 years now, she won't allow them to even step outside her bedroom.


This has gotten to the point where my apartment is unhabitable as my air conditioner is leaking and she won't call someone to fix the AC making the entire apartment smells bad, very humid and dirty. Bunch of cockroaches and ants started to appear inside my apartment.

My family have tried to encourage and urging her to go see a psychiatrist but she doesn't want to go outside and go see a psychiatrist as she believes that she can be healed by herself. This has been going on for 5 years. This one time, my father just went back from work and picked her up to see a psychiatrist but she didn't want to go at all. Bringing the psychiatrist to my apartment is also not an option as she would just send the psychiatrist away. She also doesn't want to be admitted to an hospital and saying that i would be a bad son to her if i admitted her to an hospital.

I've gotten to the point where i accept her condition but i just don't want her to waste the entire rest of her life like this.

I'm not really sure if this is a sign of OCD or other mental disorder as she has never been professionally diagnosed.",5,2022-03-24 04:20:05-04:00,"At the very least, it sounds like she needs help.

She probably doesn‚Äôt want to go to the psychiatrist because of contamination. You should try and see if you could set her up an appointment over phone or video conference.

One of the upsides to the pandemic is that almost all doctors offer remote meetings now.

I hope things get better! ### Yes, you should keep trying to get her help.  Where are the dogs going to the bathroom?  Oh my gosh.  This is becoming pretty serious IMO.  If she won‚Äôt agree to see a psychiatrist, I‚Äôd talk to your dad about getting her admitted to a hospital.  

I‚Äôm sorry you and your family are going through this. ### Hey i would recommend that your mother sees a psychologist and describe her experience to them, since if she get referred to a psychologist and have sessions , it would be personally tailored to what she is going through. I believe that at least getting a second opinion would be better than none at all :) ### Hey! Thank you for the reply! 

Yeah, i just came up with that idea also about a few days ago as i completely forgot that with the current pandemic, finding a psychiatrist who can provide online sessions would be much easier nowadays.

I'm just hoping that i can convince her to open up on seeing a psychiatrist rather than falsely believing that she can be healed on her own.

Thank you once again! ### Hey! Thank you for the reply. So basically there's a routine where my mother would pick up my dogs every 7 A.M in the morning and 6 P.M in the noon and get them inside the cage to go to the bathroom. My dogs have been fully trained and they understand that if they ever need to go to the bathroom, they would just run to the cage on their own but unfortunately nowadays, my mother would just pick them up, get them inside the cage and put them back inside her bedroom.

My dad was the one who came up with the idea to admit her to a hospital but sadly, my mother would just get angry everytime the topic was brought up and i can't force her to go the hospital as she would just lock herself up in the bedroom and cry all day.

I'm thinking of finding a psychiatrist who provides online session as what others have said.

tmnyj3,"Religious / Moral Scrupulosity Scrupulosity has been something i have suffered from for a long time and fills me with dread and leaves me unsettled all the time.

I remember a time when i would spend an excruciating long amount of time in bed every night apologising to God/anyone that I did wrong to during the day. Each apology would have to be perfectly done or I would have to repeat myself as my brain would tell me any imperfection in my apology renders it invalid or ineffective, and i would get punished for it.

I also recall constantly having to admit all my inappropriate thoughts to a family member or something terrible would be me or someone dear to me.

Even now, magical thinking would oftentimes conflate with my religious scrupulosity. For instance, if I thought of something inappropriate while around a religious place / object, that would mean I meant to direct that inappropriate thought to the religious place / object and it would cause me so much guilt and distress until I apologised (the apology would have to be perfectly executed based on the memorised script in my head).

And still there‚Äôs more‚Ä¶ Contamination OCD would also find its way to combine with my moral and religious scrupulosity. As you would expect, I have spent an excessive amount of time apologising, feeling distressed and guilt ridden.

tmnf8t,"I'm not OCD, but I'm looking for some advice. Hi! Not OCD here (or is it ""I don't have OCD"" the correct way to say it?)

Anyways, I (32M) didn't need to browse much this sub to verify something I suspected: you people with OCD probably don't like self-diagnosed, uninformed people to claim having OCD. I wanted to say this beforehand to be respectful of your struggles, which I wouldn't understand, as I myself have some mental health related issues most people fail to empathize with.

A couple years back I moved to my own appartment to live alone for the first time in my life. It happened after breaking contact with my family, and after renting a room for almost a year, where I met an awesome man who became a great friend, the kind of ""special"" people you randomly find in life, sometimes. He is gay, I'm not. I never had male friends because their constant talking about ass and titties and sex and hot women... (sorry for language, I'm blatantly being childish to show my dislike for those kind of topics) I hate it, and naturally he doesn't care about any of that, so it was easier for me to engage with him, which is really hard for me on every level.  


I'm really trying to make this short but I feel like the human details are important to understand the impact this experience had in me... please bear with me. So we had troubles with both our landlord and the third occupant of our appartment, and we were forced to split ways. Since he was in college and only I had a job, we couldn't really afford to find a place for the both of us, but we tried so hard with a tiny window of time. That week of moving out, the investment in a new home, juggling with my new adult responsibilities, having ""no family"", the frustration of moving apart from my only friend, my own delicate mental health... It was taking a toll on me.

On my first weekend, only days after moving, he came to visit once I had everything somewhat set up. We contacted a friend of his who lived nearby and he came too, because he used to sell us weed very often. So the three of us were smoking and hanging out, my first ever guests. My friend and I decided to go buy something to eat, around midnight, and this third guy was going home. Before leaving I remember I said ""I haven't decided where to put my keys not to lose them"" and pointed at them hanging from a random nail on the wall. I looked for my wallet, and we left.

The very milisecond the door closed behind me I realized I had left my keys inside, which had never happened to me.

I was high, I was angry, I was sad, I was frustrated, I was lonely... I took off my glasses and dropped them, then I started punching my own face as if I was about to become a boxing world champion. I rejected any of their attempts to stop my tantrum, I insulted myself and very rudely asked them to ""just leave"", but my friend still had most of his stuff inside.

I sat outside the door while they went to try and find a solution. They really tried, but I ended asking my friend for his phone to call a locksmith. When the door was finally open, my friend took his things and very softly wished me a good night, hoping to talk in the morning. I barely could look him in the eye and nod.

I immediately deleted his number and broke contact with him, purely out of shame.

To this day, I find myself trying to leave home, with one hand gripping the handle, and the other holding the keys. I look at the keys, then look at the door, unable to close it, back and forth a couple times. It takes me about 10 seconds to convince myself that those are MY keys, those are the keys to THAT door (I don't even have any other keyrings!)... and I still close the door somewhat terrified. If the keys are in my pocket, and I touch them to confirm, I still need to take them out and look at them, or else I can't close the door.  


Is this somewhat related to your experiences? How do you deal with something like this? Should I seek professional help? And please be polite if this post doesn't really belong here, I realize as I type all of this that maybe (Idk) OCD obsessions are not triggered by events, and this could be closer to a PTSD than to an actual obsession. Maybe I just answered my own question, but still, would love some insights.  


Sorry for the long post. This part is irrelevant but I'm happy to have regained contact with this friend (and my family!). We game almost every night (I introduced him to Overwatch while we lived together, and gifted him the game the very day he bought a PC a while ago) and we were considering moving together before covid happened. Now he's finished college and that alternative may come up again, at least that's what I hope.  


Thank you for reading <3",5,2022-03-24 12:55:42-04:00,"I would be hesitant to assign ptsd or ocd to this. It sounds like you had a bad experience and don‚Äôt wanna lock yourself out again. I‚Äôve locked myself out before and it‚Äôs pretty annoying, so I do the same thing. I always pat my pocket multiple times to make sure I have my keys but it‚Äôs not really ocd related, I just don‚Äôt wanna get locked out. It sounds like you had an event that caused some substantial anxiety and don‚Äôt want it to happen again. This is completely normal. ### Definitely ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt have OCD‚Äô, no one can be OCD that doesn‚Äôt make sense. 

Wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs OCD and I know nothing on PTSD but I wouldn‚Äôt claim it‚Äôs related to that either. I think you‚Äôre just anxious about it happening again. You felt embarrassed about it and it was a bad situation  but that‚Äôs all. You feel anxious because you don‚Äôt want to experience it again. Happens to the best of us. Don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever get over having to call a mechanic when I locked my car keys in my car. Definitely encouraged me to buy a newer car though.

Really happy to hear you‚Äôre in contact with your friend again though! It would be a shame to shut out what appears to be a really great friend over something you regret. I wish you all the best. ### I understand, thank you for your response. I also don't think this is either OCD or PTSD, but something else with maybe a tiny portion within the specrtum of an obsession or a trauma.  
It just feels so weird and challenging to go through that 15 second period in which everything dissappears from my mind only to hyperfocus trying to confirm that what my eyes are seeing is true, that it's safe to close the door... I couldn't think of a place to ask what this could be, so I came here. Thanks again! ### Thank you for the kind wishes. And I'm sorry if I phrased something the wrong way. English is not my first language, and I know nothing about the technical terms about OCD or how to refer to it, hence my disclaimer at the beginning.

I also don't think this is either OCD or PTSD but, as you said, a bad experience with maybe a tiny portion within the specrtum of an obsession or a trauma, not necessarily something to be diagnosed or categorized. I just felt someone here could relate with the struggle to convince yourself of the truth in front of you, and feeling comfort in it.

Thanks again, maybe I'll try to see it as my brain avoiding an unpleasant situation at all costs, and maybe my severe ADHD makes more sense as a root to that shielding mechanism.  


Reading again your first line, you're totally right. Imagine if OCD was actually personified, lol. ### Oh god OCD personified? That‚Äôs a horrifying thought haha. 

I‚Äôm sorry if my opening came off blunt that wasn‚Äôt my intention you‚Äôre English is perfect I‚Äôd never have any clue it was not a first language. I respect the disclaimer it was really nice to see not just assuming. Hope you figure everything out. ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tmnf8t/im_not_ocd_but_im_looking_for_some_advice/
tlp958,"Is anyone else just exhausted? So drained and tired of living like this (severe contamination OCD) and not being able to communicate it to anyone in a way that they understand. Constant catastrophising and intrusive thoughts. The amount of time and energy (not to mention money) that OCD rips away does not bear thinking about and ever having a normal life and being ‚Äònormal‚Äô seems absolutely impossible at the moment.

Very grateful for any experience or advice (aside from therapy) on what worked for anyone to help reduce their contamination OCD behaviours!",11,2022-03-23 20:41:17-04:00,"I can‚Äôt even tell if my thoughts are OCD or real anymore. It consumes all my time and energy. ### Between my OCD and my family, I'm exhausted. I think I'd honestly be able to deal with it easier if they all disappeared for a few weeks. 

I'm now just keep telling myself I have to just push through and do things regardless because they won't just go away and I'm letting things and myself get worse all the time. 

Its exhausting, especially since all the issues feel like they're too much to overcome, but I just have to push through. *Uuuuuuuuuggggggggggghhhhhhhhhh* ### Yeah I hear you. It‚Äôs truly exhausting. Aside from CBT with ERP, this book helped me: ‚ÄòBreak Free from OCD‚Äô by Fiona Challacombe and others. But ERP alongside a therapist beat everything, hands down. ### OMG, I identify with this post so much. I don't have anything helpful to say, but I completely understand where you are at. ### I feel the same as you ! At one point i was also really tired and wished that i could mentally rest, but it seemed so bad as though even i cannot rest mentally since i would be fully consumed by the fears and outcomes. It was only until i decide to let the ocd obsession come and allow the worst outcome to happen , did i find some sort of relief and less struggle for it. Not sure if it helps with contamination OCD, but i think you can try to accept the worst outcome that contamination can have on you and try to keep expose yourself to allow like the worst outcome that can happen? eventually you might get used to it and even fine with being dirty and realize that you don't have to struggle as hard before :) ### Hey there, I know the feeling.  I've wasted 2 full weekends doing cleaning compulsions only to go back to work on Monday feeling exhausted and more anxious than ever. But I feel better today. Completely ""normal""?  No, but noticeably better and that is progress and gives me hope.  I think it's important not to look at it in black and white terms. Seek progress, even a little bit and that will give you strength to progress even more. Find something to be proud of that you've done. Look for any way to move forward and not backward. Maybe it's just getting out of bed or going to the store. That can be an accomplishment many times. As for reducing OCD behaviors, think about what ""normal"" people would do when confronted with a contamination fear and try to emulate that. Generally we have many fears but they are on a scale so some are more fearful than others.  Start with some of those fears that are low on your scale and work on resisting doing compulsions for those. Yes, it is difficult and it feels very risky but you know you have a disorder so have to go against what your brain is telling you at times and that is going to be hard. But it's hard already so why not use that pain in a way that makes progress rather than always set you back?  Also, it helps to come up with a purpose for getting better... to motivate you.  Envision what you want your life to be like and work toward making that a reality one small step at a time. ### Thank you I will check this out! Working up to therapy slowly ‚Ä¶ ### What kind of stuff does ERP focus on? Like is there anything I can do at home? ### Thank you for this - I think you‚Äôre right that tiny steps at a time are the way forward ### Yes, it‚Äôs all in that book which is why I found it so useful. You _can_ do it at home, but in my experience it‚Äôs been far more useful with a therapist, and that‚Äôs how I got better. But it depends how severe your OCD is. You might find the book enough. 

The general gist is that you expose yourself to an obsessive thought - so in your case, you deliberately touch something that feels contaminated - then you prevent a response to that exposure. You sit with the anxiety and don‚Äôt allow yourself to perform a compulsion or any avoidance techniques. With a CBT & ERP approach there tends to be some background work first - often something called ‚ÄòTheory A and Theory B‚Äô which is where you look at evidence for the theory that your thoughts are really about actual danger vs evidence for the theory that your thoughts are about fear. And also looking at something called the ‚Äòvicious flower‚Äô which basically works through all the things that feed into each other when you have an intrusive thought and perform a compulsion - what you‚Äôre thinking, feeling, doing. A therapist would support you with ERP, often helping you build up gradually from a smaller, less scary task to the biggest, scariest ones (it depends on their approach).

Edited to say: sorry, I replied thinking you were OP, so ignore the contamination bit if it doesn‚Äôt apply! ### I really appreciate you responding and telling me all of this. Thank u for the tips! ### ",19,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tlp958/is_anyone_else_just_exhausted/

The more stress I have, the more it flares up. The inverse is also true. When I am not stressed and effectively not in my own head, the symptoms aren‚Äôt there as much and I can find myself doing things that I would never do usually. ### Yes. For me it depends on stressors. Sometimes things are so easy I feel I‚Äôve been faking my whole life my OCD. Then truth hits my face when I get stressed or tired or something and OCD symptoms start and tics get worse. My ‚Äùseasons‚Äù and ‚Äùthemes‚Äù come and go.. Tics too, I can have same tics for like weeks or months and then suddenly they change and I have different tics (and ocd symptoms ofc) and I‚Äôm like okay, we‚Äôre doing this now ### Yes it's very normal for most mental health problems to come and go, they very often flare up with stress.

If you can manage your stress, that's half the battle! ### Where I'm at, psychologists **train for 8 to 10 years** to be able to properly diagnose and treat people. For any diagnosis, please see a professional. Anything Dr. Google or Dr. Reddit tell you can be helpful to know what type of professional to consult, but it will *never* replace it. And a proper diagnosis is key to get the most appropriate and effective treatment. ### I‚Äôve largely gotten a handle on mine now, but I still have bad days. Yes, fluctuations are normal. ### I had a therapist once describe obsessions like a ""suitcase on a conveyor belt"" and never felt so real. They can come and go... hang in. :) ### It is. For me, they appear a lot more when I'm stressed out. On times when I'm really realxed and happy I have days where they are completely gone. ### Absolutely ### I‚Äôm not a professional but from what I‚Äôve heard and read it is normal! I‚Äôve also been told that when you‚Äôre feeling better can sometimes be the best time to seek help because you have more energy and head space available to do it. Then your therapist/psychiatrist also has a better idea of your baseline once your symptoms start to fluctuate again. ### for me they get better when i‚Äôm distracted and worse with stressors, as another user said. BUT- DON‚ÄôT use our advice as a sure-fire diagnosis. it‚Äôs not, and never will be. hang in there, and get advice from a doctor when you can. ### Yes! It‚Äôs directly related to anxiety so if you can manage your anxiety, then you will probably notice your OCD symptoms decrease significantly. 

I used to doubt myself at times because there would be phases where my OCD controlled my life and then other times when I was able to clearly see how silly and pointless my worries and compulsions were. You can have OCD but manage it well and get yourself to a place where your mind doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúcling‚Äù to the negative thoughts as much. ### Yea I got what I'm sure is mysophobia and I kinda go in waves of how bad it is. Like when I first got it I couldn't touch a wall, couldn't hug family members, couldn't touch handles or door knobs and I even stopped eating and drinking because of how much it bothered me to go downstairs into that ""\*disgusting\*"" environment to make or get food, and I was washing my hands probably 10-15+ times a day and I had eczema so they were cracking and bleeding almost all the time. It was hell. But through the course of around 5 months I lessened that behavior more and more overtime and it went away a fairly decent amount, then I dipped back down into it again, not as severely as the first time but still a really bad amount and then I came back out of it again and now I'm okay with it and do none of those initially mentioned things anymore. I can't do with especially spit cause I do lose my shit or handles in the fear there's something nasty of them and just a lot of the stuff I used to be fine with but it's still way better. Idk if I'll dip back down again but it did happen before so yea I think they can come and go. And yea stress makes them WAY WORSE. My mom would get hella irritated with me about the stuff I did like showering 2 times a day for an hour+ at a time and when she would get mad it would only make me obsess more and more so it was bad lol. ### Yes there are some days that are worse than others in terms of symptoms but I‚Äôve never felt as bad as I did before I got treatment! ### Yes ### Mine came and went and then came hard at 25 and never left. So yes! I‚Äôm also hopeful that as I settle into life and stressors go down that my ocd will lessen. ### Mine do... I can go days, weeks, .months ok then something will set me off for the same amount of times until I'm ok again. ### Mine comes and goes in waves from unnoticable/managable to dibilitating. ### Yes‚Ä¶OCD is influenced by you. It depends if you want that to happen ### Yes definitely! I have had very similar experiences as you in the sense of symptoms being on and off since we were very young. I started seeing a therapist when I was in a not-bad period - the therapist said that was a good way to do it because I can learn skills now while I‚Äôm in a good place so I can use them when I‚Äôm struggling later. That‚Äôs been very helpful for me.

once i realized i do this, i started second guessing all of my morals and opinions and questioning even the most simple things like, is rape actually bad?? is racism actually bad?? what if other people just have a difference of opinion on these things, id be wrong not to respect that right?? and it's AWFUL. like i don't understand the concept of a middle ground when it comes to morality and belief systems.

tmd9cc,"How do I manage these thoughts, I really need help. I posted this earlier but deleted it due to some issues. 

 

I suffer from contamination ocd of sexual fluids (tmi, I'm sorry) and I've been doing exposures, and due to them I've gotten comfortable contaminating a lot of stuff as a normal part of my life. But the issue is, no matter how much I accept the thoughts and not react to them, I can't stop thinking about it, and how life would've been better without this contamination as it wasn't time consuming, and people without ocd too follow some of those rules and would hate such contamination, so my ocd was somewhat justified. I've repeatedly done exposures in the same place(my chair, bed, etc.), and I feel if it was once or twice, it'd be easier to live with it, but repeatedly contaminating the same place makes me associate it with that activity and contamination, how it has that ""extra"" contamination on it, how I'm gonna get used to it and continue such exposures normally in my life which will make me ignorant, dirty and unhygienic , how I'm taking it too far and how others live in clean houses, other chairs, beds, etc. are cleaner. Everytime I look at a chair(or anything else), I get uneasy. I can't stop comparing to others and to normal standards, and its hard to see the positive when this particular ocd didn't take up as much of my time if I was careful. All of this is very demotivating in general, and its also almost like everytime I see someone do something productive or want to do it, I go ""oh god but everything is dirty, I wish it wasn't so I could do all this in a clean house with a peaceful mind, other have clean houses"", ik it sounds so silly, but somehow it is how it works in my brain. Its like this block. Plus, I barely avoid anything, I just feel like I'm living in filth like a dirty, disrespectful, ignorant and unhygienic human being, and how it'll affect my mentality. Its worse cuz I feel guilty for spreading bodily fluids around and to others including my family, and how they're gonna continue using these contaminated things when I'm not here or move out as well as right now, especially cuz they don't know, they're not supposed to , its not supposed to be there and they'd never expect it.

All of this is really bothering.

I'd appreciate any advice.

Thank you.",0,2022-03-24 10:20:51-04:00,,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tmd9cc/how_do_i_manage_these_thoughts_i_really_need_help/
tm0ttq,"Stress Increasing OCD Hi, everyone! I just want to say up front, thank you to everyone who posts here. I often come here to calm down and feel normal during particular bad episodes, and reading people healing from and confronting the same experiences as me fills me with a lot of hope.

I‚Äôve been struggling incredibly under the weight of my OCD lately. Recently I‚Äôve moved to the city to transition, and since that has become a very stressful situation, I‚Äôve been noticing that even though I‚Äôm happy, I am not mentally healthy. Which is a weird combo for me. 

Context: Both my girlfriend and I got a job recently, which has taken a lot of pressure off, but I have not started mine and my girlfriend has not gotten a pay check yet, and we are kind of low on funds. We already paid to stay a month at an air bnb outside the city (this was before we both got jobs), and we have about 2 weeks left here. My gf‚Äôs work is 40 minutes away, and I am the only one that drives. They planned to take public transport to work, but in the place we‚Äôre staying atm, there‚Äôs no public transport that goes that far. So, I‚Äôve driven them to work every day, gone back home, and then gone to pick them up, which is about 2 hours and 40 minutes of driving a day.

I‚Äôm extremely grateful that my girlfriend works every single day to support us, and love being able to drive them to work, because I feel it‚Äôs a way I can support us while my paperwork goes through for my own job. But, I‚Äôve been up front about the fact that it‚Äôs been leaving me fatigued.

Problem: I have extreme driving OCD. I constantly worry when I drive that I‚Äôm going to get myself killed or kill someone, and this experience has certainly exacerbated it. It has also increased stress in general. When having to deal with complex situations, I get overwhelmed, which sometimes leads to compulsive self harm. I get preoccupied with compulsions at night, pacing and stuff of that nature. And I have started to resort to thoughts of self hatred when under stress, something I‚Äôve been trying to avoid for a while, and this intensifies suicidal and paranoid OCD thoughts. I don‚Äôt really want to be like this.

I have a therapist who I‚Äôve been having problems with. She was initially very good, but refuses to diagnose me with OCD (despite my doctor prescribing fluoxetine for it and agreeing that I definitely have OCD) and barely touches upon my OCD thoughts and largely self destructive behaviour beyond ‚Äúhave you been taking your meds?‚Äù. She refuses to do exposure therapy, etc. I‚Äôve been trying to look for a new therapist in the city for a while but have had absolutely no luck finding one that has experience with treating OCD, or I‚Äôve been turned down because their books are full. I am relying on my girlfriend financially until I start working, so I probably can‚Äôt even afford one right now.

Does anyone have any tips to deal with these kinds of problems? I know I‚Äôm asking for a lot, but I want to look after myself at least until I get a new therapist, and I‚Äôm kind of at an impasse at what to do to navigate OCD and helping out in our relationship while dealing with this kind of stress. Any responses would be appreciated.

TL;DR: I‚Äôm driving my girlfriend to work a lot because of circumstances, and I have terrible driving OCD. The fatigue has exacerbated my self harm tendencies and other types of OCD. What do I do to deal with this in the interim between changing therapists?",2,2022-03-24 04:04:07-04:00,"I‚Äôd try to exercise and meditate a lot, since you do have some time on your hands.  It will help counter the stress of driving.

tkxf4w,"Really bad guilt over a situation at work that my OCD has amplified in my head. How to get over it and forgive myself? So basically I clogged one of the toilets at my workplace and I tried to unclogged but it wouldn't work. However, now I feel really guilty because I could have put my hand in there (there were no visible things on the clogged papers) and unclogged but I didn't feel like doing that in the situation. the reason I feel bad is, what if the next person that comes in believes it's someone else's fault and thereby I have intefered with how this person sees another person? I know it's probably nothing to freak out about but my OCD has a tendency to make feel guilt. Especially, when I could have done something to avoid it. How to deal with these thoughts?",22,2022-03-23 11:56:25-04:00,"Mindfulness, acceptance, and [self-compassion](https://youtu.be/ViJMLeq9CX4), friend! Here‚Äôs what I would do, personally: Allow the thoughts/feelings of guilt to be there, but do your best not to engage with them. Remind yourself that ruminating about this, imagining how it could have gone differently, etc. is compulsive behavior, and that it won‚Äôt be helpful to do those compulsions. OCD tends to make us pretty mean to ourselves‚Äîjudgmental, cruel, belittling‚Äîso it‚Äôs an act of defiance to be kind to yourself in the face of an OCD spiral. Berating yourself and trying to figure out whether you made a mistake or not is OCD‚Äôs game, and it isn‚Äôt one you need to take part in. It‚Äôs easier said than done, obviously, but try to be nice to yourself by accepting the anxiety/uncertainty and not engaging in the compulsive behaviors OCD is screaming at you to do. ### I absolutely understand your pain, my OCD reaches its full potential too once other people become involved, so I don't wanna come here with the usual angle but rather something that helped me a lot - consider the people around you. Do you really think these people would judge someone harshly for something that could have (and probably has) happened to most people in the world? How big are the chances their mind even jumped to the conclusion that the person before them even realized they clogged the toilet? How big is the chance they even have a clue who went there before them? Also - people are very overwhelmed with their own lives most of the time. Do you remember all the mistakes other people made in the last week? I would bet my pinky finger they already forgot this happened. Don't bring it up again. I know the urge is excruciatingly strong, but don't. If you can't trust yourself, maybe you can find some faith in the people around you. Most people are kind, forgiving and as I said, very wrapped up in their own things. I wish you well & hope you find what works for you against this horrible illness. (: ### Medication!!
This sounds like me before I found the right medication. Now, I‚Äôd leave my shit in the toilet and say, ‚Äúfuck em‚Äù ### I know it would be obsessive and probably not helpful to my overall mental health problems, but I'm considering writing a quick information message to the group to where the toilet belongs to and write something like ""I threw some paper towels into the toilet and it clogged because of it. Sorry for any inconvenience it might have caused."" This would be really awkward but just want to get rid of the guilt of it potentially being blamed on someone else. ### Thank you so much. Your comment definitely bring me some ease. I guess the thing that annoys me the most is how easily it could have been avoided and now I have to be stressed instead. Also what kind of reassures me is the I would say everybody can accidentally clog a toilet from time. Wouldn't you agree? ### You‚Äôre fine. You‚Äôre not a bad person because of this. Just chill out and let the feelings pass. ### I absolutely understand that, I hate making 'avoidable' mistakes but at the end of the day, are these mistakes really so avoidable as we think? As you said, it is so very easy to clog a toilet, spill a drink, step on someones foot etc. Everyone you and I know has made an 'avoidable' mistake today. I wanna add one more thing, because I suffered from insecurity about other people's opinion of me too - every now and then, maybe step aside and ask yourself 'Do *I* even like this person?'. Would you wanna be friends with a person that judges people for tiny, common and easily fixable accidents? (Or, if you suffer from low self-esteem, interchange it for your friends/family etc.) ### Im just really irritated, beacuse the situation could easily have been avoided. The reason it got clogged in the first place to compulsive action from me where I used a lot of paper. Ugh I'm just so bored by this ;(( My OCD normally only has the potential to affect how others view me only, but in this case others could be affected by it which is what really messes with me. ### I see what you mean. If these types of people judges other people based on these types of mistakes, then these people probably weren't worth being around in the first place. So if someone is being judged it would be more because of them rather than my mistake. ### This is a fixation love. It's not real. You're going to be okay. ### Yes, exactly. (: also sometimes, when people react to 'you' they actually really don't but much rather react to the shitty week the already had or past trauma etc etc. I think a lot times, we overestimate how much we really impact people that are just (work) acquaintances. Like honestly, I can't even tell anything 'odd' someone did in the last week. ### Thank you for the kind words ;) ### So I shouldn't send out that message? ### I definitely sometimes overestimate how much people care about something. In terms of OCD tendencies I definitely need to work on me wanting to have reassurance or to be 100% sure, as I know the world doesn't work like that. ### What would sending out the message do? ### > **I know it would be obsessive and probably not helpful** to my overall mental health problems, but I'm considering writing a quick information message to the group to where the toilet belongs to and write something like ""I threw some paper towels into the toilet and it clogged because of it. Sorry for any inconvenience it might have caused."" This would be really awkward but just want to get rid of the guilt of it potentially being blamed on someone else.

You know the answer. :) I don't think sending a message would make you feel *less* guilty.

Would you blame someone else for a minor convenience like this? No, it's something that just happens sometimes and you move on (that sure *sounds* easy, I know!). 

Toilets clog, sinks clog, staplers jam... nothing is perfect. What happens in the bathroom is no one's business but your own, even if it clogs the toilet. You'd only have the option to feel guilty if you intentionally tried to inconvenience everyone, but that's never going to be the case.

Find a custodian if it isn't fixed, but the important thing is to forgive yourself when you've done nothing wrong. Everyone else is so absorbed in their own thoughts and concerns, that this won't register. A work bathroom is the last thing on anyone's mind! ### Yeah, absolutely. I think the OCD makes it extra hard because it makes so many things seem so urgent and important to us, so it is hard to remember sometimes that other people don't feel this way. If I may ask, are you currently on meds / doing ERP? I feel like this has helped me a lot. I definitely still struggle with seeking reassurance and needing security too, but these 2 things have helped me a lot. ### I think it's just pure reasurrance seeking, but I'm not really considering sending it out anymore. My OCD just sometimes causes me to be willing to put myself in a very humiliating or awkward position just to make sure that no one else was impacted by something that could be avoided. Though, I don't that is always helpful for yourself. ### No meds or therapy currently, although I have thought a lot about the ERP that you mentioned. I think it would be helpful. I'm not against medication in any way but I think it would be reasonable to try some therapy first. During some periods it doesn't bother me nearly as much which makes me think I can handle it on my own but I will have these situations every once in a while where my OCD will go into overdrive. ### Yeah, I would try out ERP first too before doing meds. If you have a strong support system that you can vent to/will be there for you, you can even start doing ERP on a small scale by yourself imo (but take that with a grain of salt, I am not a professional, just a fellow sufferer). I feel that in the long term, ERP is the only true solution because it is the only thing that tackles the OCD head on.  In a way, by not sending out the message you wanted to send to your coworkers, you already did some ERP! (: ### Well, that's a start. I'm still irritated by the whole situation since there were several times it could have been avoided but overall stuff like this happens everyday. ### The irritation is perfectly normal with ERP but it will wear off, eventually. Every step is a huge win with this illness, be proud of yourself! I found that self love also helps a lot against OCD, so be as generous to yourself as you can (: ### ",54,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tkxf4w/really_bad_guilt_over_a_situation_at_work_that_my/

tluhty,"anyone else have even/odd number compulsions? even numbers have always been the main thing for quite a few of my compulsions. for example, it‚Äôs really affected how i spend my time on social media. like if i‚Äôm scrolling through comments here on reddit, there‚Äôs 100+ comments but i see a comment with an uneven number of likes, i have to like it no matter what it says. i usually end up spam liking everyone‚Äôs comments until that compulsion is satisfied and it takes forever. that includes the comments and posts of youtube, tiktok, instagram, etc. and if the like is going to end up an odd number i don‚Äôt like it because that‚Äôs bad luck for me. i‚Äôve always done compulsions with even numbers such as how many things are stacked, audibly closing my 4 drawers and counting to 4, i have to knock on the table 4 times if i feel my stomach hurt or else i will get sick(deathly afraid of that), my heated blanket has to be at 8 every night no matter how hot i get because 8 is a lucky number, jeez i can go on and on about my compulsions involving even numbers. but i got a thought to write this post because it just occurred to me how much time i spend liking everyone‚Äôs posts so they‚Äôre even rather than reading them(i mean i read them but sometimes i don‚Äôt) and how much time in a day in general i spend making sure everything number wise is even. idk i guess i just want to know if anyone else has any weird number fixations and what‚Äôs tied to them.",4,2022-03-23 22:11:01-04:00,"Even numbers all the way for me too! 4 pumps of shampoo, conditioner, and body wash.

So it feels like I'm doing that again even tho it is diagnosed and those other times were symptoms of this.

Hey everyone! 
I'm not diagnosed with OCD, but I have been diagnosed with with C-PTSD, I never spoke of my rituals because they eased when I was diagnosed the first time.

I'm dealing for near one year with illogical thoughts about things around me being real or not. Actually I know they are real but this thoughts about irreality keep bugging me and making really hard to concentrate on anything; doing my job, connecting to others is really hard. I feel emotionally disconected. I fear being crazy.

Thanks",8,2022-03-23 17:48:17-04:00,"I had thoughts similar to this. My therapist suggested I was depersonalizing and that it was the brain‚Äôs way of compartmentalizing extreme sadness or stress. Instead of dealing with whatever IT is, the brain says no thank you and instead thinks nothing at all.

I'm still trying to keep going, but I fear of being crazy to the point I fear my own mind, since it seems that anything is a possible theme to fear. I'm still stuck. ### Thanks for sharing... its really annoying. Hope we can find strategies to overcome this ### I‚Äôve definitely been here but never sought help. I can heavily relate to what‚Äôs being said above and felt like sleep was the only real saviour. I have had mild depression before but the feelings and thoughts of what I experienced, which feels like what you‚Äôre going through, was more difficult and worse than my original depression. 

It does get better, but if I could offer some advice, it would be to try and manage thoughts to an end, and as the original reply states, try and deal with any other issues in your life if possible. This takes the intrusive thoughts that were often abstract in my case, and changed the perspective to problems that I actually had. The benefits were four fold, by making the problem real it was then a) real, b) a source of focus (blocking out some of the other thoughts as I centred my effort), c) more manageable and d) most importantly, in my control. 

As I said, I never sought help, this is only anecdotal. Your situation may be different to mine, but if my experience could help in any way, I thought I‚Äôd share it regardless. You only have one brain, and some thoughts will be out of your control, but you can change your brain to a happier place.

It‚Äôs gotten worse since Covid started (for obvious reasons), and it evolved from simply not being able to drink in the same glass as someone or needing to open doors with my elbows (which wasn‚Äôt that problematic), to needing to change forks when someone yawns (but I can‚Äôt because of what‚Äôs next) for example. 

My mother knows I‚Äôve been diagnosed with OCD but still acts like I‚Äôm crazy. She keeps making annoying comments like ¬´¬†Careful! The glass just touched your hands¬†¬ª, you get the point. When I call her out and try to explain (again) she either plays the victim or laughs it off. I even suspect her of purposefully triggering my OCD sometimes. 
My dad, being smarter, thankfully knows what triggers me and tries to avoid the said triggers.

tlvhtt,"Another day another trigger :,) exhausted and scared today I saw a youtube thumbnail for a video that majorly triggered a pure-o theme I have. hours later I thought I was doing better then a search result triggers the fuck out of me again. it's so hard not to give into my compulsions :(  

All of this right after I got out of a three-day funk after seeing a Reddit post about something that kept me up with terrible nightmares and traumatized me for years. I don't even go seeking out things to trigger me, so maybe I'm just getting more sensitive?  

I feel exhausted. The few days I have off from work are spent going to school, coming home and wanting to pour myself into my creative passions but then ending up scrolling through the same 3 apps, opening up a million tabs on my laptop to random shit I don't even care about, and if it's a productive day I'll maybe play through some games or sketch a little bit. naps have become the thing I look forward to the most yet they suck so much time out of my limited freetime and I can never get to sleep at night.  

It just feels like every time I'm doing better something wants to knock me back down again. I just want to be able to enjoy the last quarter I have left of high school, prom is coming up as well as the spring musical my friend is starring in so I should have a lot to look forward to. Yet I feel like I'm floundering I guess. the one thing I thought I was good at, digital art and writing were my two passions and yet It's hard to do them anymore. I get paranoid that my art ability is suffering because I'm not practicing enough but I can't muster up the motivation to finish a piece. Or when I do, it ends up looking like shit. same goes for my writing.  

it feels like controlling myself and my thoughts has become my full time job. I hate being so glum and stagnant as i'm usually a really positive and excited person. But at the same time this sort of ""exhaustion"" and sadness is more bearable than the constant anxiety. though don't get me wrong I'm still having panic attacks :(

Y'know I suffer from HOCD and ROCD (not my only obsessions but the ones that plagued me this morning). I'm trying to practice uncertainty by telling myself ""I don't know if I'm a lesbian. I could be."" if my head fights against it or shows a bad reaction I think ""Well, if I would be. I would have to accept it anyways."".
This just has one small problem: I have a boyfriend.

Sometimes I therefore have a hard time accepting uncertainty because that would mean being a fraud, living a lie and lying to myself and others which causes more intense anxiety. I don't want to break up or anything, hell my boyfriend is amazing. (Sometimes my OCD tells me I don't actually love him or mean what I say, because I delude myself into loving him ala ""comphet"")

For my entire life, I have always been really sensitive about clothing. I can't wear anything too tight, and have never really been able to wear jeans. Whenever I wear jeans, I can't stop fidgeting with them. It's like I want to make every single wrinkle perfect, you know? Then I start getting annoyed by the texture rubbing against my skin. It drives me insane! Don't even get me started on things like color coordination, ect. That's a whole other story. I also have an issue with changing clothing way too often, when it is not necessary.  Anyone else like this?",23,2022-03-23 09:40:13-04:00,"Yes, and I‚Äôve wondered if it‚Äôs ocd or sensory stuff. ### I have an issue with tight clothing and jeans, too! It‚Äôs a texture thing I think and I cannot get myself to stop fixating on it. I want to crawl out of my skin ### I drive my family a bit nuts because I'm so particular about the texture of my clothes. I can take ages to find a new pair of jeans, because so many of them feel terribly *wrong* to me. And even in the store, I have to shake out my hand and preferably run it against something that feels right to get rid of that feeling. ### Yes.  When I was young my mother made me wear tights and I remember them making me feel insanely uncomfortable because my leg hairs stuck out and I could feel them move with every step (I was under 10).  Now I can't stand knitted clothing which is hilarious because I knit so much lol. There are definitely materials that make my skin crawl.... Like even thinking about them. ### Mine's a health anxiety thing, I think. Tight necks make me think that I'm going to choke or cause a panic attack. I literally have a fear of panic attacks which cause further panic attacks. I have OCD but was also diagnosed with agoraphobia because of how severe my health anxiety obsessions became. 

Some people can have contamination OCD that feeds into their choice of clothing. Or you can have 'just right' OCD that makes you feel as if something bad is going to happen if you don't change your clothes X amount of times. 

If clothes don't 'feel right' to me, I'll change until it feels right. Even if the clothes don't match or look good together. Some days are easier than others and I can coordinate an outfit that looks cute, other days if I'm feeling more anxious I just go with loose clothing. On bad days, I don't leave the house. :/

Either way, you're definitely not alone OP. OCD sucks butt. ### I‚Äôm like this with shoes. I‚Äôm in between sizes 10.5 and 11 and the 10.5 feels too tight and the 11 feels too roomy so I overthink about which one is the best lol ### I have an opposite issue that I cant have a bear skin almost anywhere... ### I wear a lot of loose clothing but I have these three really nice hoodies from Naketano that are very tight and fitted and I have to talk to myself and calm myself down before putting them on and remind myself that I can always cut myself out if I need to, but still verge on panic attack every time I put them on. The way they fit so tightly around my chest and arms is too constricting. I also hate wrinkled shirts and used to obsess about why celebrities and people I saw in the media never had wrinkles and I couldn't get in a car without my shirt getting wrinkled. ### Yes!!!! I love when it‚Äôs finally warm because I can wear bathing suits which means less fabric sensation on my skin. I also am not sure if this is sensory or something else because of how my kind fixates on it. Probably a combo. ### Yep, I don‚Äôt wear jeans cus I have the thought ‚Äúuncomfortable‚Äù same with tight clothing not so much on color coordination but I really don‚Äôt like wearing blank colors it feels weird I like designs ### This could be either a sensory issue or OCD. If there is a real sensation (aside from groinal response and other involuntary sensations) linked to a compulsion, it's usually due to sensory discomfort. If you're not sure which it is, sit with the feeling. If it gets better that's anxiety/OCD, if it doesn't that's sensory issues. ### Sounds like TOCD to me ### I have a problem with clothing to it can only have zip can't wear shirts or nothing it would freak me out far to much but I can wear jeans üôÉ ### Yes! I've had problems wearing some t shirts and I have to do some compulsions to use them, but some others I don't have a problem wearing them. ### I definitely used to. Not anymore though. ### I have sensory issues with anything that is tight to the point where it feels restrictive. The worst is trying to sleep in pajamas. I panic if I wake up and they're twisted all over the place. I don't think it's OCD, but I relate to the sensitivities. ### If i have to go anywhere important i wear my lucky pants lol ### My issue is more with underwear. I only wear it when I leave my home. I find in uncomfortable at home even though I buy the expensive ones that don't ride up.

It's almost like I am triggered at home or it feels like an anchor....and I have to take them off. 

BTW I haven't worn jeans for years either. ### Yes. I don't like anything near my neck. I need V-neck or scoop-neck clothes. And tags on shirts drive me mad. Nothing heavy or scratchy. I prefer to wear black or grey. I like colors in my environment, but not on me. 

In a perfect world, I'd have a wardrobe of light and airy, well-worn, loose, black linen rompers. Some soft cashmere sweaters and blankets for cooler moments, too. ### Yes. I‚Äôm fine with jeans most of the time, but have always had issues with small amounts of discomfort with clothing. i have a fear of green (i associate it with a word i can‚Äôt say, and poison and stuff) and i‚Äôm just recently getting over it to the point where i can wear a few green pieces of clothing. this happens with other items and colors too. when i was much younger, i also used to feel empathy for my clothing, which is still something that crops up occasionally with my more recent ocd. ### Yes!! I‚Äôve always had an issue with the feeling of clothes, especially clothes that are tighter ### I had problem with socks, if i could felt them too clearly between my toes, or little too wrongly rotated i would go insane. I still have a problem with stains in clothes and my belts tightness. ### If you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please do not hesitate to talk to someone.

They are just thoughts, thoughts do not dictate reality. You did not hurt children and you are never going to hurt children. It is the actions that matter, and I confidently say you will never harm a child. 

Also, the fact that you are having these thoughts and that they bother you says to me that you care deeply about the well being of children, but the OCD is doing its OCD thing where it takes  values you have and distorts it to scare you with what ifs. In this case it is ""What if I want to harm children?"" You even said you know you arent a p. Its hard but try to do some exposures where you hang out with your nephew and try hard to bare the discomfort even if its just for a few minutes. Be in a setting where you are able to go in and out of conversations and interactions with them, so you are able to leave the situation if the thoughts get too hard to bare. You gotta start from somewhere. Ik its easier said than done though. I wish for the best for you! OCD is fucking hard. But we have to live with it.

I didn't even notice I was having mood swings until my boyfriend pointed them out because he was concerned. I've been cycling between really happy and really not happy for a while now.

The crux of this was a situation where my family had a stomach bug, which sent me into a horrible breakdown because I have a pretty bad phobia of anything involving throwing up.

I‚Äôve been reading up on ERP and doing a lot of things that my therapist says are helpful - and they are helpful, on days when my anxiety is not as bad. But on the bad days, it feels like the threat/fear is so real that I have no choice but to do the compulsions.

That being said, if you can't stop thinking about a thing reach out to a friend, ask them for support in the form of a distraction.

tlnt82,"Bedwetting and OCD I primarily have contamination OCD, and this past year (28 years old) have began having intermittent bedwetting problems. I used to wet the bed as a kid and stopped at age 12.

Anything that is in direct proximity when this happens is tainted. Fell asleep on the couch wearing my favourite skirt and wet myself, now both are ruined to me. My bed and my sheets, and many pairs of underwear have gained this status as well.

I can't bring myself to throw these things out but not only do they remain contaminated in my kind after washing, but articles of clothes that are washed or stored together with anything that has had pee on it become contaminated. My entire skirt drawer and underwear drawer have been begging me to throw everything away but I don't have the money to be throwing out clothing like that. I want a new bed, but that's entirely to expensive and I'm afraid I'll just wet that bed too.

This seems illogical to me yet I cannot get it out of my head that my whole life has basically been coated in piss.

Tips or advice for how to cope with these thoughts?",1,2022-03-23 20:17:37-04:00,"Sorry you‚Äôre going through this, that must be so hard with your OCD. Are you receiving treatment for your OCD?

I am 6‚Äô5 and 200+ pounds and I have been working out since I was 15 so I am a pretty big guy as well. Even after I recovered from OCD, my default face is just this somewhat annoyed look that makes my eyes look angry and deep and my expression just looks like I‚Äôm pissed off.

It makes me feel down,26,2022-03-23 11:01:12-04:00,"YES, this has been a major theme for me. It's what would trigger many of my compulsions. I'd get a sudden intrusive thought that was like "" You need to do \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. Or else your mom's gonna be brutally murdered!"" Thoughts similar to this would commonly trigger my compulsions. Thoughts of this nature occurred with multiple family members, and happened many times in a day. ### I thought I was the only one with this. When I was a child I would have panic attacks at night obsessing and ruminating over my parents dying or even me dying that I was praying over and over and over again and it became a compulsion. My ocd now has morphed into multiple different themes rather than just hyper focusing on my loved ones dying. I think the worst part is how real it feels. It can really eat you up inside ### It is. At least for me regarding my grandma due to stupid covid. OCD wants me to believe it's an objective cause of worry, but obsessing is never objective, I guess.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/OCD) if you have any questions or concerns.* ### I can‚Äôt really speak for others but this is one of my biggest issues. Logically I know it is irrational. Well irrational in the sense that me calling or texting them to make sure they are okay will not help in any way weather or not they *really* are dead or hurt etc BUT to give myself any peace of mind I NEED to, if anything just to stop my constant worrying. Logically it‚Äôs unlikely but it‚Äôs like okay but it‚Äôs not IMPOSSIBLE so I should check just to make sure. I am aware enough to see it is irrational and does not actually help anything other than to temporarily calm myself and I don‚Äôt want to constantly ask someone if they are dead or dying etc so I tend to reword things to make it less obvious? 

Example, I‚Äôm worried my house is on fire and going to burn down because I bumped into the stove or I didn‚Äôt blow out the candle I did blow out but maybe I forgot and didn‚Äôt. Then I replay my own actions over and over to try and recall if I did or didn‚Äôt, this often does not help me relax. From there I try to decide if I should go home but feeling guilty about going home to check on something that is probably fine. Probably. Then I get anxious what if it ISNT. Solution? I text my wife to ask her if she got home safely and how the cats are doing. This sounds like a normal enough text but it‚Äôs only because I personally know I‚Äôm being irrational and asking her almost everyday if she‚Äôs dead, if the house is on fire, if the cats are dead etc sounds nuts. 

I can see myself doing these things even if part of me knows it‚Äôs irrational but it‚Äôs like I HAVE to make sure. If I can‚Äôt resolve it myself then I ask someone else to confirm whatever it is, is okay. Sometimes that helps and other times I still need to go see for myself. Over and over and over. 

I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre struggling too. Just try to be compassionate and patient with yourself. OCD is not easy to deal with and it‚Äôs exhausting mentally and physically but you‚Äôre doing your best and that‚Äôs enough. ### Major theme for me, specifically my dad dying. I remember losing sleep over it from age 4 on. Makes no sense either given how little I like him compared to other family members. Now that I‚Äôm a mom it‚Äôs all tunneled into my 2 kids. I‚Äôm convinced they won‚Äôt make it to adulthood. Yayyyy ocd ### Hey worrying about bad things happening to you or your family is very common.

If OCD is not holding a gun against your head then it will try to hold your loved ones hostage and leverage that.

Just know that most of us have thoughts exactly like yours and we just have to accept it as part of the OCD gig. ### bro i deal with this so much with my older brother ### To those wondering if Thoughts of Family members dying is a common theme:

YES YES YES YES YES.

I WENT INSANE FOR TWO MONTHS STRAIGHT WITH UNCONTROLLABLE HORRIBLY REAL FLASHES OF MY FAMILY DYING EVERY SECOND OF EVERY DAY WHICH ID DEAL WITH THROUGH PRAYING LIKE A MAD PERSON. 

It was so bad I‚Äôd stay in the fetal position shivering for hours on end until I was so exhausted I blacked out into deep sleep. ### Yes!! Since I was maybe 7. Only realizing now that it was probably a symptom of OCD because the compulsions were really subtle i.e. hyper-vigilant my parents‚Äô bodies for subtle changes that might have indicated illness, telling them they needed to act or behave in a certain way (not sure why I thought this would stop them from dying), staying up at night thinking about their deaths, asking them to buy me a fire ladder so we could all escape if there was a fire, etc. And I often expressed my worry as anger at them (especially at my dad) for not being healthier and criticism about their lifestyles. I still feel bad about that. ### That's exactly how my OCD started when I was a kid. Except just my mom (my dad wasn't around much) ### 
Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

tls52k,does this make sense A therapist I saw through an online medical care app said I show signs of OCD but I thought I honestly had ADHD with my trouble paying attention and my severe procrastinating. But just today I noticed I sat in my dining hall unable to move until I completed my current task (which was going through my old account on TikTok that has 100s of videos and deleting embarassing ones) or how I just put off showering because I had to read through all the top posts on a subreddit and forced myself to read through the posts besides the content disturbing me... Because. I have no idea why. Or how the moment I'm stressed I go to picking my skin and if I have too many pimples on my back or face my whole week is ruined and I can't keep my hands off. I'm really stressed out right now and I feel like I'm faking the symptoms because of what the therapist told me. Does it sound like I could have it ? Should I get a second opinion or trust this therapist ? Sorry for the rant,1,2022-03-23 21:28:36-04:00,"Get a second opinion. Always always always. I have ADHD and OCD. I‚Äôve shown pretty intense symptoms of both essentially my whole life but it took me about two decades to finally realize I also had OCD and not one or the other. Also from my own personal experience it‚Äôs extremely difficult to get a proper diagnosis through an app. If you‚Äôre in school or even college, request to get tested for adhd. If I‚Äôm not mistaken that should be free. Then go from there. But always get a second opinion (: ### ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tls52k/does_this_make_sense/
tklivu,"does anyone else have specific body sensation compulsions? this post may be TMI but i wanted to ask. i feel like i have certain instances where my body needs to feel correct like i have to pee directly before i go to sleep or else i have to get up and pee again. also after-sex cleaning has to ‚Äúfeel‚Äù clean afterwards and usually involves a shower, my skin has to feel squeaky clean after a shower, etc. also wiping after using the bathroom. 

i think its an ocd thing because of the concept of it feeling ‚Äújust right‚Äù without really making sense. like i can rinse my body off and have no soap on me, but if it doesnt feel right i have to wash again and rinse again. idk if this is under the cleanliness subcategory or the ‚Äújust right‚Äù category, or both lol. 

just wondering if anyone else experiences this, and any other body sensations you guys experience.",41,2022-03-23 00:02:57-04:00,"For sure. Definitely the pee thing- I‚Äôll be falling asleep and my mind/anxiety makes me get up to trickle out a couple drops of pee just to make sure my bladder feels empty or I can‚Äôt sleep. I‚Äôve had this obsession for like 7 years now. I also do the same thing with washing my hair- like it needs to feel clean and I‚Äôll do it multiple times until it‚Äôs right. I also recently installed a bidet on my toilet for the down there clean feeling otherwise I feel like dirty. Also don‚Äôt use lotion on my feet or hands because they feel greasy and icky if I do. I‚Äôm not even a compulsive hand washer. Anyways- I have lots more of those sensory compulsions. They just becomes so engrained in my daily routine that I never stop to think about them until now.. ### definitely the pee thing!!!!!!!!!!! also when i shower i have to wash my hair twice in a very specific way or i physically feel the oil in my hair ### Yea actually I‚Äôve been meaning to post lately about my obsessive shower ritual. It‚Äôs pretty exact. It started when I was little I would only rinse my hair away from my body, I could not get past the feeling of hair running down my body. I hate it My body can‚Äôt touch the sides of the shower or the curtain. When i step out I have to step onto a clean towel and then put on clean socks immediately. If my feet touch anything like the floor or anything with hair or debris I can‚Äôt handle it. There‚Äôs lots more but I am pretty intense about how my showers go. I don‚Äôt know if this is what you‚Äôre talking about but my behaviors are for sure related to OCD. ### Yes to the pee thing for sure, never considered that could be related to OCD ### Same, I always wash my hands and myself in general multiple times until it feels clean. Honestly, most of my hygiene OCD actually isn‚Äôt from a fear of germs but rather a dislike of ‚Äúfeeling dirty.‚Äù Like if I were in a room full of sick people, I wouldn‚Äôt get a compulsion to wash myself, but if I touched something that looked gross, I would ### i get up to pee like probably 20 times every night ### yes, some days I don‚Äôt feel right until i‚Äôve taken a bath even though I just showered the night before ### 100% the pee thing. Sometimes I have to wee 5-10 times before I can finally feel relaxed. Even if barely anything comes out and it hurts my bladder. Also obsessively crack my bones. ### I had to keep pushing and checking my bladder to see if i want to pee, also used to play weridly with my jaw and blink my eyes seperately in numbers ### I have a new obsession with physical sensations of something going in my mouth! Fear of dust, other peoples spit when talking, drops of water from the road. Also other peoples cigarette smoke. It‚Äôs all super weird to me and I feel a lot of shame about it. I end up holding my breath or wearing a mask most of the time. The obsession has definitely resulted in oversensitivity and thinking I‚Äôm feeling droplets of something near my mouth whenever I‚Äôm outside or taking to someone - even when logically I know they‚Äôre not ### Absolutely. The pee thing, I have to press against my nails, my breath, etc. ### Idk if this counts, but it feels like something bad will happen of I don't pick my face the second the thought passes through my head. ### I read something on ocd and bodily sensations before and the patient example had almost the exact experience! With needing to pee and everything, so yes it‚Äôs probably ocd. ### Yes so many. I HAVE to shower before sex and before I go to bed doesn‚Äôt matter time of day. I have to wash my hair and body in a certain order. I have to pee after sex. If I find a hair in my food I can‚Äôt eat the rest of the day. I have to wash my dishes in the sink with soap and water before I put them in the dishwasher. I have to wipe with flushable wipes after pooping or I don‚Äôt feel clean. The list goes onüòÇ ### 100% yes. ESPECIALLY with the pee thing. I‚Äôve pretty much had it my whole life and didn‚Äôt realize till recently that it‚Äôs OCD (also mixed with anxiety lol) you‚Äôre not alone! ### What you just wrote is literally what happens to me word for word. Classic OCD! ### Yes, all of that and then some. The majority of all my obsessions revolve around things having to do with my body feeling ""just right"" or perfectly clean. ### i also have the pee thing, i‚Äôm prone to UTIs(despite being the most sanitaryüò≠) and i‚Äôm paranoid that if i hold it too long i‚Äôll get one. if i touch the soap dispenser ‚Äúwrong‚Äù or the feeling of it lingers on my hands(idk if this even makes sense) i have to wash again but barely touch the dispenser and scrub my hands THOROUGHLY. or literally if i touch the wall of my own damn shower on accident i have to scrub that part of my body again, sometimes over and over. it‚Äôs a lot of washing compulsions, if i go without washing my hands for more than a half hour to an hour they feel wrong and disgusting and filthy and i have to scrub them twice or else i can‚Äôt do or touch anything. i‚Äôve been trying to get better at not wasting so much soap:/ oh and here‚Äôs a gross one‚Äîidk if this counts but when i use the bathroom i have to use 4 pieces or idk what you call them‚Ä¶bunches of sheets of toilet paper to wipe and if i don‚Äôt *need* 4 which is mostly the case i take a couple sheets, pretend to wipe something off the toilet and plop it in so my even number obsession is satisfied. ### Mine is so weird I‚Äôve never heard anyone else having something like this lmao. I have a compulsion where I feel the need to ‚Äúclench‚Äù my vaginal and anal muscles because I‚Äôm terrified of developing a prolapsed uterus or rectum. I have no idea why lol I‚Äôm 18. This has gotten to the point that my muscles ‚Äúdown there‚Äù literally get sore. (If you feel the need to Google, please don‚Äôt). I‚Äôve also previously been absolutely obsessive about the health of my teeth and how white they look. All of my compulsive googling made me convinced that all of my teeth were going to fall out and that I would have a full set of dentures. I realise now after months of worry and 2 dentist visits that my teeth are 100% fine. ### A ton of random ones lol ### Yes. My body feels crooked anyway, so everything has to be even and clean. And I'm going through this phase where none of my soaps feel like they are sudsing up properly so I've been washing twice. Yeesh. ### üò≠ You have trouble with the pee anxiety too? This compulsion started several months ago and I loose so much sleep because of it. ### i have the pee thing too üò≠üò≠ ### same! and i dont have any other clean compulsions like hand washing. i mean i dont like my hands to be dirty but its a different kind of ‚Äúclean‚Äù. like a whole bodily function clean ### yep! and im a woman w long colored hair and i have to wash it daily, which is very bad for dyed hair. ur only supposed to wash it like 3x per week and i just never ever could do that. i know ur supposed to ‚Äúlet the oils build‚Äù because then eventually your hair wont get greasy as fast but i just cant do it. ### yes definitely! my body cant touch anything dirty after my shower like towel needs to be clean (and smell clean), etc. and if i touch the wall or curtain by accident i have to wash that part again. ### same. i kind of realized it was related to my ocd because i can go to the bathroom and then lay in bed on my phone for 10 min, and as SOON as i turn my phone off my bladder feels full but nothing really comes out. its totally my mind. ### Yes!! Me too. Even soap feels dirty to me now. ### 10000%. and i was trying to google like clean compulsions and everyone mentions germs and contamination and its just not the same as that. its the thought of being physically dirty. ive definitely like eaten food off the floor before but i would never use a used towel after a shower üòÇ ### How friggen annoying is it. I take sleep meds because it keeps me up otherwise. Not ideal ### i totally get the new obsession thing. its like where did this even come from lol. i have a newer compulsion to clean my piercings often. not sure why. i wonder if yours was kick started by covid? ### Yep! I wake up multiple times a night to empty my bladder when it reality it‚Äôs like drops. I think I‚Äôve even convinced myself ‚Äúoh I just have a small bladder‚Äù but we all know the little things we‚Äôll say to ourselves to justify the compulsions. ### I even have a weird thing when it comes to clothing and undies when I sleep. Like if the undies don‚Äôt feel right then I have to change them until they do. They can‚Äôt go up my butt crack, feel loose around the legs or have hard material. ### me too!!! i  have a split dye and i try so hard not to wash it daily but i physically can‚Äôt hold myself back ### try dial antibacterial gold bar soap. makes u feel very very clean. it can be very drying as well so be cautious but this is all i can use for years. i bring it with me wherever i go. it is 100% intended for bodily use in the shower so its not like damaging or dangerous at all, but in the winters i definitely have to use lotion after my shower. ### same, if i dont take a banadryl before going to bed i cant sleep ### >but we all know the little things we‚Äôll say to ourselves to justify the compulsions.

My thought process every night: ""I must get all the pee out because if I don't pee out everything, I'll be kept awake at night. And if I'm awake at night, I'll loose sleep. And if I loose sleep, I won't be able to focus in school. And if I can't focus in school, then I'll fail my classes. And if I fail my classes...""

tkua8t,"Intrusive Thoughts Are Back.... I am so frustrated because I was feeling so good on my new meds (cipralex 10mg) and now my intrusive thoughts are trickling back into my mind and are making me so anxious again. I woke up for the first time in months feeling anxiety.

I know that it's natural to have a few bad days even when taking anti anxiety meds. But I am obsessing over me never being able to feel better again and I think that it's making it worse. 

Has Anyone else had the same experience? How do you fend off the intrusive thoughts when this happens?",8,2022-03-23 09:46:35-04:00,"Hey there - I‚Äôm sorry to hear it‚Äôs not going so hot right now. I‚Äôm recently off escitalopram and onto Luvox, just for reference. Getting closer to a month, yes I still have some bad days. My OCD is less physically compulsive and more mentally compulsive. Yesterday and today have been pretty rough for me. Coincidentally feeling the same as you - spiraling at the thought of not getting better. 

I was good for 5 years before a recent break down that sent me down again. I feel for you. I try coping with physical exercise and journaling. Thinking about instead of the thought of never feeling better, but that I‚Äôve been through this before and it does get better, even if I fall down sometimes.

I hope you feel better soon. ### Im sorry for whats happening to you...I had a long time period when I felt good and without intrusive thoughts and compulsions and then since December everythings back again.I got my meds changed in November and I really am tired of OCD. 

I suggest you to talk to your doctor and therapist and I hope we both get better asap! ### Hey, I‚Äôm really sorry to hear that the intrusive thoughts are back. I had an OCD resurgence back in December which really sucked, but thankfully has gone away. The key to defeating OCD, in my opinion, is to be indifferent to it. I know, easier said than done. Do you have a therapist you can talk to? Mine really helped me by pointing out that what I was obsessing about was kind of ridiculous. Echoing what someone else said, exercise really helps me too. ### I'm lucky as my OCD is under control without medication or therapy. I still have safety OCD checking but I only check for 5 minutes a day.

My first point is to say ""What you focus on you get more of.""

Instead of worrying about your symptoms coming back use these two affirmations to combat your fears.

When you notice your worrisome, anxious, and intrusive thoughts say the following to yourself...

1. *""Thank you for that information."" and*
2. *""There's not much I can do about my thoughts right now. I'll just carry with life as normal and check in with myself in a couple of hours.""*

I hope this helps. The point is to break the circular thinking and not spiral back into the illness. ### Thank you for this! I am sorry you are going through the same thing! It truly is awful. But this helps me to know I'm not alone. Man, exercise really seems to be the biggest reccomendation. I haaaaate exercise, but I'll do it if it means a happy brain haha ### Yes my therapist actually told me to exercise too! I am hoping to take up some activities this spring to help work out a bit more. 

I'm sorry you had a resurgence too. They really are awful. But luckily this is proof that they don't last. It definitely helps me when other people show me how silly those obsessive fears can be. With ocd it's sooooo easy to get stuck in your own head. ### Thank you, this is super helpful. That is 100% my issue. I feel fine and then all of a sudden one intrusive thought leads into days of spiraling. Now that I am on meds it can be easier to recognize that it's my ocd and I'm fine. But it's still so annoying. I will definitely try this. Thank you! ### Agreed. With OCD it‚Äôs definitely very easy to get stuck in your head. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so important to be able to talk to someone. Unfortunately, a lot of times it‚Äôs hard to talk to people about your obsessions. ### ",17,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tkua8t/intrusive_thoughts_are_back/
tlqacz,"Is this possibly OCD or just poor memory? Hi, I have wondered for many years whether or not I should contact someone about if I have OCD, but I think here would be a good place to start and then people who know about it can give me their perspective. For many many years I have had these worries that I haven't done something I should have done, and it plays on my mind until I check if I have or not multiple times. This happens many times daily and can confidently say that it has an affect on how I go about my daily life which is so frustrating and gives me anxiety if I don't check. Let me give you a few examples of the recurring things. When I get out of the car for a drive to somewhere and go inside, I lock the door, but almost immediately am unsure if I have shut the car door. So I unlock the door and go back out to the car to check that it is closed, which it always is. So I come back inside and lock the door again, but again I immediately have the feeling that I need to check the car door again. This can happen many times before I finally convince myself that the door is shut. The same theme of doing something and then having to check it 5 or more times happens at least 5 or 6 times a day. The recurring themes are the car door not being shut, not locking the door, checking I set my alarm, not shutting the fridge, leaving a light on, not turning off the oven and checking that I have flushed the toilet after using it etc. The only technique that I have found to be sometimes helpful is to actually say to myself that I have done the thing I was checking repeatedly in my head until I am doing something else and I forget about it. I have even resorted to taking a picture on my phone as proof that I have done it so I can reassure myself when I get the urge to check. I have dyslexia and dyspraxia, I'm not sure if that would have any effect but I'll mention it in case people think it may. Sorry for the post being so long, but I would appreciate any opinions people have. Thanks for reading.",2,2022-03-23 21:01:26-04:00,"Your memory is probably fine. OCD causes people to be uncertain about things. It could be anything, but it's often something important. If you don't lock your house, someone can break in. If you don't turn off your stove, your house can blow up. 

There is something wrong with our brains in that it can't accept the slightest amount of uncertainty. I forget the science behind it but you can read about it if you are interested. 

How do you know 100% that you turned off the stove? You can be very sure, almost certain, you did. But you'll never be 100 percent sure. All of our memories are faulty. Witness testimony is extremely unreliable. The difference is other people's brain accept the 1% uncertainty. 

They'll say, ""yeah, I'm pretty sure I turned off the stove,"" and go to bed. We won't. What can help is putting all of your attention to the task. When you lock your car, say to yourself, ""I am locking my car."" It seems like you already do this. Keep putting all your focus on the tasks you are most uncertain about. ### This is what is referred to as ""checking"" OCD.  I deal with it as well. Notice how many times you use the words ""check"" or ""checking"". OCD is known as the ""Doubting Disorder"" for a reason. It's very treatable and I would encourage you to find a therapist that specializes in OCD. ### ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tlqacz/is_this_possibly_ocd_or_just_poor_memory/

tl9qoh,"Am I gonna go crazy? Long story short someone made fun of someone‚Äôs stutter In front of me cause they weren‚Äôt aware I have a stutter (it‚Äôs mostly related to anxiety). After that I kept asking myself ‚Äúhow do I know who I can trust?‚Äù And in that time I told myself I felt crazy for thinking this way

I told myself everybody can be made fun of for different aspects of their lives and most people won‚Äôt even bat an eye. I was going about my day until someone on my post said they thought this way and it led them to be paranoid and go psychotic. This is my biggest fear and after reading that I almost had a panic attack and it took me 30-60 minutes to calm down. Ever since then i can‚Äôt shake this thought 

I realized tho the reason I think everyone cares I stutter is because I‚Äôm looking through my perspective, not theirs. I realized I was treating my stutter as my identity and not an aspect of me. If someone makes a lighthearted joke about it (depending on how they say it), it could just be a joke and not devaluing me as a person. Realizing this actually makes me feel like a huge weight has been lifted off of myself (but it freaks me out cause I also heard before people lose touch with reality they feel great). But now that I ‚Äúfound a way out‚Äù of this thought that OCD has attached itself to.

A LOT of people with OCD have comorbid ADHD, so it's honestly worth at least going through with speaking to a doctor to get tested for it. I often do things without realizing I've even done them, and it's scary as fuck. I spent YEARS worrying about this, and finally realized that I did these things even when I wasn't stressed out. Which prompted me to get tested for memory loss, which led to my diagnosis. 

I honestly wasn't expecting it, lol, and I'm still struggling to come to terms with it since I always held stereotyped beliefs about people with ADHD in my mind, sadly. 

That being said if it's not ADHD, severe anxiety that OCD often causes or appears with can create memory issues. However, if you're having memory issues even when you're not stressed out or anxious, like I said it's definitely worth getting seen as it could also be depression or dissociative disorders. 

Good luck, OP! ### I think the ‚Äòmemory‚Äô part of ocd is tricky.  It‚Äôs very hard to know sometimes if we truly don‚Äôt remember (and then obsess over that) or if our brain is just tricking us into thinking we don‚Äôt remember.  Does that make sense?  For example, I remember being very triggered once as a teen because I sort of casually took 4 ibuprofen for cramps.  As soon as I swallowed them I was distrustful if my memory, thinking to myself ‚Äòdid I really take that many? How do I know for sure?  What if I took more?  That would be bad.‚Äô  Etc.  Then I tried to convince myself of the memory by doing stuff like putting 4 pills in my mouth to see if I remembered that feeling of 4. ### Take pictures for proof! ###  I keep a little pocket notebook as kind of a logbook, I literally use it to track what I eat, what I buy, where I go. It's helped me remember stuff for work a lot.

The only thing is I've been finding I've been dipping a bit into memory hoarding, worrying too much about not having sufficient info to connect a memory to and keeping way too many logs and stuff. More than necessary. ### Hey, I would say my Safety OCD Checking is all based on memory problems. And I solved those memory deficits by creating a mnemonic system to help me remember that everything I have checked is safely off, locked, and closed.

I still check every day but my checking doesn't own me. 

I don't know if you're the same but I check physical things around my home.

* *Like the front door is locked*
* *The fridge door is shut*
* *The water faucets are turned off...*

...and things like this.

When I use to look at the stove I could tell it was turned off but as soon as I started to leave my mind would begin repeating ""What if?""

'What if my house burns to the ground? What if I haven't checked the doors and burglars break in and steal my possessions? Or what if the house floods?'

The way I beat my Safety OCD Checking was to use memory systems.

It's a four-part system where one part of the process is to attach a specially coded image to the thing we're checking.

Then attach that same coded image to one of our body parts. 

Thus, when we leave what we've checked we carry the information that it is off, locked, and closed with us. All we do when we start to worry is just to scan that particular body part.

This is just a summary of what I do to remember. 

**Please DM me if you have a similar type of OCD.** 

Victory Awaits Us! ### Can you say more about your adhd symptoms not being typical?  I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôre female?  I have ocd, my son does too, along with ADHD‚Ä¶.so it‚Äôs making me wonder if I‚Äôve had it my whole life without knowing. ### ",13,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tktao0/memory_problems/
tldt7d,"Dating and OCD/Depression Hey all,   


I figured Id use this forum to seek some insight and try to learn more empathy. The jist of it is that I (M31) have been dating a really awesome girl (F29) for about 6 months now, though it feels like we've been dating much longer. It had a rocky start: We met over bumble, Im a widower and she has been in treatment for pretty severe OCD and Depression. Initially she didnt really want to date anyone seriously and certainly didnt want a sexual relationship. We just kind of went with the flow and low and behold here we are. We have some rocky moments here and there and these mostly boil down to her sudden dip in Libido and her fear of commitment. Her last relationship was super toxic and abusive so it is absolutely understandable that she is careful, guarded, etc. Her relationships before that werent exactly pretty either from what I understood. I also suffer from anxiety and pure O-CD like obessions and just started therapy a few months ago. Ive been struggling lately because I never know if how she acts is because of her OCD/Depression/Anxiety or if its because the spark isn't there, etc.   


Up until like 2 months ago, we had sex pretty regularly and it was really good. She was flirtatious, experimental and allround we have a really good sexual chemistry. That has subsided. Now we have sex like once or twice a month (its still really good though she struggles with anaorgasmia a bit) and she isnt as flirtatious or anything. We have talked about it quite a bit and she has reassured me that it isnt me and that she just has no interest in sex. Hygiene is one of her themes so I assume and I try to remind myself that this plays a huge part. She has said that in the past she has forced herself to kind of have sex in order to avoid conflict and she was trying not to do that now. She also takes 150 mg of Zoloft/Sertraline which has the known side effect of sexual dysfunction, emotional numbness. I am trying to be as understanding as possible, have patience but I do find myself becoming frustrated because I really care about this girl (I know love her but am afraid to scare her off with those feelings). Sex is a part of love and dating for me and its a form of emotional connection. I dont want to have sex with anybody else and its not about the sex but about sex WITH HER. We do enjoy other forms of intimacy like cuddling, hugging, kissing, holding hands, etc. She's never cold or anything (sometimes). How is it with everyone else, especially women, those with uteruses, etc. ? I want to be a good and understanding partner and I'd never ever pressure her to do anything she didnt feel comfortable. I tend to ruminate and obsess about this really badly so any insight would be greatly appreciated!",0,2022-03-23 16:48:34-04:00,,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tldt7d/dating_and_ocddepression/

But that doesn‚Äôt make the OCD not give you irrational thoughts. And that‚Äôs just it. They‚Äôre irrational. Most non-OCD sufferers get those thoughts too. The difference is, we react to them in a heightened way whereas non-sufferers can just brush them off. You have to just let the thoughts be there. Instead of worrying about them or reacting to them, just do what you want and sit with the discomfort.

tkwjmo,Coincidences and anxiety Does anyone else with OCD struggle with coincidences? I think it makes me feel like there‚Äôs some overarching plan to life. I just need advice on how to deal with this and for someone to explain how it is all just random. Thank you!,1,2022-03-23 11:31:14-04:00,"Haha, coincidences bother me too!  It's just your human brain human braining, no need for alarm.I always tell myself that everything **is** random - which means that eventually there's a mathematical likelihood of a coincidence!

If you roll a pair of six-sided dice enough times, eventually you'll get doubles. It doesn't mean anything that it happened (unless you are playing a game where it matters).

Second thing, our brains are hardwired to find symbolism and sentiment in things. Coincidences are unusual, so you're more likely to pay attention to them and potentially assign meaning/symbolism to them than all the other random shit that happens day to day you don't pay attention to. If you paid attention to every event of the day, you could probably find a way to work it into the overarching narrative of your life (considering we're OCD people, maybe do not try this lest it become compulsory lmaooooo).

If you roll a pair of six-sided dice any amount of times, you could probably come up with a theory about how it's random or not random (""oh I rolled a 4+3 = 7, oh my bday is on the 7th this must mean something""). It's based on your interpretation of an event.

Third thing that helps me: how coincidental is it, even?

If you think about the events that take place and the circumstances around them, the possibility of the coincidence happening are probably more likely than you think. It doesn't mean there's any significance to the coincidence. It just means a coincidence was likely to happen.

For example, if you're thinking about inviting a friend over for dinner and then run into that same friend at the grocery, it's not weird if: they live in the same neighborhood as you, there's a sale at the grocery that day, etc., even if it is a coincidence. There's a logical explanation for why it happened. 

I'm not a mathematician or a statistician, it's just how I approach this. There's actually some articles out there that get into ""the likelihood"" of coincidences -  I don't want to link any bc I'm not smart enough to know if they're accurate, but I'd recommend a web search! ### ",6,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tkwjmo/coincidences_and_anxiety/

Derealization has been a big symptom of mine since 2 months ago when i had my first emotional moments. Every doctor I‚Äôve seen has said ‚Äúyou have Generalized Anxiety‚Äù but I refuse to believe it.

(fyi, i am not great at reddit formatting, so i'm sorry if this is difficult to read)... all that being said, i've been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder/bipolar 1 subtype, ptsd, derealization/depersonalization, and ocd, among several other conditions. as you probably know, many mental illnesses are co-morbid and if you have one, you are more likely to have an additional condition. i've had ocd since i was a child, but the intrusive thoughts significantly worsened as my schizoaffective disorder progressed. a traumatic experience basically broke the final barrier that had been keeping my mind intact, and as the ptsd intensified, the hallucinations and psychosis continued to get worse. i don't know how old you are, but many men display schizophrenic spectrum symptoms in their late teens through early twenties, while many women display symptoms early twenties through late twenties/early thirties. after a certain age, the likelihood of being accurately diagnosed with a schizophrenic disorder decreases. that info could help you in figuring out whether or not you are within the range schizophrenic symptoms may still appear. this will probably be hard to read because i'm not indenting paragraphs etc, but i'm just hoping to get some of this information out. you mentioned derealization, which was has been a serious symptom i've struggled with throughout the past decade. i think this has a lot to do with my previous trauma, the events that worsened my ptsd, and subsequent conditions i developed to cope/not deal/avoid/numb/etc. derealization and depersonalization are very real struggles, and for me, they are always more intense during a severe psychotic episode. anxiety is still a huge factor in all of this, though, and it's crazy how everything can be related. i wanted to add that my intrusive thoughts, images, urges, compulsions, etc are always worse when i'm psychotic. ocd really fucks with our minds in so many ways, and it can be difficult to know what, if anything, is objectively real/true. obviously the fear that something else could be developing is very difficult and painful to go through. i am sorry you're struggling with these obsessive thoughts, and i hope you are able to get more answers. if you're able to track some of the things you're experiencing, whether in a journal or on your computer etc, you could use that information when talking to your doctors. for me, my schizophrenic symptoms were triggered significantly from the traumatic events, even though i had already been in the prodromal schizo stage for years. the ptsd made everything more severe, including voices and derealization and intrusive thoughts. if you've gone through something recently that may have triggered (potentially dormant) psychosis, i hope you can get further help and healing. if your fears over possibly developing schizophrenia are more dominant than symptoms of psychosis, it may be less of a schizophrenic spectrum and more related to the many terrifying, disabling battles that ocd causes our minds and bodies to endure. good luck <3 ### i feel like ive been getting worse in this way as well. just kindof getting more and more 'out of it' feeling. idk what to suggest honestly sorry we all have this terrible shit ### Had the same issue when i was 23 i spent 3, yeas with this fear.

So I recently found out I had genital HPV. Ive been googling a fuck ton. Me and my partner have only had sex with each other apart from some stuff we did with other partners more than 6 years ago. We‚Äôve been monogamous for about 5. I don‚Äôt get how I got HPV now????
I sometimes take ambien for sleep and this one time I took it 4-5 hours after having alcohol and woke up around 11 in the morning (it was a weekend)

Anyway, my dog walker guy comes around that time and for some reason a day after I took ambien, I was googling horror ambien stories and how people have sex on it and don‚Äôt remember. Anyway, so I thought I had sex w the dude when parents were in a different room and I woke up in the same position etc with clothes on, same bed. However, I woke up at 9-9:30 in the middle when he came to my room while I was asleep to get my dog‚Äôs leash.

I‚Äôve looked up symptoms and I don‚Äôt have a need to keep things in order, or overly clean myself or my general surroundings. I don‚Äôt have intrusive violent thoughts either.

tlerg9,"ocd attacking interests/hobbies hi so i feel like this is soooo stupid and inconsequential but i dont really know what else to do about it

basically almost ever since i started having really bad ocd episodes i had like ""sub-themes"" where like, for example, when i was struggling with sexual intrusive thoughts, and at the time i was super into this one video game, i started getting thoughts like ""well what if you started associating the sexual thoughts with the video game"". and this just completely drained all my passion and enjoyment for the game, because all i could do was keep checking my emotions and thoughts and see if i really *was* associating the game with my intrusive thoughts. but the more i stressed about it while playing the game the more i started to actually associate them with eachother, or thats what i thought was happening, anyways. i hope that made sense

so this has been happening for pretty much every single one of my interests ever since my ocd ""started"". again it sounds really dumb, but being interested in a show or book and just having passion for a piece of media was something i had always done for as long as i can remember, ever since i was a kid. ever since my ocd got really bad, i cant do that anymore without ruining it for myself. it's really put a damper on my sense of self and my happiness and passion for life. even in some of the worst times in my life i always had a video game or something to obsess over and take comfort in. i can't do that anymore, not without being constantly on edge. seriously, i feel like a completely new person everytime i get to enjoy a piece of media, at least before ocd starts attacking it. its come to the point where ill be consuming media and then i just think ""what if you stopped liking it right now"" and then i really dont know if im actually enjoying it or not, and that stresses me out and then the media starts stressing me out and then i actually *dont* enjoy it anymore. it makes me feel so empty and it genuinely depresses me, i feel like im going crazy

and like, it feels different from when im genuinely not interested in something anymore, or at least thats what i think. i know that i can let go of interests just fine whenever i just dont like it anymore. but whenever *this* happens, its like i still really want to consume the media and enjoy it like i did before, i really do miss it, but everything in me is saying that i shouldn't go back to it, its over, ill just have to find something new again. bcs i genuinely do feel worse if i try and push through and keep consuming it. 

i really didnt want this to be this long but i just wanted to know if anyone has experienced something similar to this and what i should do about it? and thank you for reading through all of this lol",4,2022-03-23 17:04:29-04:00,"this is super valid! i‚Äôve experienced the exact same thing, and although i still struggle with it a bit, it‚Äôs helped me tremendously to just keep doing what you wanna do regardless of the thoughts in your head. i‚Äôm not sure about how much you know of OCD, but OCD is not your thoughts. thoughts have no power. OCD is your reaction to those thoughts, which give it power. By reacting to the thoughts by avoiding your hobbies, you‚Äôre giving those thoughts even more power and making them even stronger. 

to put it simply, just keep doing what you‚Äôre doing, regardless of your thoughts. if you‚Äôre playing a video game and an intrusive thought pops up, just keep playing it. by doing so you‚Äôre taking power away from the thought, and it‚Äôll stop bothering you as frequently.

the first few times will be super super hard, but continuing to live your life while letting those thoughts come, maybe stay, and go is a huge step in recovering. 

check out OCD recovery channels on youtube, they‚Äôll help a bunch. ### I have exactly this but for a different reason.

However, I recognize that this fixation stems from a desire not for the job itself, but for validation. Thinking critically but neutrally about the fixation helps dull it somewhat. ### I think this is pretty universal in people with OCD!

Coping with it is difficult though. I find keeping busy is the best thing, if I don't get into something the over thinking takes over. Not always easy to do, but it's a good defence I find.

Other than that, I find managing my anxiety in general is very helpful and making sure I avoid unnecessary stress. If I do have to do something that I know is going to trigger my over thinking, I have a plan for afterwards to calm myself down. This is usually solved by going for a walk or somewhere with minimal distractions so I can ground myself and basically get my head straight.

All the best - keep trying different things until you find something that works for you :) ### Focusing on not thinking something only makes it worse for me. It doesn't necessarily have to be about my intrusive thoughts, if someone in my brain repeatedly told me not to think about a horse I'd inevitably think about one ### Yeah, that's basically the story with the pink elephant, if someone told you not to think of a pink elephant that'd be all you could think about.
I meant more like when you're trying to distract yourself but your mind keeps wandering off and just won't stop over thinking the what's bothering you. ### Ah I feel you. I often find myself involuntarily ruminating too. In that case my reaction is probably going to sleep, the only place I can be free from the intrusive thoughts ### ",11,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tkru0o/does_anybody_else_have_difficulty_not_thinking/
tkr5w4,"OCD chekking When u chek something and u are immediatly hit whit feeling fear/doubts did i see/do it correctly 
Even when i still see it ?


Only way to get out of this is just belive firmly in what u have done and seen ?",11,2022-03-23 06:48:49-04:00,"I check my door a lot before I leave, does my head in. I make a limit of let's say 10 times to check it then that's it done..leave it, it must be locked or fuck it... but sometimes I break that or the number (whichever one it is) sets me off for different reasons. ### I always check the stove and always think I left it on and taking a photo/video of It helps as I don‚Äôt trust my own eyesight lol, then I don‚Äôt have to check again (not sure if this is a good Meathod or further feeding the ocd but it helps) ### I have some checking compulsions as well.  I think your logical brain KNOWS it's seen and done something but your emotional/anxious brain is overruling that and causing you to doubt.  It's all due to the very strong emotion of fear.  Again, as with all OCD, you want to start doing ERP exercises.  Start rating the things you check by how much anxiety they cause you if you were not to check them.  Then start with the one that gives you the least amount of anxiety (it may still be substantial) and make it your goal to eliminate that one before the next one.  If you can't eliminate it right away, then start with a goal of checking less.  Over time your anxiety will substantially decrease and so will the checking.  Also, I think it's important to not think of it as black and white.  There are still times you may want to check your doors are locked and appliances are off... nothing wrong with that.  It's when you have to do it multiple times is where you start to have problems. ### Okay I have this.

Here is a practical example of how I use memory systems to help me overcome my OCD doubts and repetitive checking.

If you have one grab a small Christmas bell like one you'd put on the tree.

Or you can just grab a necktie which will work almost as well.

1. *Now go to the front door a lay the bell at the foot of it.*
2. *Lock the front door and push/pull the handle to make sure it's locked.*
3. *Now attach the bell to your upper arm.*
4. *Pull the handle one more time to confirm the door is locked.* 

Now continue on your way...

Should you start to worry about the front door being unlocked just see, hear and feel that Christmas bell on your arm.

Remember, we only attach the bell as we are physically checking the door. 

This is how I check everything in my house. EXCEPT I only use my imagination and not real bells. And I only use imaginary bells when checking the water faucets.

For everything else, I check I 'label' different mnemonic images to my body parts.

**Please DM me if you'd like to know more about Safety OCD Checking and this memory system.**

Victory Awaits Us! ### so i have milder ocd and have been through cbt, so i‚Äôm definitely a little more experienced at this and it was much harder in the beginning. but i‚Äôd basically imagine a radius within which the thing would still bother me. sometimes, i‚Äôd walk out of the ‚Äúcircle,‚Äù and not look back, and it would be fine. sometimes i‚Äôd imagine a vine or a rope that was attached from me to the thing, and it would break as i stretched it taut and left the area. sometimes it wouldn‚Äôt/doesn‚Äôt work. but it is something really helpful to think about. it‚Äôs just a little bit of an ‚Äúout of sight, out of mind‚Äù thing, for sure. ### I noticed i was just chekking my phone more often just to feel more safe and tough this might evolve into something so i stopped doing that ### Alot usefull tips thanks. 
Been trying to start ERP but got stuck on really regonizing my OCD better 
Also there is few things that effect my volume of fear/doubt that i have to figure out how to trigger for it ### Feels like this is something i will try and i wish i heard this earlier cause 

It reminds me alot about what i did at one point smilar to this was when chekking door is locked i did one part hard enough to cause pain in my finger for while and that was my bell... and that left me whit bad habit.

tk3a6z,"People don‚Äôt talk enough about the long-term harm OCD has on a person‚Äôs deepest core self-image and world view Spending nearly all your waking hours obsessing over social mistakes, unable to process them like others, will lead to an inferiority complex. Inevitably you‚Äôll see only your flaws and the grand catastrophes caused by your actions, and question if you have any worth. 

Then you lose touch with reality by obsessing about potential solutions to your social problems and pulling your hair out when they fail. Slowly your perceptions get distorted, your sense of normalcy declines and all you can do is charge forward like a battering ram.

Then you realize the mistakes you made, real event and false memory close in on you and now you have another problem on your hands. One that makes you feel deep, deep shame. And now you have real proof of it. 

Beyond any specific obsessions or compulsions, your relationship to the world becomes all about solving. There‚Äôs always an emergency and your mind is constantly trained on anxiety and solving. Years on years reinforce and ultimately centralize those neural pathways as the lens you view everything.",28,2022-03-22 09:41:12-04:00,"This is something I realised very late with OCD, it really messes with your perception of self and the world.

It is utterly dreadful but realisation 

Thankyou. ### This has real devotional vibes for me. Well said. ### 100%  
I constantly find myself baffled when I look at 'normal' people and how they live and deal with the potential for failure or fuck ups or just generally not knowing the outcome of things. It strikes me as so beyond wild to see people just... fly by the seat of their pants for so much of life. Especially as someone who is a creative person, so much of my life is spent agonizing over my work like 'what if I make this and it somehow hurts or upsets someone.' It has destroyed my career and emotionally, it cripples me. 

There's a Frank Zappa quote that's something like 'to avoid criticism you need to do nothing, say nothing, and be nothing' and I've always felt like that perfectly captures what OCD tries to convince you to do. Zappa didn't mean that as a good thing - hell, he's like the antithesis of doing what the establishment wants you to do - and his whole point was that criticism is inevitable so just do stuff regardless - but it was a wake up call to realize that that quote strikes me as infinitely more appealing to be 'nothing' than to try to handle the complexity and uncertainty of regular life.

I've always explained it as 'it's not the criticism itself I'm scared of. it's that if someone levels it at me, I know I have such a brittle/broken view of myself, I will fall apart like a house of cards and destroy myself. they won't have to do anything - I'll do it all for them.'

I know creatives/artists are generally perceived as pretty thin-skinned about reviews, but I'm genuinely convinced that a bad review on the wrong day could drive me off the edge. I'm working on it in therapy, but damn, it's terrible. ### the constant depersonalization/ derealization is what gets me the hardest. i will feel ‚Äúhappy‚Äù (god forbid) for a few days and then boom, the depression sets in and i‚Äôm left blindsided and unable to even recognize myself anymore‚Äî not to mention the over-analysis and extreme cynicism that comes along with managing my symptoms day to day. the world sort of seems like a loop where every day it gets harder to repeat yet easier to manage all in one ### Thank you for sharing, I can definitely relate ### this is exactly how i was feeling then i opened the subredit and saw this. thank you. ### This was actually pretty cathartic to read ### Thank you for sharing so eloquently, I feel this a lot üíñ I suffer with real event obsessions/ruminations from complex longterm trauma starting in early childhood. It's really hard to forgive myself for the way I behaved or things I said in survival mode/when I didn't realise anything I was parroting or mimicking from my home life wasn't normal or okay to say. I was a child, and was never explicitly or intentionally violent/hurtful, but I was quite toxic, invalidating other people's feelings or shifting blame a lot/chiming in against other bullied kids to try and get any heat off myself, and passing things off as ""jokes"" or accusing people of ""being too sensitive."" It keeps me up at night, even though I've had therapy and know this is common and have been told over and over that I was too young to understand or know any different ü§¶ ### I'd like to say not many people are talking about neuroplasticity which gets you out of the  hole and super charged empathy to help others. ### Super insightful and this rings so true it hurts. OCD makes it feel really dangerous to allow yourself any breathing space at all, or to offer yourself compassion because it upsets the normal safety/ritual of your worldview.

There's a theory in anthropology loosely called ""purity and pollution"" where cultural items (people, places, things, concepts, etc.) are considered either acceptable or unacceptable. One of my biggest realizations in therapy is how deeply I believe I'm a polluted person - and HOCD (including real event and false memories) are an aspect of that. Then we do OCD rituals to purify ourselves and seek reassurance that we're not polluted. It's really upsetting when you do have good/happy/proud memories and OCD starts feeding on those too, and twisting them into negatives or scary events.

I only bring up the purity/pollution thing because using it as a framework for self reflection really helped me start to break through exactly what you're talking about, that deeply ingrained sense of badness/contamination/shame/black and white thinking. I started realizing that I was catastrophizing my own self-identity and it was just an unrealistic way to view any person.

My lashing out in anger has lost me jobs. 

Doubt anyone cares why I was ""mean"" and thinks I am crazy. ### Your information is very useful. Thankyou. I wish you tons of everything good and peaceful ### Its all consuming and breaking the distortions apart seems insurmountable. Like I try to do cbt but it's like an uphill battle because I'm in so deep with them. ### Yes! I sense the genpop think OCD is more superficial than it is. They think people with OCD have neurotic obsessions and compulsions, and treatment is just stopping the obsessions/compulsions. Yay the person is cured. I mean I guess they‚Äôre not wrong but they miss the painful identity attachments and distortions in between. We can eliminate our specific obsession of the moment but the instinct to apply the same type of thinking elsewhere is still there. We have core beliefs left behind created by OCD with OCD embedded in it and don‚Äôt know any different. It runs deeper than many think. ### Thank you for sharing this. I‚Äôm uncovering this exact belief about myself in therapy (that I‚Äôm fundamentally polluted) and it‚Äôs been so shattering to face how little self compassion I have within. I‚Äôve been slowly eating away at myself with ocd and self hatred until i completely dissociate. It‚Äôs a terrible way to live. ### Same back at you! I forgot to say thank you for a well written post too - it's very difficult to be aware these things happen at times, let alone put it into words :D ### exactly! that‚Äôs why i also think distractions can make things worse. like the essence is not the content of the thoughts themselves but the ontological being of this cognitive behavior in the first place(also i wonder what is the actual explanation for the development of this disorder). i think i have noticed that if we try to distract ourselves with straightforward intrusive thoughts or somehow make peace with the mainstream themes, our mind will bend over backwards to make a theme that WILL trigger us or like it‚Äôll manifest in different (creative) ways. but this is just my thinking after experiencing real event, i am not speaking with assurance neither do i have any expertise in this lol ### Hugs to you! I had the same realization - it made me so sad to realize how cruel I am to myself, about myself, etc. Something else that really helped me to get a grip is realizing that like, I'm just a person. Nothing about my life is that unique. There's nothing new under the sun that another human hasn't done, said, experienced, etc., be it the best or worst things I've done, somebody out there has a story just like it. We're just people and nothing about our behavior or brains is permanent or extraordinary. 

Showing ourselves compassion is the best thing we can start to do to build confidence in ourselves and in reality again. ### ",471,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tk3a6z/people_dont_talk_enough_about_the_longterm_harm/

tlxnjm,"Cure your ocd with this method RIGHT NOW!! Let's be honest, there's no cure to OCD. All the methods available right now are designed to help you overcome it by empowering you, not cure the OCD itself. In short there's no real cure for OCD. Just methods designed to give you the power to overcome it. That's because the change has to happen within you. You can't change the OCD but you can change yourself. Because OCD is happenning within you not outside of you. I have alot more to say as I was suffering OCD since childhood, But the only thing i know you want rn is that Freaking method to end the suffering, to just feel that bliss you so eagerly await. Alright here's the method https://youtu.be/e_5jx52UeZ4
This is a Mantra which gives you the strength, courage and confidence to overcome all your internal fears. Imagine ending your OCD in 9 minutes; well that's exactly what it does. The mantra is 9 minutes long but the more you chant the more strength you gain to to overcome your OCD.
I completely understand how surreal it sounds to end a disorder with chanting some words, but the only way you can know for sure is by experiencing it. Not by troubling your mind because it can't make any logic of the situation.
I know many of you are suicidal also; I've been there.
So it makes even more sense to not ignore it and give it a chance right?

tl5hk8,"Does this sound more like OCD or impending psychosis? A few months ago, I got really into mental health TikTok and came across the idea of ""feeling your feelings"" and no emotion truly being ""negative."" This led my brain to latch onto this bizarre idea that maybe feeling bad is a good thing and doing things that make you feel good means you're just distracting yourself from your true negative feelings and thus doing fun things is bad. So now if a friend asks me to hang out or there's an event nearby that is something I would have been interested in a few months ago, my brain is like, ""Don't do the enjoyable thing, feeling good is actually bad."" And if I hear someone talking about their sadness, or hell even physical health problems, my brain is like, ""Why are they complaining about that? Feeling bad is a good thing."" I still react in a socially appropriate way, saying I'm so sorry you're going through that or whatever, but it feels wrong to react that way.

I know it makes ZERO sense, literally no one experiences the world and emotions backwards like this, and it's not at all what therapists mean when they say to let yourself feel your true, authentic emotions. But now that the idea got into my mind, it won't leave. it makes it really hard to just interact with people and to live life at all. I don't know what to do to fix it other than just do my best to counteract it.

For what it's worth, I asked my therapist if I could have OCD or psychosis, and he won't even entertain either idea. He said I have trauma, and it leads my brain to have nonsensical thoughts as a way of accomplishing control.

tkwy3s,"I can't tell if this is OCD or just anxiety (Counting, Order, and Sequence) First, I want to preface this by saying that I plan to get a professional opinion soon. I basically am looking for opinions from people who have experienced true OCD their entire lives.

I (26F) cannot tell if the OCD-like traits that I've always had are just little anxiety-quirks that are unrelated to OCD, or if I may have a true form of OCD. 

Basically, I've created a ""random"" number system for myself to make most basic decisions in my life. These decisions ranged from how I used to play with my toys as a child to how I clean my house as an adult. I've never explained this to anyone so bear with me, but I use the last digit of the current time of day and use that number to make a decision. For example, if the time was 11:29, I would take that last number 9 and count from a list of decisions and whatever lands on number 9 is what I am going with. I've used this system for as long as I can remember for mostly everything.

One of my earliest memories - I used to play with my barbies to let my number system determine which barbies were going to interact, where they would interact, and the type of interaction they were going to have. I have never just sat there like you see in tv shows where you see the kids creatively playing with barbies and using their imagination. I also enjoyed playing with my toys like this and would look forward to playing like any other kid. 

As an adult, my entire house is organized into a numbers and number categories and I use the time of the day, the date, and a random number generator to decide on what chores or homework assignments I am doing. I never thought of this as an OCD thing because my system gets me up and moving and stuff is getting done around my place. I even have ""relax"" and other non-responsibility like things on my list. People always describe OCD as debilitating and that it takes over certain aspects of their lives, but I have never felt that way. However, there are times that my number system will make me go longer than I should to get certain things done, like cleaning my toilet or doing the cat litter. But, I eventually will find a way for my system to allow me to get to those chores. 

I've started wondering if I even had OCD because I cannot find any information about an OCD like this one. Counting OCD is more like people consistently counting things and I don't do that. And I don't see any OCD types where people use number systems to make most of their daily decisions. So, I'm thinking I may have just found a way to cope with basic anxiety that happens to be number related? I don't know

tkwvt5,"How much checking is too much and does context matter? I really struggle with checking over things multiple times for work and it puts a damper on my productivity.  However, in my mind I think, well of course everyone wants to do their job well and make sure everything is correct so this shouldnt be a problem right? 

I'm driving myself nuts because I know how to do these things correctly, and even some tasks which I used to spend hours double checking, my boss has since let me know its no big deal and to not worry about going back for those things but if I stop checking one thing because its not important, my brain thinks of a bunch of NEW things that I need to look out for and go back and check over again, and again. 

So its like, while I get relief in knowing I was previously spending too much time on something and theoretically that should free up space now that I dont have to go back, I still end up wasting just as much time because now I have new stuff I'm worrying about. 

Does that make sense? What is a normal level of ""checking"" work?

Sometimes just distracting yourself from ocd makes it worse in the end. Therapy types like ACT and ERP go more into that. Definitely work on finding friends, hobbies, etc. Again, I can‚Äôt say much on romantic relationships bc I know nothing about them, but sometimes it helps to talk to a professional who studies ocd for a living.

tlfsdc,"OCD, Anxiety, and Self-Esteem As an health anxiety-sufferer firsthand with OCD that developed afterwards, I sometimes wonder if my OCD developed as a form of self-punishment and regulation from the anxiety?? 

Idk if I can explain this right, but I used to have incredibly intense panic attacks. In trying to control the situations around me to prevent these attacks, the obsessions and compulsions began. Now I almost feel like I'm self-punishing with it? I attempt to be ""perfect"" and maintain a sterile ritual so that I don't feel anxious and germy, when I know that's impossible. I then end up getting enraged with my choices that lead me to having an anxious bout or feeling unclean. I'll ruminate on every choice I had to not lead to that point for hours, and self blame. I sometimes feel like the OCD is an attempt at negating the discomfort and shame I feel towards my anxiety. Like if I make myself miserable and obsess about how this is my fault, and then do compulsions at least I feel like I'm in control and it's all my doing/fault. When I'm washing my hands, it feels horrible but I also think it's both physically and morally necessary.

tkjd64,"For those who think they can outsmart OCD by avoiding triggers I did that and now it gets triggered by things that didn‚Äôt even happen, what if‚Äôs and close proximity. Before I‚Äôd get triggered by soap and chemicals. Now I don‚Äôt use soap and get triggered by my hand passing too close to soap. Or passing too close to the cabinet where the cleaning products are kept. What if my sleeves touched the sink (they were inches above it). A towel passing too close to the floor. Even shit like ‚Äúwhat if it went close to the floor‚Äù. False memories. Anything. It‚Äôs clinging onto literally anything. It‚Äôs ridiculous. Literal fictional bs. 

It‚Äôs making me question reality. If there is no real trigger ocd will make up triggers and it will get worse. My entire life is a big ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù now. It switched to exclusively ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù. 

Plus, What is funnier is ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù or ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù type triggers are much worse because you can‚Äôt assess the situation and must assume the worst vs ‚ÄúI know exactly what happened and this is what will happen to me now / this is what I can do about it‚Äù.  So you‚Äôre making it worse. Much worse. 

Just a note to those who think they can outsmart ocd. You can‚Äôt, it will always find a way to be triggered .

If there is no direct exposure, not even close proximity, you will make up triggers. Find new triggers. Make up problems. Get false memories. Start getting insane doubts and what if‚Äôs that have nothing to do with reality. Like ‚Äúwhat if there is bleach on my floor and it will poison me if I sit down‚Äù when literally nothing happened and nothing is there. It‚Äôs insane how this works. 

You can‚Äôt stop ocd by avoiding your triggers because the triggers will find you. You have to face them, there is no other way",7,2022-03-22 22:05:37-04:00,"True. you can‚Äôt keep doing or avoid triggers and hope that it will be the last compulsions you perform. If you want to stop compulsions you have to face your fears, get triggered and stay triggered till the storm passes. 

However a lot of understanding and knowledge about OCD is required, first of all the goal is not to stop obsessions as this is out of your control, the goal is to stop compulsions this means that training your amygdala is the objective and trust me this isn‚Äôt easy it will take a lot of effort a lot of realization and a lot of time, but it‚Äôs better to start today than tomorrow because tomorrow is never gonna come when you have OCD procrastinating. 

The OP may sound harsh but he got a really good point, face your fears and get your amygdala to rewire itself by making it identifying your Obsessions as just thoughts and not threats. 

Remember OCD is the malfunctioning of your amygdala due to lack of serotonin (the part of the brain that controls emotions) you cannot use logic to fight OCD as instinct is always over logic. You have to face your fears now or in the future to get yourself under your control. 

I hope people would read OP‚Äôs article and not down vote this article, this will really help people who want long term relief than short term reassurance. Thank you and wish you get better and better day by day. ### Wow‚Ä¶ just wow‚Ä¶ you put it into words for me. ### I don't know if I outsmarted my safety OCD checking but it certainly is not the monster it once was.

This is why I kept my compulsions! I didn't want my OCD to mutate into a different variant. 

I still get triggered every day too. I am still consumed by 'What if?'

""What if I didn't turn the bathroom faucet off properly and the house floods?""

""What if I didn't shut the fridge door properly and the food spoils?"" Etc...

When I get triggered now all I do is install my memory system as I'm physically checking.

I still check, I still ritualize, I still get triggered....BUT...it's what I do with those that makes or breaks me. 

For each thing, I check I just install a memory code like tapping in a PIN number to unlock your phone.

These specially coded images are attached to my body so if I start to wonder or doubt myself I just scan my body part that contains this information.

Thus my mind is put at rest and I can continue on with my life.

I am now helping others but only with this type of safety OCD checking.

**DM me if you'd like to know more.**

Victory Awaits Us. ### I was doing the same thing you talk about. Afraid of inhaling cleaning products, so I‚Äôd avoid rooms they were in and hold my breath in another room if someone was using them. Id think this would make me safer, but then by holding my breath another fear would arise of having unclean air in my lungs. I always strive to be ‚Äúperfect‚Äù in terms of my routine to avoid stress and panic attacks, but perfect doesn‚Äôt exist. I end up eternally disappointed by thinking I‚Äôm in control and are doing things perfectly by avoiding ### OP this is really well put. When looking at it simply, it really is just making sure that we face our fears rather than avoid them.

A bit of a oversimplification, but is also a very helpful way to remind ourselves when we are especially going through it.

I‚Äôve been lapsing pretty hard the past few months. I can say that it‚Äôs definitely been me not only avoiding, but also giving into what for me are the ‚Äúlittle compulsions‚Äù and now they‚Äôve ballooned into a spiral that is having me struggle again for a bit.

But I‚Äôm trying to get back at it and start accepting uncertainty and to stop the compulsions, even the ‚Äúsmall‚Äù ones.

Thanks again OP, and all the best to all of you out there. We got this! ### But I have this compulsion I have to focus on everything around me. For example I was looking at my phone and before I turned it off I look specefically on an app and after I put my phone into sleepmode. But I did not feel in my thumb I turned my phone off. Now my head says ‚Äúwhy could you not feel you pressed down the on/off buttom on my phone?‚Äù What should I say to myself to accept the fact that I did not feel the pressing on my thumb? ### Avoidance is a compulsion. So in the same way any other compulsion will make your ocd worse, so will avoiding triggers.

As for coming up with usernames, you can always just use a random word generator if you can‚Äôt think of one. ### You're right but the thing i'm worrying is my name is very specific to a certain country and it gives itself in the language when another person who speaks the same hears it. It's quite rare compared to other names but they understand it quickly.

tkkigg,"I'm just being irrationally anxious about touching the inside edge of the garbage bin at work, right? I don't really feel right asking this online, but the person I asked irl just made me more unsure and anxious. 

Last week I touched the inside part of the garbage bag in the public washroom at work (small place and the bathroom is not open to the public). I had already washed my hands twice so I didn't want my boss to hear me washing my hands again, so I just thought I could deal with it because I got used to my hands always being ""dirty"" because of COVID. 

Unfortunately, I got really worried about bloodborne illnesses like STIs being on the garbage bag and consequently me and what I touched and spent that night obsessively cleaning my phone and stuff but I put off touching my car again to avoid the anxiety, but I have to go in tomorrow and I can feel I'm already anxious about this and worried I won't handle it.

I am just being irrational though right? I have no reason to worry about that? Its hard to tell sometimes and being unsure makes it hard to resist compulsions. 

Sorry if this isn't okay for this sub.",11,2022-03-22 23:07:40-04:00,"Based on the grossness of it all, I would say you‚Äôre not being irrational by wanting to wash your hands. However, you don‚Äôt need to worry about getting any sort of diseases. The same bacteria on the trash can is everywhere around you. It‚Äôs on everything you touch. You have to remember that you have an immune system to fight off those diseases. Also, in regards to blood borne stuff, you don‚Äôt need to worry. You most likely don‚Äôt have any cuts on your hands, and there is probably no blood or anything from another person on that bag. I touch people‚Äôs crap all day at work and I get worried too sometimes. Something I do instead is keep hand sanitizer with me :) if I feel uncomfortable I sanitize my hands. You may also be able to wear gloves if that makes you feel better. It‚Äôs more acceptable right now especially with COVID going on. ### Unless it‚Äôs a biohazard waste container with needles at a doctors office, the likelihood of getting a ‚Äúblood borne illness‚Äù from regular trash is 0%. So yeah, that‚Äôs irrational. Nothing wrong with hand-washing, but the excessive preoccupation sounds like OCD. ### You will be perfectly fine.  I‚Äôve been there, I know what you‚Äôre likely feeling and all the tricks your mind is playing on you.  But there is an uncomfortably large portion of the population that would pee or poop in that same public toilet, touch that same garbage bag and then walk on out without washing their hands and think nothing of it.  It helped me some to observe other people and notice how gross they were and how unbothered they seemed by their grossness. ### Yes. You‚Äôre fine. You could‚Äôve licked the damn thing and you‚Äôd be fine right now. ### You are not wrong about washing your hands frequently but this is for sure obsessive and unhealthy. My tip is, dont wash it more than once or if you think you are getting obsessive dont wash it, dont clean your phone, touch everything you need to touch, let the anxiety build it is normal, you will feel extremely anxious and uncomfortable but keep in mind >it will go away< everytime you do this you are telling your brain that the obsession is not necessary and after a lot of exposure your compulsion will be a lot less severe. Everytime you perform the compulsion you are just telling your brain its right to make you wash your hands 3 times in a row. ### ask your therapist. ### Thank you for the help and tips. Sometimes I just need another person to tell me that I'm not just lying to myself to make myself feel better. I really appreciate this.

tkvt3a,"Question about compulsions (ruminating) In the past couple of years, I've been hearing that compulsions feed the OCD, and I know that's true. The way to get OCD under control is refusing to do the compulsions no matter what. I get that too.

But what if my mind is telling me that my OCD theme is actually true, and therefore ignoring it is me trying to ignore the absolute truth. (for example) I have real event OCD right now about a dairy product my son wanted while we did grocery shopping. I have been vegan for 5 years, and my wife and kids eat 95% plant based and i myself eat 100% plant based.

Sometimes my wife buys our son some children's desert which has dairy in it. Last Sunday when I did grocery shopping with my eldest son (3 yrs old). He grabbed that certain non-vegan desert from the shelf in the store, I told him to put it back, but he was quite sad about it, and kept pushing for it. So I gave in and told him; just this once.

Ever since, I feel I threw my morals over the balcony and I actively contributed to animal suffering and death (because that is what happens, even for dairy cows).

Now, since Sunday, I've been trying to tell myself; It was just this one time. But then I get thoughts like; well even this one time has contributed to the suffering and death of animals, and I did it on purpose!

Every time I think to myself; Hey, I'm ruminating, stop!

I get the immediate thought; Don't ignore the fact you did something bad! Ignoring it makes you condone the suffering and killing of dairy cows etc.

I then say to myself; Well would I be so harsh on my brother or other friend, relative? No, I guess not, but I should!

Also, the fact that I became vegan and have seen all the suffering and death of animals and thus seen the 'other side' it makes me even a worse person if id actually buy an animal product, because I've been so much more aware of that suffering etc. So that's a reason I'm not that hard on people who are not vegan, because I feel like they probably must be not that aware of the pain and suffering these animal go through, and therefore I can not blame those people as much, but someone like myself who knows and has seen it by themselves and still making those choices to buy those products feels like I am being held accountable a million times more than a regular person.",1,2022-03-23 10:58:00-04:00,"That‚Äôs great you‚Äôre aware of your ruminating. It‚Äôs a good start to battling ocd. Ruminating is tricky with me too. Ocd has a tendency to attack our morals, it makes us feel like bad people, sinners, etc. similarly, ocd also can make us think in black or white. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm either sinful and evil or not‚Äù type thing. We‚Äôre all human, and we won‚Äôt always be black or white in life. You acknowledged that this type of thinking is related to OCD, and you‚Äôre right.  We can‚Äôt be all or nothing in life, it‚Äôs impossible. Challenge this thinking by acknowledging this false thinking and accepting the uncertainty.

tkvrsy,"OCD obsession with a person vs BPD favorite person? I have seen some people talk about being obsessed with a person but I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs the same way as I experience it. I have been diagnosed with OCD and tend to get very obsessed with/attached to certain people in a way that I think is similar to what is often described with ‚Äúfavorite person‚Äù in BPD. It‚Äôs usually someone I‚Äôm romantically interested in and that person feels so much more important to me than anyone else in my life, even family members or closest friends. It might sound weird and I don‚Äôt like it but it‚Äôs almost like I stop caring about other people. My moods also become dependent on the person and if they for example don‚Äôt respond to a text the way I expect or take too long I can get very anxious and sometimes angry, though I do my best to hide it from them. I think there is that idealization and devaluation and questioning the person‚Äôs intentions with me sometimes too.

Does anyone else experience this? Can this be an OCD thing or is this a separate issue? I struggle with some pure O themes but I‚Äôm not sure this is ROCD.

tkri5e,"Fear of never being clean. Can someone relate? Hello I have a problem that I think can be related to OCD even though I have not yet received diagnosis from my therapist.

Basically I am obsessed over the cleanliness of certain body parts but not because I am afraid of germs like apparently a lot of people are.

For example I constantly check inside my ears to see if they are clean inside. Same for my nose, hair and nails.
Also I brush my skin very harshly because I don't want to have dirty skin spots that other people can see.

The problem is that I cannot be clean at one hundred percent because there is always some thing that I missed to check, and then when I discover some little dirtiness on my body I feel very anxious believing that all the people have seen it and I think I am dirty like a man who never showers, even if it is something like a nail with a little black inside, one or two dandruff pieces visible my hair or a spot in my skin that I see is a bit dirty if I check with attention. Then you can imagine what happens when it is something a bit more visible that this. I literally panic.

A lot of people have Contamination OCD but this is not about fear of contamination.

Does somebody relate to this also? Is it normal not to be one hundred per cent clean?",1,2022-03-23 07:10:36-04:00,"I get you, I have Contamination OCD but my concern is the pure cleanliness, not germs too. 

Thing is, no one is ever 100% clean, because you'd need to sterlize yourself, and obviously thats not a good thing to do to yourself.

Funny thing with my situation, I've actually become far dirtier because of my OCD, the stress and low mood it causes has made me go days without showering, not cleaning, and so on. 

Now, of course thats not good state to be in, but I'm still here. Having some sweat or oil on you actually isn't that bad. Excessive washing has done me more harm, I wash my hands too much and even more in the past and all that did was make them super dry, cracked and get infected. 

It won't feel nice to ignore it, but just leave it. Obviously actual dirt should be washed off, but a little black under the fingernails or a little dandruff won't hurt you. ### ",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tkri5e/fear_of_never_being_clean_can_someone_relate/

tkjuhb,"Weed=Intrusive thoughts I‚Äôve been smoking weed for 5 years and just within the last 6 months I get my most anxiety inducing intrusive thoughts nearly everytime I smoke. I act on the compulsions every time and it‚Äôs really upsetting. I‚Äôve gotten myself down to smoking 0-1 time a day but I‚Äôve been so meh today and I know usually a bit of weed is what works best to get me out of this mood but I‚Äôm so scared it‚Äôll actually just make me feel worse because I‚Äôll start to have the thought. To smoke or not to smoke. I just really want to

Update: I smoked much more then I have in a while with my friend and then had the worst panic attack I‚Äôve had in months. I rolled the dice and got smacked hard. No more weed for me",33,2022-03-22 22:31:10-04:00,"I‚Äôm not sure your age and sex but I noticed my tolerance for drugs and alcohol decreased in my early twenties. My ocd got worse which makes sense bc womens hormones fluctuate in our 20s as do mens hormones.

I don‚Äôt smoke weed but it‚Äôs legal in my state and I know people go to the dispensary and ask for a certain kind. Like indica vs diff kinds. I also never got anxiety or panic from edibles.

I personally have been sober for six years. It‚Äôs just not worth how bad it makes my ocd. ### I‚Äôm so sick of the narrative that weed ‚Äúcures‚Äù anxiety. Because it does not. For some people, maybe. Maybe. But for many of us, it exacerbates anxiety. And even though that‚Äôs the case for me, diagnosed with OCD and some other things, I can‚Äôt stop smoking. Crazy how smoking weed becomes a compulsion. I wish more people were open-minded about that. 

‚ÄúBRO IT FIXES ANXIETY YOU JUST NEED THE RIGHT STRAIN DONT GET A SATIVA YOURE LYING BECAUSE I DONT GET ANXIETY FROM WEED‚Äù god ### I smoked pot almost everyday from the age of 11-14 with absolutely no issues except trying to find other people my age to do it with instead of older siblings and 'friends' around the neighborhood. One day when I was 14, I started developing visual hallucinations smoking. I tried different weed from different dealers and the same thing happened (I of course thought it was laced the first time it happened). I took a short break and was smoking regularly again probably within the same year and was used to the occasional hallucinations until I was about 16, totally knew it was just the weed. From 8-11 ish I had panic attacks and what I guess you could consider intrusive thoughts, but I was still so young and not really exposed to anything so while they caused fear, they were still absurd and silly thoughts compared to the ones I have now, the type of thoughts I wish I had now vs what I currently deal with.  


Sometime when I was around 16, I started having insane hallucinations as well as intrusive thoughts from weed, it gave me this uncontrollable and immovable fear that would come over me and when I wasn't high, it wouldn't go away. I ended up having to quit school because I'd start having panic attacks for what seemed like no reason at the time (I hadn't put two and two together yet).  So of course I dove into fancier drugs and alcohol without thinking which seemed to work to make things better at the time, but then I started getting worse while high, and even worse when I wasn't high, started developing false memories as well which even to this day still affects me. And things just went downhill from there. 

I had some issues before weed and other drugs and alcohol, but I often wonder if weed wasn't what made it worse/permanently affected my then undeveloped brain. Apparently brains aren't fully developed until you're about 25 and I'm almost 29 now. ### having this exaaaaact same problem, not ready to give it up but probably will have to :( ### I smoked HEAVY for a long time and eventually it started working against me and caused first break psychosis. Almost 9 years sober now ### i had to stop smoking because it made my anxiety way worse. what has seemed to help with my anxiety/OCD are CBD gummies without THC though. have you ever tried them? ### I'm addicted to weed and it worsens my OCD most of the time, working with an addiction recovery service but currently in a relapse.

I actually am able to fight a number of compulsions whilst intoxicated however I feel that I give in to most of them because I just want to get rid of discomfort and enjoy the high, but giving into the compulsions only makes them more persistent. ### Weed helps me with my ocd a lot ### 100% my intrusive thoughts are worse on cannabis. I have had many occasions where I recognized cannabis would probably make things worse, but I was having a ""meh day"" or ""this is what I always do to feel better"", and smoked anyway, and regretted it. I am proud of you for recognizing a trigger and making plans to disengage.  Journaling, exercise, having a chat with someone you care about, etc are all generally better choices if you're feeling down or having an off day than turning to cannabis. 

Could it be something has come up in your life over the last year that's bothering you, and that anxiety comes to the surface when you smoked? ### I used to smoke weed like crazy but after quitting my ocd got significantly worse. Now when I smoke it messes with my head so bad. ### Try CBD‚Ä¶ or Indica strains

Trust me with the right terpenes you really won‚Äôt be able to think much, lol ### Been smoking for ages, only in the last few years weed has begun to exacerbated my anxiety and OCD. I've experienced the same thing. Don't know the cure or the way forward, but you're not alone in this. ### I smoke my brains out daily and do edibles and I just do my ERP if anything comes up and I‚Äôm fine. It could be the strain you‚Äôre using too. Try Delta 8 stuff it‚Äôs not as anxiety inducing as normal bud ### I had my first full throttle ""I'm about to die"" panic attack the first time I smoked...but after the chill part came I was like...I wanna do that again. Started doin it in and off again for about six years and still got anxiety just about every time but yeah it's just not worth it. Especially since most of my OCD is scrupulosity ### I turned 21 just a few weeks ago üòÖ you may be spot on ### Same thing happened with me. Used to be able to smoke and enjoy it and in my 20s It just started causing horrible anxiety and it wasn‚Äôt enjoyable anymore ### this. this is a side note but i literally feel like no one can have a negative experience with/opinion on weed without getting crucified. so frustrating how weed is glorified when it has literally caused me trauma and has severely worsened my mental illnesses. i understand it works for some people but not everyone is the same. ### No it just amplifies what‚Äôs going on in your life. Also, it‚Äôs possible you‚Äôre taking too much which can most definitely cause anxiety. Delta 8 works great for me. ### After last night I think I‚Äôm ready, that shit sucked and was scary and I still feel it lingering ### I‚Äôve never had only CBD, but I‚Äôm not really chasing medicinal benefits of weed, I want to be high. But high without the intrusive thoughts and CBD doesn‚Äôt get you high so cold turkey seems the only and sad solution ### So lose-lose? You stop smoking weed and ocd got worse, you smoke occasionally and it messes with your head when you do? ### LOL I agree. I was stupid stuck last night ### I switch up my strain often and have smoked for years- I don‚Äôt think a new strain is the solution ### If you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please do not hesitate to talk to someone.

It is still a mind altering substance. Just like heroin or caffeine or refined sugar. 

Based on my experiences and perception of the world, marijuana can exacerbate and maybe even be the cause for symptoms of mental disorders, for example heightened frequency of distressing intrusive thoughts in OCD, worsened executive dysfunction (aka laziness to the rest of the world) in ADHD, or triggering psychosis in bipolar disorders.

My first time with this I was going through a lot of anxiety and I was like ‚Äúwhy do the people around me not feel real?‚Äù And then I had a fear revolving around solipsism. Now I have a different thought but I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôm going to become paranoid. Today is a little better tho but dang, these thoughts are convincing",17,2022-03-22 13:14:34-04:00,"Yes, Mine used to be so bad that I literally could not do anything apart from think about whether or not my intrusive thoughts may be true. ### yeah that‚Äôs literally OCD..

i used to also have obsessive thoughts about solipsism to the point i thought nothing else was real besides me and i was making it all up in my head. it‚Äôs scary, i‚Äôm sorry ### My intrusive thoughts are so bad I still think these thoughts are really me sometimes ### Thoughts about becoming psychotic and paranoid are quite common. My doctor wrote on my notes that I was 'grossly psychotic' when I first went into the psych ward. Psychosis is not something to get too worried about. 

The real devil can be what and how many meds they give you. A lifetime of meds should be unnecessary these days. As long as you spend a minimal time medicated and take them just to heal from the psychosis, then I don't think you need to worry too much if you were to become mentally sick/paranoid.

I have even had 10 sessions of ECT. And I would prefer that over long-term meds.

Again becoming psychotic isn't the problem it's what they do to you post-illness that matters. ### I had depersonalisation quite severely when I was around 16 years old. That was when I started getting panic attacks from them. I remember telling my aunt that she or any of my cousins didn't feel real (she was the first one I opened up to regarding my mental health) And now I can't seem to trust even myself. I've talked with my therapist about this a lot of times. How I can't even trust what I see with my own eyes. ### Yes I do and it sucks. I have a compulsion about Snapchat. I have a specefic way when it comes to downloading Snapchat, but 99% of the time it don‚Äôt go my way and I need to download Snapchat again and it makes me crazy I have this compulsion ### Same! Mines like that today because I got the thought before Emmy anxiety kicked in and now I‚Äôm worried it‚Äôs a sign I‚Äôm going crazy. I‚Äôm trying not to think of it but my stomach hurts and it‚Äôs always in the back of my head ### I‚Äôve gotten past solipsism but the thoughts that scare me the most are the ones that could be a delusion. And I had a thought that could lead to paranoia but it started without OCD at first and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm so worried (I have a post on it if you‚Äôre curious)

Did you actually lose touch with reality? Or did it feel like it? ### The scary part too is when you start to think it isn't your OCD but it's definitely your OCD. ### It's scary how you won't answer basic questions ### It sucks. How long has it been going on for? I rkeveee I had bad OCD for about 2 weeks and then it hit for about a week straight. It sucked ### I can totally relate to what you are going through. I was the exact same but with enough help I have basically become normal. Best of luck to you on your journey. ### It's nonstop these days. I'm desperately trying to find a way out. My therapist is working out of country these days too so I can't book an online session. Thankfully I got over solipsism and some degree of depersonalisation before I was 18. But now I'm struggling with intrusive thoughts nonstop and my self trust has hit a new low. Some days are better but it's never really gone. ### I had a question about trusting others a few days ago and then that connected to OCD and fearing I was gonna lose my mind. It‚Äôs a little better today but it‚Äôs still there. Now it‚Äôs less of wondering who I can trust and more worried that I won‚Äôt be able to trust anyone and go crazy ### I can't trust others either. It's a pretty big fear. I'm familiar with every word you're saying here. I get paranoid after I open up or become a bit personal with someone I know. Intrusive thoughts suck. I sometimes assure myself that it's affecting me badly because it is OCD. (Normally thoughts don't affect people this bad) Which means it is OCD and therefore psychological and unrealistic. It helps sometimes to accept it as my mental condition and nothing more than that. ### It makes me worried that I‚Äôll actually become psychotic or fully paranoid. And that makes it difficult because OCD can give us false paranoia sometimes too ### True. I got a lot of panic attacks. Then I used to accept going crazy back when I was teenager becoz I was so exhausted thinking about it. I believe giving into the fear and accepting the panic kind of subdued the paranoia a little for me because I was no longer resisting, controlling or fighting it. Basically my paranoia didn't have anything to work on. ### ",52,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tk7x91/does_anybody_else_get_so_worried_and_your/

tknjtc,"Am I going crazy? So I‚Äôve always feared going crazy. A few days ago someone made fun of a stutter in front of me cause they didn‚Äôt know I stuttered. After that. Realized how easy it is for others to talk badly behind my back and wondered ‚Äúwho can I really trust?‚Äù

I realized a few days later anyone can be made fun of for many things and I‚Äôm no different. Rather if it‚Äôs a stutter, lisp, religion, sexuality, appearance you can be made fun of it for all of that. I stopped worry about it and later in the day someone commented on a post about it and said they became psychotic and paranoid thinking about people talking behind their back after they did that for a long period of time. This freaked me out because this thought wasn‚Äôt from OCD although later that first day I thought this I thought ‚ÄúI feel crazy thinking this way‚Äù. It took 30-60 minutes after reading that comment to not feel like I was about to have a panic attack and ever since that happened yesterday I‚Äôve been extremely anxious

I was laying in bed and realized 99% of people won‚Äôt make fun of me, and the ones that do I‚Äôll never be friends with, and if I am they‚Äôll show themselves with time. But I was laying in bed and it feels like a weight was lifted off of me. I realized it‚Äôs best to take this stutter less serious.

I've done a few searches and found some people talking about similar things, but I really just want to get this of my chest personally.

I find it so difficult to pick clothes. I usually change my clothes at least once a day a day after first getting dressed, often more. The outfit ""has"" to look good, feel comfortable, and be temperature appropriate. But I find it really difficult to strike a balance. I have sensory issues, gender dysphoria, and body dysmorphia. 

I also feel like when it's sunny and bright and warm I shouldn't wear black or dark clothes.

I've got so many clothes. But I feel like I hate all of them. I feel like I'm always searching for the ""perfect"" outfit and worrying that there's a better one I just haven't thought of.

1. Melatonin gummies. These help me so much but some people i know say it doesnt work for them? Its definitely worth a try. Theres also some in liquid form or chewable that might work faster, but its all whatever you prefer

2. Olly's goodbye stress gummies. I got them because my intrusive thoughts were so terrible i was willing to risk wasting money and buy them (i usually dont take OTC gummies like this seriously) but dude they actually work miracles. It doesnt make it go away by any means but it helps me wind down and think more rarionally. Cant guarantee how itll work for you but make sure to read the label and stuff before you buy it.

3. If you're above 18 and its legal in your state, CBD helps some people i know but if you cant legally buy it or use it then just ignore this its not essential by any means

4. If you're able to, distract yourself from your obsessions. For example, watching a tv show or talking to your friends can help you get to a point where your anxiety is relieved long enough to get sleepy.

5. Sleep sounds help me personally. ASMR or rain sounds, sleep music. It helps me a lot.

The best advice I could give you is to treat the core issue: the possible OCD. OCD or not, its clearly causing you a lot of anxiety. If you have access to mental health care, you should look into it. If you have a therapist, you should tell them. OCD is definitely not something you want to leave unacknowledged; It thrives like that.

It's like you're so afraid of acting weird that it's the only thing you can focus on.

You think other people are thinking that you're strange or peculiar. 

I used a lot of affirmation/meditation to help center me. I grew more confident in social situations naturally and organically. 

These activities permeated other areas of my life. 

Get centered on a daily basis and you'll get less awkward in social situations overall.

With time and with effort. ### Kind of, but without OCD plaguing me I tend to be confident/sociable, so even though I can be aware of my actions at like, a restaurant, if I can help it I don't let it become anxiety, because think about it- you see much weirder people all the time and even the weirdest people you eventually forget. And even they may not be 'weird', just different.

I know reassurance is bad for OCD, but something that ""cut the ropes"" on my social anxiety when I was getting treatment for that is that no one is staring at you. Everyone has their own shit goin on ### ",8,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tketoz/hyperaware_of_everything_i_do_around_people/
tkhyf2,First theme/ intrusive thought? Can any of you guys share your first theme(s)? I‚Äôve been struggling for a couple years now and I wanna see how everyone else‚Äôs journeys started.,7,2022-03-22 20:53:27-04:00,"My first theme was probably 30 years ago but at the time I didn't think it was anything else but the residual effects of being hospitalized for psychosis. 

When I got out of my first psych ward stay I had multiple issues to deal with due to being over-medicated. I started putting on lots of fat and became a chain smoker. Which then led to depression and panic attacks. I already had a Schizophrenia diagnosis by this stage.

Anyway, I mention this because it was around this time that I kinda had OCD symptoms. But I didn't know enough about OCD to diagnose myself. Like I said I thought it was just the residual effects of hospital/meds/Schizophrenia. 

So my original theme back then was wanting to smash cups against the brick wall. I also had a theme around wanting to kiss and spit in people's faces. 

Later on, maybe 10 years later I started counting the gaps between the slabs of pavement. 

Eventually that led to safety OCD checking.

My symptoms are well under control.

I could almost taste it in my mouth and it always felt sorta nasty and kinda silly. It continued on to more intrusive thoughts like sexual and other. But that was the first one. ### Recently I remembered something that I forgot and think that it was nothing to do with my ocd before but now I released it was ocd intrusive throughs. I was maybe around 6 years old and peacefully play with my brother and father. And then I started to have this intrusive thought how I will harm them. I was so scared and whenever I get them I immediately close my eyes but it didn't helped. ### When I was 8 or 9, I remember sitting at the dining table and it not feeling ""right"".

I have apologized to the person I‚Äôve hurt and we stayed friends, but recently they cut off contact with me and now my anxiety/OCD is going crazy thinking about how they‚Äôve probably realized that they can‚Äôt forgive me and I‚Äôm worried about them thinking of me as a terrible person and exposing what I did to our mutual friends/other people.

tk8c4e,Does anyone else wash their hand for a whole hour Every day I wash my hands for an hour 5 times a day,17,2022-03-22 13:33:17-04:00,"I‚Äôve done it before, and it sucks.

Make sure and keep your hands hydrated with aloe vera or lotion. Drying your hands out sucks. ### Been there. Keep ur head up. Also used to use a 44 oz of body wash every few days. Erp and meds and hard work got me back on my feet for a few years until it came back to bite with a new theme. You aren‚Äôt alone ### washing your hands too excessively isn‚Äôt good, it can dry the skin out and make crevices for bacteria to colonize

you should try to limit yourself on how much you wash them but even then you only need to wash them for the length of the happy birthday song to get germs off, not an entire hour ### I used to do that a lot when my ocd was out of control. Thankfully I don't wash my hands as long anymore and I kept it in check ### I have washed my hands excessively but not for longer than 30 seconds each time. The best way to beat this disorder is to refrain as best as you can from washing your hands when you first feel the impulse to do so. The mental pain of not doing so may initially seem unbearably difficult, but you will be victorious with persistence. Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds each time when you touch something unclean/unsanitary or before you eat something. Best of luck. ### I have Safety OCD Checking. I check whether the front door is locked. The fridge door is closed. The power outlets are off. And I worry that a catastrophe will happen if I haven't checked properly. 

When I was unwell the longest a single check of the whole house took was one hour. 

But at this stage, I was constantly checking throughout the morning/noon & night as well. ### I wash my hands a couple times after I get out of the shower‚Ä¶.. ### I used to spend hours a day washing my hands and showering. My hands always looked awful. Then I started taking Prozac and doing CBT/ERP, that helped a lot! Now I feel like I‚Äôm almost Ocd-free ### No but I do wash my hands back to back about 20 times. I sit and re wash sit and re wash my hands are completely raw even with Vaseline ### No and if someone does then they‚Äôre obviously performing a compulsion ### No but I have to wash with soap 5 times in a row to feel ‚Äúclean‚Äù. 

I hope you‚Äôre able to get out of this cycle. I know that has to be mentally exhausting and probably extremely painful on your hands. 

On my bad days my hands hurt so bad by the end of the night. They‚Äôre throbbing and bright red; Sometimes bleeding from washing to much. ### Why are you looking for a feedback loop? Confirmation bias?

Go to the doctor. Get medication and therapy. End of story. It doesn‚Äôt matter what other people do. Time to act like an adult or find one to take care of you. ### But why? Like the deep root reason ### Even knowing this fully well, and doing the experiment where you vary the length of time washing your hands, then placing them on agar and seeing more bacteria growth on the areas you pressed on after washing your hands for longer hasn't stopped me from washing my hands for 1< minute, especially longer if I'm already stressed. 

Ocd is at its core a firm set of beliefs that if you don't perform the compulsion that follows the intrusive thought, then that intrusive thought will happen. The beliefs may be non-sensical, and even seeing sense doesn't always help.

The only way I've cut down on my hand washing is to only wash once, and not that properly, and deal with the ensuing anxiety. It's exhausting, but in many cases, the brain does eventually realise its not a threat and stops the anxiety response. 

Try to understand why you have the intrusion/compulsion e.g. don't want to make myself/others ill, is also helpful.

Both have helped me before, but covid made it worse again... doing exposure therapy is hard but you got this! ‚ù§ ### I think sometimes we‚Äôll never find out. I went to therapy for 10 years (psychoanalysis, CBT, talking therapy), and still don‚Äôt know the cause. I do feel much better though ### i know ocd is irrational and doesnt always listen to reason but i thought it would be worth giving the facts anyways in the off chance they might help with their anxiety, i have contamination ocd as well and studying microbiology somehow has helped me at least try to rationalize with my compulsions so i want to at least give people useful info when i can ### That's completely fair, and I'm glad studying micro has helped :) I just know for me, knowing I shouldn't be washing my hands for so long makes me feel extra flustered and anxious, it sucks and tbf, it might just be a me problem üòÖ but I agree, it is good to consider all angles ### ",10,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tk8c4e/does_anyone_else_wash_their_hand_for_a_whole_hour/

tkbssu,"One of those days Hi all,

Having a rough day, not sure what im trying to accomplish but figured id start typing and see what happens. 

Ive had OCD my entire life, I just recently stumbled upon this community and its helped out as I have felt incredibly lonely the past few months. This disease is so sneaky that no one in the world would know im struggling as much as i am. Ive always known OCD is a big part of me, but after reading these posts I realized OCD is everything about me. 

What do i mean? Every single thought i have is intrusive, Im never living in the present, always ruminating on the past or worrying about the future. Wasting my time about interactions that happened 4 months ago that the person i had it with probably doesnt even remember. Constantly wanting perfection, and the second I achieve whatever that ‚Äúperfection‚Äù in my mind is - it‚Äôs never enough and theres always something more from there. 

Always thinking theres some solution to my problem and if i could just get that then everything would be different, but it never is, its always me. If this was all i had to worry about, i would be able to handle it. I wont even get into the horrendous ‚Äúpure o‚Äù thoughts I get, whether its about me doing something horrible Id never do, fear of going crazy, body dysmorphia - and by the way Im a 25 year old male. I havent even been able to grow a beard since HS because I have almost pulled out all of my facial hair, another thing Im incredibly shameful of that probs stresses me out more than anything.

I tried drugs to help and that led to rehabs and sober houses, that route didnt work. (Abstained from drugs of choice over 3 years but use marijuana)

I guess ive been thru a lot. Just upset today cuz the girl ive been obsessed with is very adamant that we cant be together anymore. 

The weirdest part is - as sorry for myself as I get, I also love this about me. Theres a lot more I want to say, but i wouldn‚Äôt trade my life for anyones. The fact we are all as self aware as we are leads me to believe we are a unique group of people capable of incredible things. Because of my ocd, I rationalize much better than others and I am regimented in things like eating properly going to the gym etc. 

I remember as bad as i have it - theres always someone who has it worse. Im still crushed about the girl, but i think one can tell by reading this that it must‚Äôve helped, kinda talked myself out of it.

Maybe it can help someone else as I know the only way for me to feel better is if i can help someone else. Please reach out if needed, and thank you to anyone that read and to those who provide us with this platform.",1,2022-03-22 16:06:24-04:00,"You‚Äôre not alone!

Also try relaxation strategies like mindfulness and meditation. ### Recognize it's your ""OCD Bully"".  Resist EVERY compulsion and it will go away.  Doing compulsions only makes it harder to not do them the next time and will increasingly demand more of you until it consumes your life.  Your brain will follow your actions and if you choose to do a compulsion then it will believe you need to do it every time.  If you don't do it, your brain will learn surprisingly rapidly that it's unnecessary.  You are in control here.  Compulsions make the anxiety worse and you start to fear the compulsion more than the thing you were originally worried about.  I know this is all easier said than done (believe me I have been struggling big time) but I am learning how this awful disorder takes root and it's the all about the compulsions.  Unfortunately, there's no fix without discomfort.  So to me what helps is realizing this damn thing is ruining me, beating me up and stealing my life.  That motivates me to fight back and gives me the fortitude to resist compulsions.  It isn't 100% and I still fail regularly but I have seen some success.  ERP is the only way.  Sounds like you have enough content in real life to not have to come up with designed Exposures. You just have to do the RP part.  Distraction is fine at times (better than compulsions) but can become a compulsion so I'd say, better to accept anxiety and proceed to do what you normally would without doing the compulsion.  If that's listening to music or doing exercise then that's fine but if it's to avoid the anxiety it could become a compulsion. In other words do what you would do if you didn't have anxiety - maybe that's watching a movie, reading a book, going out with friends, working on a project, etc..  Your brain will learn the truth - that your fears are nothing to worry about. ### ",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tkemip/how_do_i_manage_my_ocd_at_this_moment/

Can you help us? We are researchers from the Clinical Psychology Department at The University of Oxford, and we are interested in learning more about the link between difficult interpersonal memories and emotional responses.

We are interested in hearing from people who identify as having obsessional and compulsive problems, and those without current experiences of mental health difficulties.¬†

We are hoping to develop a deeper understanding of factors that may contribute to distress in this area, with the hope of tailoring and improving treatments for these individuals.

We are looking for volunteers aged 18 years and over. Participating in the research will take approximately 1 hour, and will involve a short telephone discussion, an experimental task via video, and completion of some questionnaires.

tkfyuh,"What would my General Mental Health be like if the Pandemic never happened? Not necessarily Better. Thanks, r/offmychest for marking this as spam. I'm being both sarcastic & genuine, simultaneously.

I think my overly-positive demeanor is used in order to compensate for my internalized cynical misanthropy.

Ever since I was a tiny baby child, I've always had an EXTREMELY positive character. Even when I developed an eating disorder once I got older, was isolated in a treatment center for a month, continued out-patient treatment, suffered a traumatic event involving finding a hidden camera in my bathroom, I ALWAYS stayed optimistic. Even though I know for a fact that during my eating disorder recovery, I had quite the negative attitude within my out-patient treatment, but still the same old annoying, bubbly demeanor (I think it depended on who I was surrounded with, or maybe this was what started it? I digress). Perhaps it was the traumatic event I later experienced which changed me, but I think it was mostly due to my fluctuations in estrogen-- I went absolutely insane; I started wearing the same clothes all the time, my makeup was that of the rodent woman from that stupid Jersey Shore show, I was incredibly loud & embarrassing, and as a result, I was treated very harshly by the people around me, and of course, then the pandemic came, and I suffered an even more traumatic event, and I think that's what broke me. I was put on a strong antipsychotic medication (aripiprazole), which turned me into a dull idiot, pretending to be happy. Not to mention that it made me fat. For the duration of the pandemic, I became depressed & conflicted, and I developed agoraphobia. As I relapsed into my anorexia & bulimia recently and lost most of the weight which I had gained prior, I feel slightly better about myself, but not that much. I think that the pandemic provided me both bad trauma and good trauma-- I have gone on a relieving, yet depressing (in an *anemoia* sort of way), intense journey of self-discovery, and I would certainly not be this way if the pandemic never occurred. I cannot emphasize enough how incredibly important and pleasantly depressing this experience has been. I have educated myself on my own time on a variety of random subjects-- I realized that I'm exclusively attracted to other women, my taste in books, movies, music, etc. has drastically shifted, I have planned in-depth for my future, I have come up with an abundant amount of bizarre yet fun ideas for things I want to create, I discovered that my personality tends to divide much like characters in a novel; it's strange but interesting (no no no none of that DID nonsense), I had my first hypomanic episode in November, and throughout the year, I have developed a VERY cynical, absurdist mindset, topped with insufferable misanthropy. Because of all of these discoveries about myself, I proclaimed 2021""the year of realization,"" which is cheesy, nonetheless true (but then again, the Gregorian calendar is merely a construct, yada yada yada). I still have my perky, cheerful demeanor, and I still always strive to be as kind as possible, but I fear that my doormat of a persona will be taken advantage of yet again. Which is ironic, considering the side of me that I rarely express; my ""cynical asshole syndrome"" would be able to easily kill any touts of ""look on the bright side!"" This is quite annoying-- all of my inner feelings are repressed, because I'm scared of losing my charisma, but I know that standing up for myself is vital for my general well-being. Think a gleeful Reese Witherspoon meets a hateful Ayn Rand-- that's what it's like (not trying to compare myself to the great Ayn Rand lol). The funny thing is, I always encourage everyone to include a grey area within their mindset, meanwhile, my thought pattern is more black & white than a Noir film. My OCD & Generalized Anxiety Disorder has worsened, as I have an intense panic attack every time I exit the house. I want to start doing fun activities again, but what's the point of doing so if I freak out whenever I'm exposed to the outside world? Oh, well. This all is OBVIOUSLY due to the inevitable phenomenon of growing up, as well. I still would have drastically changed as a person (not the exact way I have now), pandemic or no pandemic. I think it's all due to a variety of reasons. Maybe I'm just a self-centered idiot who is naive to the fact that this applies to everyone. Maybe I should just do my homework.

If it weren't for the fact that I'm 100% aware my intrusive thoughts/obsessions have no basis in reality, I'd think I were becoming psychotic. They're not things that are even possible. For instance, a few months ago, I got really into mental health TikTok and came across the idea of ""feeling your feelings"" and no emotion truly being ""negative."" This led my brain to latch onto this bizarre idea that maybe feeling bad is a good thing and doing things that make you feel good means you're just distracting yourself from your true negative feelings and thus doing fun things is bad. So now if a friend asks me to hang out or there's an event nearby that is something I would have been interested in a few months ago, my brain is like, ""Don't do the enjoyable thing, feeling good is actually bad."" And if I hear someone talking about their sadness, or hell even physical health problems, my brain is like, ""Why are they complaining about that? Feeling bad is a good thing."" I still react in a socially appropriate way, saying I'm so sorry you're going through that or whatever, but it *feels* wrong to react that way. 

I know it makes ZERO sense, literally no one experiences the world and emotions backwards like this, and it's not at all what therapists mean when they say to let yourself feel your true, authentic emotions. But now that the idea got into my mind, it won't leave. it makes it really hard to just interact with people and to live life at all. I don't know what to do to fix it other than just do my best to counteract it. 

For what it's worth, I asked my therapist if I could have OCD or psychosis, and he won't even entertain either idea.

I learned a lot in the recent years, know the symptoms, and I know how to confront the beast through CBT, ACT, ERP, tame it, contain it somewhat and I even know how and when to let it go again. 

As with many sufferers my OCD has certain themes that change overtime, always attaching itself to subjects that are important to me.

One theme that has been with me for years is that of decay and deterioration, specifically in and around the house. As a house owner there are the usual repairs and paintjobs to do, but my worries seem to go far beyond that. 

Worn carpets, discoloured floor planks, squeaky door hinges, rusty watertaps, wallpaper stains, bumpy matrasses, crooked toilet seats, flaky paint, faltering light switches, a leaking roof, loose skirting boards, an open window waiting for a gust of wind, they follow me around, occupy me, I can't seem to unsee them or forget about them.

I'm not being realistic obviously.

My wish to avoid the anxiety makes it difficult to deal with it. It paralyzes me and prevents me from fixing simple things that need fixing. Obviously, that is a dead end where more pain waits.

Sometimes I wish I lived in a rented house and simply call the landlord whenever something is wrong. Thing is, then it probably wouldn't bother me much since it wouldn't be my responsibility. Besides, my OCD would simply latch onto another subject, so I don't really believe in trying to outrun my OCD anyway.

Does anyone have a similar experience? There are many names for all the different types of OCD that people come up with, an infinite number of variations in thinkable obsessions, but what is this one called? I have read a lot about OCD, but I don't think I've ever heard of somebody else experiencing the same theme.

I found that my OCD themes typically center around the challenge of responsibility, whether it is as a home owner, a familyman or something expressed in self-control and behaviour, I recognize it as in essence being about the same thing, namely responsibility.

Back to the house, do you know what I'm talking about?",4,2022-03-22 07:22:15-04:00,"HOLY SHIT I live in the haunted house you're describing

and hearing you say it is making me realise the problem isn't in the house, it's in my thinking/emotional response to the house

like my crumbling house isn't the horror scape I'm making it out to be; it just feels so overwhelmingly that way ### I don‚Äôt know what that is called.. I‚Äôve had OCD like my whole life almost and I have had many themes too.. About this one I can say, I live in rented small house wanting to buy own one, but all tou just described stops me from doing it. I feel exhausted for even thinking about that then I‚Äôd have to do all the work and what if I don‚Äôt have the time, money or strenght or whatever so I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll burn out if I buy my own place

In your own it‚Äôs always like you have your freedom etc than in rented house but I have to say it is easier to live in rented.. But still I‚Äôd love to have my own place and call it home ### So my main type of OCD that I suffer from is called Just Right, and what you‚Äôre describing sounds a lot like what I go through. What OCD does in my experience is scan for any potential ‚Äúthreats‚Äù so I can feel ‚Äújust right‚Äù it‚Äôs like what you described with the growing list of things around the house. When it comes to the responsibility angle if I don‚Äôt have anything to do with it then I feel fine, but if I‚Äôm even in the presence then it feels like my OCD is telling me I must have absolute control to not even risk feeling ‚Äúnot right‚Äù another thing I do quite often is compare.

This is a very interesting topic, OP. ### Not the same thing you're experiencing, but as a homeowner I am constantly thinking about gas leaks, water damage, fires, my (admittedly very old) home collapsing on top of me and killing my whole family. As an HOCD/real event/false memory I person, I chalk it up to that same core fear of ""what if something bad happens and it's my fault/I could have prevented it/etc?"" ""Did I turn off the stove/lock the door/forget to let the dog inside? Ugh, I gotta go check."" Not to mention unplugging appliances before bed. It drives my partner crazy. ### ",16,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tk0pso/haunted_house_ocd_worn_carpets_discoloured_floor/
tkejcw,"help with rumination and life choices about having children TLDR; recovery suggestions and marriage advice

For context, I no longer want biological kids because I'm afraid my future child will inherit the health issues I have: a degenerative disc, hashimotos thyroiditis, burping disorder, and most importantly OCD. I didn't have any of these symptoms besides OCD and the burping (slight hiatal hernia, but probably a breathing disorder) until after we were married. The plan was always have 1 or 2 kids so obviously my wife is wrecked. But in the short term, how do you stop ruminations from wrecking your mood, consuming all your thoughts? We can't move past ""2nd base"" let alone actual ""relations"" even if I wear protection. Last night, after 2nd base, I happened to watch her wash her hands, then she went pee and my rumination is some still got on her hand and it surpassed toilet paper and her outer bits and impregnated her. My wife wants me to get back on antidepressants (tried Paxil, didn't help much) and asked if I could try meds again for 6 months before I get a vasectomy (which...is that the ultimate compulsion, or since my wife thinks kids will bring me misery), we probably aren't having biological children) though she's unsure if the vasectomy will finalize things and make her leave because her dream was always to be a mom. She loves me, but the resentment one of us will have for not getting what we want would also put a strain on our marriage. I don't want to make fear based decisions, but I also want to be able to think clearly enough to not lose my job from my intrusive thoughts causing debilitating depression keeping me in bed or a sad zombie.

So questions are: what was your treatment plan for ruminations, and if you ever had pregnancy obsessions, what helped push you in the right direction to conquer them?",1,2022-03-22 18:08:45-04:00,,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tkejcw/help_with_rumination_and_life_choices_about/
tkbhtq,"I‚Äôm actually worried I‚Äôm going crazy, I‚Äôm freaking out I‚Äôve had a rough week with anxiety and one day I realized it‚Äôs because I fear rejection/judgment and I feel like I need to be perfect. For some reason that made me feel worse the next day. That same day I heard my best friends friend make fun of somebodies stutter and he didn‚Äôt realize I have a stutter. I realized it‚Äôs so easy to talk badly behind peoples backs and that made me feel even worse. I started asking myself ‚Äúhow do I know who I can truly trust?‚Äù And I started asking myself if certain family members or coworkers would do this and if they devalued me as a person. As I was doing this I thought ‚ÄúI feel crazy‚Äù

A couple days passed and I realized anyone can make fun of anyone about anything, disability, sexuality, religion, appearance, etc. this made me calm and I started to go about my business and forget about this stuff. And then someone commented on a post I made about it and said they had a similar thought that lead to psychosis and paranoia. Psychosis is one of my biggest fears and as soon as I read that I was on the edge of a panic of attack and it took a good 30-60 minutes to get off of that edge. Ever since then my stomach has hurt and I‚Äôve been so anxious and now I can‚Äôt shake this thought. It went from ‚Äúwhat if others talk badly behind my back?‚Äù To ‚Äúwhat if I believe they talk badly behind my back?‚Äù

I know since I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll go crazy that‚Äôs a good sign, but since this thought wasn‚Äôt originally formed by OCD does that mean it‚Äôs the onset of psychosis?

Okay, so I have a deep dark secret. When I was 16, my grandfathers 3 month hospital stay would start to come to end. I would get the news that things weren‚Äôt looking good‚Ä¶ (I was not emotionally able to really process that news for years) but when i was told that, i had the quick thought that ‚Äúi hope my grandpa dies because then i‚Äôll know what it feels like to feel death.‚Äù 

I remember after the thought, i felt ashamed and disgusted with myself. i felt selfish and it really tainted every thought i had when it came to the funeral and his actual passing. all i could think the whole time is why would i wish for this? 

For years i never told anyone and it always came back to my mind and whenever i miss my grandfather i feel guilty because i basically wished for him to die? that one thought has been a great source of discomfort for 7 years now.

tk558z,"Suicide OCD Hello everyone! I am dealing with OCD for like 3 years and had several themes but this one seem to linger. I had an year of remission but I did a stupid thing and did some hard drugs and it put me into a depersonalization state with crazy anxiety that only Xanax took me out of it. I am hyper aware of my existence and it‚Äôs bothering me. I have an extremely happy life and I seriously don‚Äôt wanna die, but this hyper awareness is so strong it makes me feel ‚Äúbeing alive is uncomfortable‚Äù and ofc my mind finds ways to escape this feeling and goes straight to suicide. I also have stronger urges than i used to in the past. I am on the verge of throwing away all the knives in the house. Has anyone experienced this before and found some ways to get better?",12,2022-03-22 11:10:10-04:00,"When i was a child I faced this theme. Very dark days those were. Constantly waking up and fearing my own hands. My parents took me to a counselor. They considered hiding the knives but he warned them not too saying "" if you remove the knives it'll validate that fear"". Eventually it thankfully went away. I know that panic still to this day though it's a different theme. As much as it's difficult don't avoid what your afraid if (I can't say I've been good at doing this, it's hard), but instead engage with that thing in a positive way. For example, if your afraid of using knives to hurt yourself pick one up and use it to cut vegetables. These will show your mind that the knives is not a threat but a tool, and imthough it should be respected becuase it can cause damage it should not be feared. I hope this helps- as the other commentor wrote, go to therapy they can help you walk through this process and listen to uour concerns so you can get them our of your head. ### just admit that you're sick and need therapy. Assume this is due to OCD. We all feel trapped in our thoughts here, don't feel alone. But life goes on, and remember, with therapy you have a 100 percent chance of recovery. It doesn't good for you to give up while you still have this chance. You may feel bad today, but you will definitely be better tomorrow. my best bet to get rid of my OCD thoughts is to wait. I know that in time I will get rid of that thought. That's how ocd works, one thought goes, another comes. but for a thought that I know will go, I just wait, without thinking about it, I just wait. And remember, it's nice to be alive, to breathe. You have so much more to do, go to therapy, take your meds and then remembering these days say that I'm glad I didn't give up:) ### I'm going through this exact situation right now, mine started about 10 years ago after a therapist that wouldn't listen to me, pumped me full of medication I didn't need to be on. I had to ween off and it was all down hill from there. But recently I've had the suciadal obsession for some reason, but unlike you it's not to a specific thing like a knife. It's just a general feeling trapped kind of feeling. I also love my life and have many things going good for me that I'm looking forward to and I appreciate them. It's just those thoughts that give me bad anxiety then bring my mood down. I had a good bout with it last week where when that thought just came out of nowhere while driving to work I turned off my radio and welcomed those thoughts in and just drove into work the rest of the way in pure panic. It was horrible but the thoughts and anxiety went away pretty fast and didn't bother for the rest of the day.

What your therapist told your parents is so accurate and hit home. I remember i wanted to take all the knives away from my house. I am having a hard time using knives, but it got a bit better.

Hope you all the best friend! ü§ó ### thanks a lot for your comment, but I don‚Äôt think you understood what I meant. I am not suicidal, I love my life but I developed a form of existential ocd that makes me feel hyperaware of myself being ‚Äútrapped‚Äù in my body. I know it sounds weird for someone who never had it but it‚Äôs a symptom of depersonalization. It‚Äôs a feeling that makes me feel claustrophobic in my skin and it‚Äôs like i need to run away from myself which i know is impossible but it feeds my Suicide OCD. But i agree with you, the only way out for all forms of anxiety is to just accept the thoughts and move on. And regarding therapy, I did CBT therapy and i am on meds as well. I thought i was recovered, that‚Äôs why I no longer have therapy but i am just experiencing a relapse unfortunately üòì ### Omg i am so sorry you‚Äôre dealing with this for so long as well. It‚Äôs a terrible disorder. In my good times i was able to manage it pretty well to a point it was non existent but whenever i do something stupid, against my mental health like having some fun with alcohol, drugs etc it hits hard again. Now I learned my lesson and I am gonna stay away from these. I totally relate to the ‚Äútrapped‚Äù feeling i also have some sort of existential thoughts and makes the suicidal ocd much stronger. 

I am really glad you feel better and thanks a lot for taking your time to reply! I wish you all the best! ### Oh im sorry that you're dealing with that. I hope you'll be better soon.

tk81c3,"Recovering from abuse with OCD Hi everyone. My OCD is fairly severe, I constantly worry that I'm abusive and manipulative and that I disrespect and hurt the people around me. I worry that I have BPD or NPD. I have a CPTSD diagnosis, and I have experienced a lot of abuse in my life. 
My most recent ex may or may not have been abusive, but they very often pushed my boundaries, degraded me, and tried to manipulate me in a lot of different ways to get what they wanted. During the breakup, they told me about how I was so manipulative and gaslit them and all these other things. 
One of my worst compulsions is reassurance seeking, and I'm trying to avoid doing that here. So my question is knowing that these are the things I obsess over, and having someone trigger that obsession, how is it that I can take what they say into account without it driving me mad?

tjlixq,"OCD will twist everything against you and make you believe delusions that are not true. Don't give up. It will convince of literally anything. No matter how random the onset was, whether it started suddenly with nothing supporting your fears from the past.

It will twist every little past detail, minor current thing into making you believe it's true.

It will use your compulsions against you, and use it as proof. It will do anything.

Create false feelings to the point where you don't know what's what.

I struggled with intense sexual obsessions. I won't be graphic, it was a nightmare for over 4 months 24/7, but it was disgusting.

I had it for a while but it got a milliom times worse, essentially my compulsions were a bit different than most people's. Instead of doing anything to stop the thoughts (for me they were extremely graphic - visual, sound, everything), I would often make myself see what they'd come to. For what reason, I don't know, but then I'd check myself - do I like what I'm seeing/imagining? What sort of monstrosity my brain capable of creating? Etc etc.

Then I became obsessed with attraction to them. I'd imagine messed up scenarios to see if I'd get aroused and, surprise! I did. I then believed arousal meant attraction (it can but doesn't if you don't want it to).

It was a hellish nightmare. I stopped school, was in bed all the time, didn't even eat.

It got to the point I was terrified of seeing people (eg with pocd), I felt doomed, life ruined. It ruined my relationships. Everything.

I was convinced I'd enjoy acting out on them, that I'd enjoy it, because my OCD brain literally made me feel like I would.

It was only then did I realise, after so much torment, and everyone's words, that it was OCD.

Yeah, the arousal was unfortunate but I was a teenager so it was sadly bound to happen. But everything else? I literally cried after reading an emotional story. Or when others feel upset. 

Why did I cry so many times because OCD literally made me doubt myself so much I believed I'd enjoy murdering people or raping others or going against God or other upsetting things? Really OCD? Because it's so against who I am.

I had an epiphany moment. If I actually enjoyed those things and everything, would I be on medication, with a stop in my life, crying all the time, if it were true? Of course not.

I'm sort of free from the cycle and feel a million times better. After realising, I'm not all that, I felt so much relief. 

I know it sounds monstrous, I guarantee you I felt like the worst monster ever when I was in my worst episode. But everyone - psychiatrists, my family, everyone - kept telling me it's not true. I've always been a sensitive and empathetic person. I showed no signs of anything bad ever. 

I found out OCD can literally make you feel feelings. You can feel like you like the thoughts and ideas even though you're panicking about it. It will do EVERYTHING. Use any little minor detail against you and twist it.

Don't let it get to you!!! You're not like that. If your fears were true - if you were truly ehat your obsession is about, your life wouldn't be affected! You'd like it! It would make you feel complete and happy! You wouldn't even question obsessively or anything. I feel ecstatic thinking about miraculous, or Minecraft, or this or that, I never once have doubting thoughts and anxious obsessions, testing, checking, anything. It makes me happy and I look forward to it. My obsessions made me depressed and hate life.

You can do this. Don't let OCD win. I was triggered a lot when I read comments say - if your thoughts don't disturb you, or you dwell on them, or this or that, it's not OCD. That is not true. If it bothers you, if you don't like it, if it makes you upset and unhappy, it's OCD.

Don't believe otherwise. OCD is a manipulative monster. You're not alone. It gets better. OCD will use all tactics to depress you and bring you down. But it's a liar.",10,2022-03-21 16:43:26-04:00,"Gosh the way it makes things feel so real is the most insidious part. You said it best, it‚Äôs super manipulative.

tkcjrc,"Ocd and extreme jealousy? I‚Äôm (20F) having a hard time Does anyone else experience extreme jealousy in their relationship related to OCD? I‚Äôm 20 and a female. I am currently in therapy but nothing is helping me. This is my third relationship and this obssesive thoughts have only gotten worse. 

I have obsessive thoughts about my partner cheating on me or my partner flirting with other women. It has been getting worse, i used to be jealous when he went out partying with friends, now the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhim going to university and talking to other pretty girls is intolerable. He recently started and I cry every day thinking that he is going to talk to other women, look at other women, that they are going to seem more attractive to him, more interesting. I think that he is going to leave me or that he is going to meet better women and flirt with them. I don‚Äôt think he will actually be unfaithful to me, because I trust him in some way, but I‚Äôm obsessed with the fact that other women seem attractive to him and he can talk to them or make friends with them.  

Has anyone gone through something similar and have any advice? I am suffering a lot and i have a lot of anxiety, he is a good guy for what he has shown me and I would not want to end the relationship without a good reason, although my ocd tells me that I have to leave him before he can hurt me, every day.

tk4ewj,"just heard i might have OCD, still shook. Haii, so i currently have some quite heavy therapy about stuff in my past. I currently have the diagnosis autism, and it's clear that i might have ADD and that i have had dysthymia. (Light longterm depression.)
So then my therapist came with this. 
He had been asking me questions about my intrusive thoughts, and then he said 'i think you have OCD' 
so now we're here! (Internal screaming added) 

I do believe that, because i took risperidon, an heavy antipsychotic, as a child for so long, 5 years i believe. 
That because of that medicine that i took to take away my stress, that my OCD never came to full fruition... until 2020. 
I personally do not have any needs to control situations by tapping, as i have the luck that i learned myself distraction early one. (But i should sit more with my anxiety, let's be honest.) 

Anyhow.. now we're here. 
And i was wondering if anyone else has had a similair situation, where they once heard that they could have OCD? 

(I believe everyone here has such a moment though, but worth asking.) 



Thank you for reading until here, i know this is a bit of a rant, so thank you for reading it. 
I hope you have an absolutely lovely day!!",4,2022-03-22 10:36:36-04:00,"Maybe it's because of your existing diagnoses, but you very much seem to be in the right mindset to take on OCD! For what it's worth, autism, ADHD, and OCD have a pretty high comorbidity rate, as do OCD and any form of depression (when I was in residential treatment for OCD, they basically just *assumed* we all had depression, that's how likely it is). So if you find yourself feeling like you've just got *so many* diagnoses (which, same), keep in mind that they like to travel in packs.

I'm not sure how familiar you are with OCD, but word of advice: You'll see a lot of discussion about themes. Themes are clusters of related symptoms. For example, if someone has contamination OCD, either a lot of their time is spent on contamination obsessions and compulsions, or they have a long list of them, or they're the most intense/difficult ones. *But* very few of us *only* have symptoms that fit into our top themes. Based on my discussions with people in residential (which, admittedly, is limited to people with severe OCD), most of us have at least one or two things in almost every category. I've seen people worry there was something wrong with them for not neatly fitting into the themes, so I figure I'd give you that heads up from the start.

It's tough, but ERP (as unpleasant as it is) really does work wonders. Best of luck! ### I can relate as it was recently mentioned to me as well. I hate the thoughts and doubts and fears it being mentioned conjures up especially because now I‚Äôm analyzing everything I‚Äôve ever done in my life like ‚Äúwas that just me being ocd?‚Äù And ‚Äúwas that not normal?‚Äù or even ‚Äúis my research on it now a normal level or am I obsessing over it?‚Äù‚Ä¶ All the things I had been avoiding (just not making decisions about it etc) and putting in the back of my brain for a while just came flying up front‚Ä¶ ### Thank you so so much! This comment means a lot, thank you! 

And yes, i was actually an autism activist for a bit and did a paper on it, so i do know that LGBTQ+, OCD, ADHD, Depression, ASD and sometimes borderline or bipolar to freshen up the mix, tends to be a very popular package. It's just right now that mess of having bad representation of the disorder, the first time ever i get to realize that i might actually have something without self diagnosis, so even more shock, and then also the chaos of me not having any symptoms that were obvious, until the last two years, due to me not having taken risperidon for 3/4 years now. 

It's so odd. Somehow, due to me taking risperidon for my stress, the intrusive thoughts visited a lot later. Like they were there, just once a week basically. Where now it can be up to 6 times a day. 
So it's just very much, wait.. WHAT??? (Insert bdg meme here) 
Anyhow, thank you once more. <33 first time ever i'm actually new to this kinda stuff, as my special interest is basically behavioural disorders. So this means a LOT!! <3 ### Yes exactly!

tjzfwv,"Intrusive thoughts every day I don‚Äôt know if I have ocd but every day I have these annoying intrusive thoughts about taking my own life or dying because I‚Äôm scared of myself because of trauma due to intrusive thoughts and other experiences.

when I think about something bad that happened in the past I get this thought that I want to take my own life and have this urge as well and emotions and that‚Äôs what scares me. 

I‚Äôve actually tried not to react and let the feeling pass and it worked but then I‚Äôll wake up and I‚Äôll have that fear again the next day.

Do you think I should just not react and let them pass I find that when I‚Äôm busy it helps but I still have that fear when I‚Äôm trying to concentrate on something.",8,2022-03-22 05:56:47-04:00,"My ocd latches onto my fears and uses them against me in every way possible. I hope it gets better for you. I saw someone post something on here that was very helpful for me. 

It goes something like this. Imagine you're walking on a busy street and you're walking by a newspaper stand and the headlines are your intrusive thoughts. The sales man is calling out to you to stop and look but you don't. You just keep walking. ### back in 2020 , I went through this for about one and a half month , and at that time I didnt know about ocd at all ,and I would have the worst time of my life , even on my birthday that i used to be so excited for , became less enjoyable and I had such thouhts even that day.

I used to go down a spiral of what is the meaning of life and I couldnt find any , and so I would think its better to leave . And for a whole month I would have sudden thoughts like TW >!(jumping off , or harming myself etc) !<. I tried ignoring them , but the more I tried the more they latched on . Days passed and then I really started thinking about it in a less anxious manner and I concluded a simple fact i.e Without being alive or being here you wouldnt even know that soemthing like this exists and have such connections and belong stuff like that . This is like the only chance knowing soemthing exists. 

So everytime such thoughts would come I would tell myself ur just spiralling and you know that by staying on you know this exists. 

I dont know if it helped you . ### Let it go, do not react, mindfulness, observe don't absorb. From my experience, the only way how to beat this shit up is stop to fight with that. Try do some research on ""pure OCD"".   


Stay strong! üêª ### Thanks for this, it actually is a really nice comparison! ### I hope it gets better for you too :) and that is a good way of looking at it. ### It kind of helped thanks I just have this fear aswell that I think these thoughts might manifest.

tk2rj1,"I feel broken. All I want is to ‚Äúbe normal‚Äù I‚Äôm convinced on earth all I am is a victim to every situation and every person in my life. Ive dealt with ocd all my life, on top of that ptsd. I don‚Äôt know what to do. Please help. I‚Äôm scared. And I‚Äôm tired. I‚Äôm exhausted from living, I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm convinced I can‚Äôt trust anyone and I‚Äôm convinced the world is just a traumatizing place and I hate that I‚Äôm alive and part of it. I don‚Äôt know whats wrong with me it seems like there‚Äôs so much wrong with me I shouldn‚Äôt even be alive. My mom had ocd, so does her mom and it just keeps going back. She‚Äôs superstitious and the thoughts she has are scary. When I was a child I had so many health issues and everyone thought I had autism and was troubled because of the meltdowns I‚Äôd have over certain thoughts and tidiness. I only later in my teens realized it was ocd all along. My mom throughout my childhood id overhear her theories and she has always been secretly convinced I‚Äôm not supposed to exist. That I‚Äôm a curse on the family and was supposed to die when I got sick with an autoimmune disease and God was trying to do my family a favor by taking me out of their lives. 


I don‚Äôt believe my mom is very religious but she‚Äôs a victim of my father‚Äôs abuse and manipulation just as I am. My dad is extremely religious I‚Äôve never heard him teach about God‚Äôs love or anything like that. Just sin and how I‚Äôm unworthy of love or blessings, that I was born in sin, I deserve to go to hell and only through Christ will I be well. He told me I only exist to please God, and men. Since I was 3 he‚Äôd do daily devotional with me all regarding purity culture, the sacredness of a women‚Äôs virginity and how if I don‚Äôt save it for my husband I‚Äôm shameful to God and whoever I love. It was too much for me to comprehend before I even knew about sex and all of it just messed me up and put so much anxiety in me. I knew from a young age men could be weird and take advantage of women. My mom would frequently read the horror stories for hours and share them with us. All of it‚Äôs been embedded in my mind. They‚Äôre both narcissists they‚Äôve abused me so much physically and emotionally they tore me apart and I‚Äôve had suicidal thoughts since I was 8 years old. 

My ocd started coming to play once the abuse got worse. Between my mom hitting me till I‚Äôd pass out and my father finding any excuse to spank me I‚Äôd take it out on having to make everything else in my life perfect. I‚Äôd stay up late worrying about all kinds of things, I was obsessed with my room being in a perfect order but it was never perfect enough so I couldn‚Äôt sleep alone till I was 12 and had to sleep with my little sister or grandma. I was just always so terrified of everything and all the time I‚Äôd hear my parents yelling saying I‚Äôm not normal and why can‚Äôt I be normal. My biggest regret in life is not killing myself the moment I started feeling those things it would have saved me from so much trouble. 

I developed an autoimmune disease soon after I started having so many ocd thoughts and the abuse got worse than it ever did. My parents always yelled it‚Äôs all they ever did for hours and hours telling me I‚Äôm evil telling me i should have never been born i didn‚Äôt want to endure that and get in trouble because they yelled at my sister when she had symptoms of my same illness. So when I started getting sick I kept it a secret. I was 11 and I only weighed 49 pounds. I‚Äôd go to school and act like everything‚Äôs okay id do all my homework and extra curricular and toughen up knowing I was probably dying. I was pale and frail and everyone at school worried for me but my parents saw no difference they‚Äôd keep hitting me keep yelling at me and I just had to endure it. At my doctors appointment everything was brought to light and from that day on my parents just hate me even more. They tell me I‚Äôm an abuser and I abuse them because I lie. They said I didn‚Äôt tell them I was a sick which proves their theory that I‚Äôm an evil liar sent by the devil to destroy them. I‚Äôm 18 now they still say this stuff. When I was harassed by others they bring it up say it‚Äôs my fault because I don‚Äôt tell them things and I‚Äôm naturally a liar. 

But I‚Äôm not a liar at least I don‚Äôt think I am I just feel scared of everything. They stopped hitting me once I had a diagnosis but the emotional abuse continued. When I was really sick they‚Äôd be kind and loving and I‚Äôd feel myself revert back to being a small child I‚Äôd act so young because I wanted to make up for all the love I lost. Then I‚Äôd start to get better I‚Äôd finally be able to leave the hospital and leave my bed and walk around like a normal kid and all the abuse would start again it didn‚Äôt make sense to me. I finally got the courage to call for help and it was the worst mistake of my life. They held me hostage they pulled me out of school they took away all access to technology and books including wifi I wasn‚Äôt allowed to leave my house ever without permission I can‚Äôt even remember what I did for that year I just stared blankly at a wall. 

Throughout the years I was sick my father became very invested in Christianity. Even when I was as frail and sick as I was to the point where I could hardly ever leave my bed or the bathroom he‚Äôd take me to large conventions and churches it was so scary. Everyone was yelling and putting their hands on me to pray. The sessions would last 7 hours and I‚Äôd have to tolerate all of it. Idk how I got through it all I wouldn‚Äôt be able to go through it today. 

I just want my childhood back I wish I was never born I wish none of this ever happened to me I wish I didn‚Äôt have to live knowing how traumatizing my life is. As soon as I was able to go back to school and make friends and talk to other people I realized how abused I had been and everything bad that‚Äôs happened but it was too difficult for me to reflect on. I‚Äôd just never come home I‚Äôd stay out late at night with friends I‚Äôd only come home to sleep. 

I got my first boyfriend when I was 16 and I was so so so careful. I knew what abuse looked like I knew how bad I was treated by my parents so I‚Äôve always been so careful with who I pick in partners and it‚Äôs why I never dated or even kissed anybody until I found someone I trusted. We took things so slow and I don‚Äôt know what happened. There was so much I hadn‚Äôt been awoken to and realized that my parents did but I already had so many sexual anxieties rising times the surface I just thought I could overcome them so I could be happy and live the life I wanted. My boyfriend and I started being sexual and the anxieties just overcame me after. I could keep them under control and I communicated I wanted to take a step back and he respected that but a couple months later the pandemic happened and it just it killed me it killed my spirit I haven‚Äôt felt alive since. 

Idk what happened it‚Äôs scary to even think about it felt like when I got in trouble for falling cps. Both my parents are also high risk so they were scared and paranoid they did doomsday prep and I didn‚Äôt I couldn‚Äôt I couldn‚Äôt leave my house for over a year. I couldn‚Äôt go on walks. I couldn‚Äôt go on the porch. I couldn‚Äôt even go get my mail. I couldn‚Äôt open a fucking window. I had to be stuck in my room the whole time like a prisoner. If I left my room I‚Äôd hear yelling and screaming so I just stayed locked in my room and after a month my anxieties got out of control my only access to the outside world was social media and it was flooded with SA stories because it was SA awareness month and i started remembering all my friends stories on experiencing that and I internalized all of it and started fixating on the idea that what if all my anxieties and guilt isn‚Äôt caused by sexual shame and religious purity culture guilt but the fact he hurt me. 

I was so scared I couldn‚Äôt ignore it I didn‚Äôt know it was ocd so I kept replaying every moment I kept debating I kept fixating. I couldn‚Äôt talk to my friends and i would just stay in my room terrified. My boyfriend knew something was wrong but I couldn‚Äôt tell him I was too scared. He‚Äôd stay on the phone with me every day trying to cheer me up but I was fixating on him I was scared. A few months passed and my friend suggested I play online games to get a hobby and we met someone dangerous on one of them who found my social media and started creating pages photoshopping me onto nude bodies and spreading a rumor that I was not who I say I am and a pedophilic 27 year old. I was so scared because I have experience with social media harassment and I remembered how anxious that made me feel. I always knew I wanted to escape my parents and since I didn‚Äôt have enough freedom to get a job and my health wasn‚Äôt good enough to be involved in school I became a social media influencer creating an image and working with companies it was the most depressive exploiting thing a kid could do but I subjected myself to it with the hopes I could be free and escape. This could have ruined so much for me even though it was totally false I knew I had nothing to worry about but my anxiety was so high. I told my boyfriend who had experience with this stuff and knows a lot about technology and he did everything he could to help me and even got in touch with a family member who works for the fbi. He could have helped me but I kept repeating that my parents think I‚Äôm a liar and I have to tell them so late at night when my boyfriend wasn‚Äôt picking up my calls I panicked and I told my parents. My dad started yelling at me he called me a slut and said this is all my fault because I sinned and have a boyfriend even though that has nothing to do with anything he told my mom and told her my sex tape was leaked even though that was nothing like what happened but he said that to make her more angry with me everyone was screaming and surrounding me I‚Äôve never been more scared in my life I felt like I was going to die it lasted 13 hours I didn‚Äôt know where to run my mom changed all the locks on the house and the security system doesn‚Äôt let anyone leave without a password only she knew I could only hide under my bed and they were both surrounding me and yelling and I had a panic attack and passed out.  My boyfriend was on the phone through all of it. I was so scared they were going to hurt me again and I felt so helpless and so did my boyfriend knowing there was nothing he could do. The issue with the harrasser subsided but I was never able to talk to my dad again and it‚Äôs been over a year now. I feel like I‚Äôll pass out if I‚Äôm even near him or see him 

Ever since then I started being very sensitive to sound I had a therapist for a little while after that incident I had begged for one since I was sick but my parents refused bcuz they knew if I had one their abuse would come to light. They finally let me have one but said it had to be a specialized Christian one. She was racist and I‚Äôm half Asian and she‚Äôs frequent say awful things to me but I knew she was all I had so I had to stick by her. Since my fixation was regarding sex I couldn‚Äôt bring it up because of purity culture and how she‚Äôd tell me I sinned. I just kept suffering in silence but she let me know it seemed I was suffering from ptsd. 

I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me or what‚Äôs going on. It‚Äôs been years now and I‚Äôve become a hermit. I‚Äôm not in school. I don‚Äôt have a job. If I ever leave my house I have panic attacks. I‚Äôm confused I don‚Äôt understand life I don‚Äôt understand myself I feel like I‚Äôve been the victim in so many situations and I have to piece it all together to make  it make sense but nothing makes sense. I don‚Äôt know who‚Äôs the enemy I don‚Äôt know why life is like this. I don‚Äôt understand why I suffer from so much anxiety regarding my physical safety and harassment I don‚Äôt know where it stems from. I was always so shy and scared of things because of how much my parents yelled at me and lectured me for every little thing so at school since I was small I was the easiest target. Boys would touch me, I remember one time a boy kept touching my bottom so I went him on told my dad and he applauded me for speaking up and took care of the situation and reminded me with a scary lecture that that‚Äôs wrong and nobody can touch me like that but my husband but than a few days later I dropped a glass and he insisted I have to be spanked on my bare ass while I lay across his lap. That confused me so much and I didn‚Äôt even realize it until my boyfriend started touching me. I don‚Äôt understand I don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs wrong with. I tried so hard to escape all of this I tried so hard I would have been able to escape them if it wasn‚Äôt for me getting sick. I tried everything I could to make money online I built a brand I built a stupid fucking image and it was so stupid. None of it amounted to anything. I exploited myself and got myself in so many dangerous situations. I tried so hard to make money through a screen that I encountered so many creeps who wanted to take advantage of me and did. So many people who wouldn‚Äôt leave me alone and harassed me all because I needed a way out and I never got a way out. I‚Äôm still stuck in the same place fixated on everything and all I ever think about are all the times I‚Äôve been hurt by people outside of my parents. 

That‚Äôs all I can ever think about. The street harassment. School harassment, online harassment and the possibility my boyfriend assaulted me. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me and what made me like this because there‚Äôs too much and everytime I catch myself thinking about my parents I hear their terrible voices spitting in my face and telling my I‚Äôm the devil that I blame them for everything because I‚Äôm a coward who can‚Äôt take responsibility. I want help. I‚Äôve been begging for help since I was a kid and I can‚Äôt get any. I‚Äôm 18 now I can‚Äôt get a job I‚Äôm not in school I hardly have any friends I‚Äôm all alone. I can‚Äôt leave my house and I can‚Äôt get help because I‚Äôm under my parents insurance and still need their approval and since I have certain documents and health issues they have the right to see all my diagnosis and treatment. There‚Äôs no way for me to get help or relief and I‚Äôve felt dead for 2 years now. There hasn‚Äôt been a signal moment of relief and all I want to do is die because there‚Äôs no way to make sense of what I‚Äôve been through. Everybody wants to hurt me. Everybody wants to take advantage of me and people say I‚Äôm paranoid and I‚Äôm distressed but that‚Äôs not true.

tk1hok,"There is hope !! (Schizophrenia/ psychosis OCD) 
For months I‚Äôve been dealing with this crippling theme every minute of everyday. I put my entire life on hold and stayed at home just waiting for the moment I would slip into psychosis or start hallucinating, I would put safety plans in place telling my family to take me to hospital straight away if I became delusion or I‚Äôd beg different therapists and my doctor for answers. Everything I was experiencing was put down as anxiety and OCD but of course I couldn‚Äôt accept it. 

I experienced terrible terrible symptoms of this theme which made me afraid, self conscious and horrible. I gave up work, college and stopped meeting my friends and removed myself away from family because I was so scared of myself. I felt like my therapist wasn‚Äôt listening to me or maybe I wasn‚Äôt telling him the right symptoms and he just couldn‚Äôt see that I was in a psychosis. 

I finally told myself to shut up and to get motivated. I literally hit rock bottom and sat at home feeling sorry for myself scrolling through social media seeing other people going out living their lives. 

I began taking my medication as a main priority (50mg sertraline). I really listened to my therapist and I‚Äôve been trying to trust him. I got a new job to keep me distracted, of course I do get stressed at work which does make me anxious as I‚Äôm still going through this theme but I know it‚Äôs just OCD and anxiety trying to drag me back to my bed and hideaway from the world. I‚Äôm finally meeting my friends again, I‚Äôm starting to drive and I got accepted into a beauty pageant for my country. 

I also am looking at schizophrenia and psychosis in a different way, as people who have these illnesses can live a normal life too and having these illnesses is NOT a death wish. 

What I‚Äôm trying to get across here is that there is hope. I was so sure I was never going to get out of this hole but I am, I‚Äôm doing it. I still deal with this theme but I‚Äôm managing it slowly. I have good and bad days and that‚Äôs okay because that‚Äôs what my recovery road looks like. If anyone is struggling with this theme please be patient with yourself but also use what your going through as motivation to get through this because if I can do it you guys definitely can too.

Totally! Will say, I have psychosis and almost every single friend I have and person I spend time with regularly has psychosis or is schizophrenic and we are all really cool. I live a pretty normal life given everything and don‚Äôt feel that being psychotic is really a big detractor in my quality of life and I would rank dealing with it (fully unmedicated) much lower on my list of disorder I have that impact my qualify of life than I would OCD. It‚Äôs much more stressful.

Obviously YMMV but, that‚Äôs my personal experience as someone with psychosis who talks to a lot of other psychotic people and a lot of schizophrenics. ### Thank you for posting this, there is hope for us at the end of this tunnel.

tk87e3,"How much is too much OCD? I‚Äôm meeting my therapist on Friday after meeting him two weeks ago. I have slipped so damn hard since that time with crying, intrusive thoughts, reverting back to sleeping with my childhood stuffed animal, and just all around lack of happiness and calmness within myself

But I‚Äôm afraid to talk it out with him. Our meetings so far have just been a catch up really and that‚Äôs it. I want to talk to him about how messed up my thoughts are, how I am gay, how i am not happy. But every-time he asks these questions I choke up and shrug it off. 

Another factor to note is that I am Jewish. As is with many religions, sexuality is a huge unknown. Being gay in the Jewish religion isn‚Äôt the sin it‚Äôs acting upon it (I.e. gay sex). My therapist is also Jewish. I know it is so damn stupid to not tell him out of religious ‚Äúpersecution‚Äù but that‚Äôs my fear. 

I also can‚Äôt talk to my parents about this because last time I brought up mental health to them it totally went over swimmingly (if ya can‚Äôt tell that is sarcasm over there) 

So I‚Äôm in a pickle (I think)

Do I continue my sessions just shrugging off help or do I end it and live a life where I constantly feel the need to melt and whither away from this existence I have learned to call life?

Today I don't do anything that is even close to cheating even if it is a legit game feature that was put in the game by the devs to be used by players I still don't use it. Also, I would just tell myself it is cheating and then get off and delete the world or save. Also when my friend gets on the video game without me knowing I have to tell them to get off the game and then get back on I don't know why it's just a weird impulse in me and for certain games, Stardew Valley, Ark Survival Evolved etc. Any story game or co-op game I can't get on it first I have look at their profile to wait to see when they get on and then I will get on immediately but for games like Call of Duty Warzone I don't have to wait I just get on.

The way forward is basically the same as all other kinds of OCD.  Exposure and sitting with the anxiety it creates.  For video games that means creating the character or game you want and sticking with it regardless of what your compulsions say.  In your case you‚Äôll also have to get used to disregarding your friends status in the game and not telling them to get off.

It sucks, and the anxiety will suck too.  But if you can learn to disregard it, it will pass and the compulsions should diminish with time. ### Thanks. ### ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tka7ya/tips_on_overcoming_ocd_in_video_games/

 2 years ago I made a post here asking if you have named your OCD(and if you feel comfortable with sharing I'd still love to hear your OCD names).

 Today my therapist asked from me that how I'd like to title my thoughts. Like newspaper title or something like that. She said that many people use something like ""shitty news"" or ""shitty thoughts"". My brain could not make any names for that doe. What title would you use for your own thoughts? Maybe I could take some inspiration from your titles when creating my own.

I find it much easier to talk about ‚ÄòIggy‚Äô than to say I‚Äôm having intrusive thoughts. I‚Äôve even created a character and an appearance for Iggy. He‚Äôs a writhing shadowy mass that can shape shift, although he usually appears in a humanoid form with two horns and a little top-hat. Every time he wins, he gets bigger.

tkf1gy,"Sexual False Memory OCD TW TW


I have struggled for a handful of years with this particular thought that one day in high school I raped a younger girl and have zero way of having 100% assurance. I know the OCD cycle and reassurance seeking is a trap, but how am I suppose to overcome this thought? False memory ocd warps your mind and entangles you in absurd lies. 

My biggest fear is that I‚Äôll hit a rough point, lose my control, and confess to something I didn‚Äôt do. (There‚Äôs even doubt in my mind while I type this) It petrifies me.",1,2022-03-22 18:31:58-04:00,"Exposuuuuure

What if you did do it? How many years ago was that? Have you raped anyone since? If not, then even if you *did* rape someone in high school, you've gone however-many years without incident. Sure, what you did was very very bad, but you seem to have realized this and committed to not doing it again. You clearly feel bad about it, so that's something, right? 

But now the question becomes, should you confess? What is the purpose of confessing? It's to try to set things right, yes? There are two people here, you and the girl. If you did rape her, and you confess, they're probably going to want to talk to her, which is going to bring up trauma, and considering she didn't report it, she probably doesn't want to deal with all that. So how about you? You might go to jail. And maybe you deserve that, you did rape someone after all. *But* what is the purpose of sending a rapist to jail? It's supposed to punish them for their crime, and deter them from doing it again. You're already punishing yourself by agonizing about it, and you've already committed to never doing it again. So those purposes are already served. All going to jail will do is let you wallow in self-pity about how you're a terrible person who deserves punishment. That doesn't do that girl any good, and the real victim here is her, not you, so don't make it about you. No matter how much you might want to (and as much as she probably does as well), you can't undo it. Just...don't do it again. That's all you can do, really.

End exposure

There is a bit of nuance here between OCD thoughts and if you *actually* did it, mainly as it relates to her. If you had genuinely assaulted this woman and regretted it, I would say that another thing you need to do is leave her the fuck alone, whereas with OCD, you should probably, say, go up and say hi if you run into her at the store, to trigger and lean into the feelings. And if you really did do it, there's a whole debate that could be had about the specific ethics of confessing or not, including things like how long it's been, but since it's OCD, *do not go down that rabbit hole*. The framework I included in the exposure is fine. Even if you actually did do it, it's a reasonable conclusion to draw, just not one everyone would agree on, so just resist any urge to mentally debate it. Your goal vs your OCD is to keep yourself from confessing to something you didn't do, so you need an exposure that says yes, you did do it, *and* it is morally okay to not turn yourself in. Feel free to *add* reasons why you genuinely believe it is okay not to do so, but don't analyze the issue or entertain any ideas why you *should* confess. That's your OCD talking.

I suggest making a script like what I wrote, in first person. Read it over again, pausing to sit with the anxiety any time it increases. Repeat daily. You'll most likely feel urges to punish yourself, either in obvious ways or internal self-criticism. Those are compulsions. Recognize that *even if you did do it*, no amount of punishing yourself can undo it, nor do they help the girl in any way or make you a better person. It's just a way of trying to make yourself feel better that won't actually work anyway.

I hope that helps. ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tkf1gy/sexual_false_memory_ocd/

tk1szy,"Being bad beyond Real Event OCD  Hello everyone,   


I don't know how to put this into words because it really makes me feel really bad.   


I've had many different OCD issues, and I'm currently experiencing some of these issues as well. One of the most difficult topics for me is Real Event OCD.   


Since last Sunday, I have been constantly having obsessions and compulsions which I cannot resist.   


On Sunday I went to the supermarket with my 3-year-old son, when we were done and in the car I forgot one thing. The car is literally 20 seconds walk from the service counter, I then walked to the service counter on my own, there was no queue, and I bought an item there. Then I walked back 20 seconds again and I've been away from my son who was in the infant seat for no more than 60-90 seconds. Nothing crazy had happened, and we then drove back home (it was a maximum of 9 degrees outside that day, so he hasn't been in a warm car or something like that).   


That afternoon we went on the road again, and on the way home I found out that what I had bought at the service desk was not enough, I parked the car at another 20 seconds walk from the service desk, then I bought the same product again, only there was a little delay because the cashier could not log in. I was away from the car for a maximum of 2 minutes (120 seconds). On my way back I noticed that the car alarm had gone off, this is because my son was probably touching or moving inside the car, and it was detected as a break-in. When I arrived, he was in tears, I quickly turned off the alarm and comforted him. I immediately felt very guilty, and then it occurred to me that it was a small effort to take him with me.   


I've never done this before, but I can't forgive myself for doing it anyway 2 times in a row on the same day!. I've been googling continuously since Sunday, and find all kinds of reports of children dead in cars due to overheating and other accidents. Now I feel terrible because I didn't pay attention to the alarm in the first place (in the past the alarm also went off when my wife was left in the car, so I should have known that it could happen again). And that I put my son in danger of suffocation or something like that. Even if it was only 1-2 minutes max.  


I now read all the time about parents whose child has died etc. I have no idea how I can ever forgive myself! I really do feel like a monster, and I am now also hugely overcompensating to my son. He doesn't seem to be bothered by it at all, he doesn't talk about it or anything. But all the time I see images of him sitting dead in his chair or something like that.  


I often see on reddit that a lot of people have Real Event OCD about certain events, but they aren't nearly as bad as this one, I've googled how to report myself to the police, but my wife doesn't want that, because that would wake sleeping dogs, because she thinks there is little going on, and she doesn't want our children to be supervised. By the way, I plan to go back to the supermarket this afternoon and clock on my phone how long it took me to be gone. I then go for the exact route, and buy the same product and do it all at a leisurely pace so that at least I don't have less time on my stopwatch than it actually was. I also don't understand how I could have come up with this, I am usually extremely careful and protective of my children.   


How can I be so stupid?",7,2022-03-22 08:25:13-04:00,"It definitely seems like confessing by turning yourself into police, and checking to go to the store alone and ""time"" how long it take to reassure yourself it was only two minutes. ### If you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please do not hesitate to talk to someone.

Are you in any kind of therapy? ### Definitely don't report yourself to the police *or* go back to the store and time yourself. Those are compulsions, and they will not help. I'm pretty sure reporting yourself to the police is a way of punishing yourself, in which case, know that if they respond in any way other than dismissing you, it will convince you that you deserve to be punished, and if they dismiss you, it'll convince you that you're a terrible person who's convinced them you aren't as bad as you actually are.

This may technically count as reassurance, I'm not entirely sure. But when I was a kid, leaving your kid in the car for a short time was pretty common. I couldn't even begin to tell you how many times I sat in the car by myself for 5 minutes while my parents ran in and grabbed something really quick. 

Most things aren't *inherently* safe or dangerous. Whether you take your kid into the store with you or leave them in the car, it's possible nothing bad will happen to them, and it's possible something will. Maybe the odds are different; for all I know, they actually aren't, we've just decided one is a bad idea because it sounds like it. Does that mean you should just start leaving him in the car all the time? Of course not, and you're not going to. But it isn't *directly* harmful, just (maybe) slightly higher risk, as long as it isn't hot out, and you already said you wouldn't have done it if it was. So.

The OCD part is the same as it always is. Some self-compassion exercises might be helpful in giving yourself permission to not beat yourself up as much. Just try not to use them to facilitate the OCD. ### I've seen my therapist just now, The conclusion of our meeting has been that I'm just not responsive to CBT / ERP etc. This really hit me hard. He has been the one of so many OCD specialists in my country I have been to, and everywhere I'm getting the feedback that things just don't work that well for me (therapy wise).  
  
I've been going to several OCD specialists over the course of 8 years now with minimal to zero effect, I've been on different medications, and have applied for deep brain stimulation. The DBS has a long waiting queue and even then chances are very slim ill be allowed to get DBS.  
  
My therapist told me that even if we would have a 100 sessions per week, things just don't change for me... it's very demotivating for me. In the past I've been into closed facilities for OCD, and intense therapy for 12 weeks 5 days a week for special OCD programs.... with minimal effect. ### I'm sorry to hear that. It does sound demoralizing to hear that from a therapist. I still think it's worth trying to treat, as its clearly distressing you. Does he have any helpful suggestions for you? Maybe another kind of therapy or therapist can help.

From what I've read, you seem like you care a lot. You're just suffering from OCD. ### Question. Did you develop OCD after an illness? There's a condition called Basal Ganglia Encephalitis (BGE), often called PANDAS when it occurs in childhood, where after an infection a person develops a range of symptoms including OCD.

I ask because OCD caused by BGE tends to be far less responsive to standard treatment. If you've been doing that much for that long with no response, that *might* be an indication of something else going on.

I really hope you find something that helps. ### ",5,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tk1szy/being_bad_beyond_real_event_ocd/

I know this is irrational but even so it still impacts I'm life- and I dint get help for it because I can see it's irrational. This feat makes me act awkwardly around others so that I block off any ability I have to act on these intrusive thoughts. However, this only amplifies the issue because it's off putting to those I'm around, they start questioning/working about me because I'm guarded and this only feeds into the thoughts- now not only do I fear that id hurt them, but the threats been validated.

Hours on end I‚Äôm conversing with my inner self, my OCD. It talks back, and it says the worst outcomes will come to pass and you live with that anxiety and fear.

tk79i9,"Am I going crazy? So I have a stutter and I‚Äôve always been insecure about it. I was with my best friend and his friend and his friend made fun of someone‚Äôs stutter because he‚Äôs not aware I stutter. This made me realize how easy it is to make fun of people behind their back. I felt really bad that night and started crying when I got home cause it made me realize I didn‚Äôt know who was being real with me and I felt as tho I was devalued

Flash to today and it was still bugging me but I realized something. Those people aren‚Äôt exclusively making fun of people like me, but making fun of a lot more than a stutter. People are made fun of for stutters, tics, religion, sexuality, lisps, appearance, and more. I realized it‚Äôs not my problem to worry about them and most people that make fun of others will show themselves with time and real nice people will never do that. This made me content and I was happy, I forgot about it for the most part and went about my business 

But I posted something to reddit about it and someone said they had a similar experience and it lead to going into psychosis and being paranoid about people talking badly about them. This made me almost have a panic attack when I was eating with my parents because going psychotic is one of my biggest fears. Ever since then I‚Äôve felt so anxious. It took a good 30-60 minutes to calm myself down and not be on the edge of a panic attack. Ever since then I can‚Äôt shake this thought but now for a different reason. Instead of worrying who‚Äôs judging me. I‚Äôm worrying if I believe it. I‚Äôve had this fear before but when it‚Äôs bad it gets so bad it feels like I‚Äôm already psychotic (even tho I‚Äôm not) and today was one of those days. It feels like the thought you believe if fact and I have terrible depersonalization. This has happened 4-6 times before this and normally after a good sleep my anxiety tones down a bit

But since this is a little different and it started out without that anxiety, does that mean I am going crazy? Instead of thinking anyone is judging me I keep asking myself if I think these specific people at my work would judge me, idk why, once again that was cause OCD started to obsess on it now.

One of them was to smash cups against a brick wall.

I didn't have a cubby hole to label it as intrusive.

I've had far more bizarre intrusive thoughts.

But at that time considered part of my psychotic existence.

After taking some medication I realized how I'd been having many more intrusive and widely varying thoughts than I realized. ### It's the exact same for me!! I read about OCD before but I was convinced it's impossible for me to have it because they were supposed to be unwanted and intrusive. I was totally convinced that since 1. It was me thinking/imagining them and 2. I dwelled on them and didn't always push them away, there was no way i had OCD.

They fully feel like my own normal thoughts.

Especially since they can be full on videos in my head. Plus words. Then I found out intrusive means unwanted and bothersome - yeah, it made me anxious and ruined my days.

I found out it's not normal to prepare yourself or fear or brace yourself or cry over thoughts and it's not normal to fear and dislike your mind because of it all. It's OCD.

And when I found out that you cannot be distressed after some thoughts and enjoy them too, that if you enjoy something you don't feel distress about it itself, it made sense. ### ",29,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tjrqf0/the_meaning_of_intrusive/

For example, as someone who struggles with what looks like contamination OCD (not diagnosed but I show Contamination ODC symptoms and currently going to therapy), seeing my friends and family touching stuff (from walls to public chairs, tables etc) and not washing their hands immediately, touching their face, their belongings... basically everything people without OCD do, makes me jealous and sad, like, seeing them living a relatively normal life, not afraid of getting sick and indeed not getting sick at all...

You feel as though they are superhuman in their ability to live with the potential contamination. 

Also, I have someone close who hasn't publically revealed her OCD type of condition. 

So just remember this too. There will be other people you know or may get to know also struggling from this illness. Or at least a different variation of it. And they may keep that a secret as well. ### I don't have this form of OCD and I'm still in the works of wondering whether I actually have it. But I do know I have severe panic attacks and anxiety around groups of people. I definitely get upset at myself because I don't understand how everyone can just function and have normal conversations, make friends, speak to more than one person at a time without running away. It's hard, but I know everyone has problems of some sort, maybe I just don't see theirs. They're probably jealous of others for any unknown reason(s) as well. ### It just makes me cringe and I don't eat if I see that they didn't wash their hands in advance ### True. I think it'd trigger OCD only if they had it already (had the roots for it). ### >Part of me is scared to lose that because I don‚Äôt want to get contaminated, even though I know it‚Äôs irrational.

I relate to this more than I can say! I'm also doing ERP, but I'm scared of putting myself in danger. Also I'm immunocompromised so that DOESN'T help, to say the least! ### ",122,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tjeo07/does_anyone_else_get_jealous_when_seeing_people/

I've been doing particularly poorly for a couple of weeks now - its getting worse, spoke to a counselor yesterday who said w these symptoms I should see psych for potential medication adjustment (doing it tomorrow thank goodness). 

This rough stretch was triggered by some family issues that has triggered thoughts of sadness, parental mortality, traumatic flashbacks, and a couple of songs that have started to loop in my head nonstop, making me cry. This has been happening for 3 days and I have therefore been on and off crying from waking up to going to bed. No luck in getting it to stop unless I'm in a super technical work meeting or watching really vapid television with my husband. 

I've tried to do research for this, a big consensus seems to be that crying is cathartic but the way it's taken over my brain it just feels traumatic and miserable to me.

Does medication really help? Does it stop? ### Yes, guaranteed it‚Äôs OCD. I‚Äôve experienced the same before I knew that it was in fact OCD. ### hi i‚Äôm someone else but:

medication does not necesarily take away all the intrusive thoughts. in combination with ERP therapy it generally lessens them, and sometimes it can lessen them without therapy. medication does generally allow you to ‚Äúdeal with‚Äù those thoughts in a more productive way, a  la shrugging them off and not assigning meaning to them. it does this by decreasing your anxiety in general, as well as some other stuff. sorry, i‚Äôm super tired so i‚Äôm not writing this super eloquently but basically yes and no, but it‚Äôs still extremely helpful. source: have been on medication (luvox, and now prozac bc of side effects) for OCD since the worst flareup of my life and have generally significantly improved (though i did do ERP for a while as well). i still have plenty of intrusive thoughts and i still have bad days sometimes. it comes and goes. the severity has lessened and i am able to shrug them off better. ### It really helps but doesn‚Äôt solve the problem.

Too lazy to figure out how to do it afterwards ### Have you considered more intensive therapy? There are levels: inpatient, residential, partial hospitalization (which is kind of a misnomer, imo, but it's basically like a full time job except it's therapy), intensive outpatient, and the standard outpatient therapy.

I went to residential last year and it was *life-changing*. Mind you, it's expensive, insurance is a pain, there are only a few programs in the country, and you have to be able to just leave your life for about 8 weeks. But if you can swing it, it's *absolutely* worth it.

I'm not sure about PHP programs, I just did mine at the same place as residential (they prefer to step you down rather then sending you directly back to outpatient), but a lot of hospitals offer IOP programs. They differ a lot but you're looking at about 3 hours a day, 2-5 days a week.

They all include intense individual therapy, group therapy, and typically some skills development (the program I went to did DBT in addition to individualized ERP).

As for ECT, look at the websites for any hospitals near you. If they offer it, it'll probably be on there somewhere, and then you should be able to call and ask about it. They may require a referral, but they should help you through that process if they do. Can't guarantee your insurance will cover it, but with a referral they might. ### That dude is a fraud, always just next med. And the sessions are on the phone..i read that it could help in severe cases but im not 100% sure. I tried to call him today and ask, but he was not working... ### Do not be, there are people who are feeling a lot worse in daily basis. ### That sucks, creepy that they are playing with peoples lifes. ### Okay thanks. I think i might have to wait with that leaving my life for 8 weeks thing. My mother has two different kind of cancers, they shoult start the cell treatment or whatever(sorry my main language is finnish) so she have to be alone in the shutroom somewhere. She needs support now, but maybe after that i could consider trying to apply for that. ### I am assuming you mean your psychiatrist??
Go to a GP if you have one you comfortable with and see what they have to say, consider referral for new psychiatrist if your current one isnt helping you. ### They can have long wait lists, so I'd suggest calling now and telling them about your situation. They can put you on the list but wait until you're able to go even if a spot opens up sooner. ### Okay thanks ### Sorry not much more help. Best to speak to a professional on something like this.

I haven‚Äôt taken it yet because I‚Äôm terrified and nobody understands my hesitation. Im scared it‚Äôll poison me or ruin me, make me sick, etc. Contamination is my biggest theme. It‚Äôs so hard for me to change a skincare routine even because I‚Äôm convinced the new product will make me go blind. I think the meds with help, at least with the extreme anxiety but I can‚Äôt get past this. Even my therapist doesn‚Äôt understand and just says ‚Äúbut if it doesn‚Äôt work, you just come off them.‚Äù

Did anyone else have this issue with going on meds? How did you get past it?",4,2022-03-22 11:40:58-04:00,"I took Zoloft almost 20 years ago for depression.  I took it about two years.  It didn‚Äôt help a ton but I didn‚Äôt have terrible side effects.  I came off it fine with no taper.  Lexapro was terrible but when I stopped after a month I went back to ‚Äònormal‚Äô pretty quickly.

I‚Äôd say try them.  You may be pleasantly surprised. ### I've been on a bunch of antidepressants, including (but not limited to) Lexapro, Zoloft, Efexor and Cymbalta. I'm currently on Prozac and Wellbutrin, and this combination has been great for me. Very, very, very few of the medications I've taken had any side effects besides maybe lowering my libido, and the ones that did weren't SSRIs. The worst that would probably happen is that it would just... not work.

Zoloft worked OK for me, though it wasn't the best I've tried. It could be different for you, though. It might be worth trying! Good luck. ### I understand your hesitation. It can be scary, putting foreign chemicals in our bodies. But please remember - these chemicals are good. They are designed to make you feel better, and their effects are well-researched and heavily documented. They will not poison you. I‚Äôm taking the following meds:

- 200 mg of Zoloft for OCD, depression, and GAD
- 7.5 mg of Abilify for depression
- 250 mg of Nuvigil for narcolepsy
- 20 mg of Ritalin (3x/day) for ADHD
- 5 mg of Sonata for insomnia
- 10 mg of Hydroxyzine (as needed) for acute anxiety flare-ups
- Several dietary supplements recommended by my doctors

It has been a long road getting me on all these medications, but these six pills have changed my life. You will never understand your hesitation again once you find the med that works for you. There is an adjustment period, yes, but your psychiatrist would not give you this medication if they didn‚Äôt think you could handle that period of adjustment. Take this prescription as a show of faith from your psychiatrist in your strength and your ability to overcome your hurdles.

Above all, remember this - you have chosen to get help. That in itself shows that you are a remarkably strong person. Zoloft saved my life. I promise it will not hurt you if you use it as directed and stop taking it if your psychiatrist determines it is not the right med for you. But give it a chance. We all want you to feel better.

tk55mz,"Magical Thinking OCD Does anyone else in this community have Magical Thinking OCD in the form that they believe a ghost or spirit can hear their thoughts and you will be punished by them for it? 

Basically my symptom was it would say the name of someone (friend of a friend) or someone i didnt really know. The name will enter my head randomly then my OCD will try and convince me that I must have been thinking something negative about that person so they will be angered and punish me for it. 

I suppose its a combination of Magical Thinking OCD and False Memory OCD. It has driven me mad for the past 15 years and I am constantly apologizing (As rumination in my head) for any offense my OCD may have caused. 

The logical part of my brain would say there is not even any evidence ghosts / spirits exist?

You cannot remember if it even said anything bad in the first place, and thinking somebodies name alive or not isn't something that would anger anybody? 

If you have apologised and explained so much over the past 10+ years wouldn't they have forgiven by now if there was a small chance my OCD is telling the truth? I would like to think if anybody is judging us it is for the actions we take as human beings not for having a mental illness with intrusive thoughts out of our control? It would be like me apologizing to my mate for 10 years straight for saying one thing negative about them. After a while of constantly apologizing they would get wound up and say.

tk4oo4,"Real Event OCD question Does real event OCD have to be about particularly stark experiences (e.g. trauma) or can the focus become everyday events like social interactions & handling situations. My therapist asked me to look into OCD. The basic description didn't sound like me until I found real event ocd which felt like a 90% match -- ""Oh! Yeah that's it!"". But the more I'm reading about it, some descriptions seem to focus on particular events as the subject, not, like, constant everyday stuff.",7,2022-03-22 10:49:27-04:00,"Real Event OCD is an issue for me and in my experience, my obsessions can be about specific traumatic events, or a vague thematic fear that I scan my memories for evidence, or it can be about small/everyday events or memories. There's really nothing it won't glom onto.

Not a doctor, but I've always viewed OCD as a shapeshifting beast. I've read about different subtypes of OCD and can identify with symptoms of multiples ones and have experienced different types of OCD at different points in my life. I've never had problems with doubting my life/memory/real events until very recently, but I had other OCD symptoms my entire life. 

I always view my own situation as I have OCD -> I have OCD with harm themes -> real event/false memory OCD is an iteration on harm themes. I don't need to fit into a perfect diagnostic box to work on it in therapy and do ERP.

[https://www.treatmyocd.com/blog/real-events-ocd](https://www.treatmyocd.com/blog/real-events-ocd)

This article has a few examples of Real Event ""thoughts"". Some are about everyday events, some are not.

Reading resources for both general OCD and Real Event OCD have helped me understand it a little better - at the end of the day, it's all kind of the same mechanics of Obsessions and Compulsions.

But again, I am not a professional. Just telling my experience. ### Everyday events and bigger events in your past‚Ä¶I have it when I have a convo with someone and I go back and replay it and worry I said something bad to them or mean and can‚Äôt remember ### I think so, so long as it causes distress for you. If it‚Äôs something like positivity looking back at a social interaction I wouldn‚Äôt count it. Also make sure that it can‚Äôt be better explained by something like social anxiety ### Think of it like this. The more you dig at it, then it‚Äôs OCD. It‚Äôs a mental compulsion. stop looking for answers, you will never be satisfied with what you get. ### > I have a convo with someone and I go back and replay it and worry I said something bad

I have some bigger events too, but the bulk of it is very much what you describe here. Thanks. Some of the descriptions I read lead me to believe it was more about fixating on events of significance. ### Thanks, yeah the constant replay is distressing, not like a fond memory. I went in after having harm thoughts and when I started describing the last 10 years of ""doubt"" and ""uncertainty"" over social interactions like my perception was warped the therapist was like ""Have you ever heard of OCD?""

Now I'm reading way too much and, I guess, coming to terms with it. Thanks for your input. ### Thank you for the reminder. I'm still coming to terms with it I suppose. It's especially weird to feel a little better with medication and start wondering if my perception of the problem was worse than reality. This is kind of a mindwarp. ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tk4oo4/real_event_ocd_question/

tk3b5p,"Dating apps, social media, and my OCD made me a creep (or at least made it worse) Look, I‚Äôm not going to blame all my behavior on social media and dating apps (because I will admit there are some major flaws in my personality and how I treat others), but I will say that they had a major impact on how I was treating women and how I was perceiving relationships.

I will also say that I have very severe OCD, and my therapist has advised me that a lot of my behavior has to do with OCD-driven compulsive behaviors, so I have done my best to forgive myself for the inappropriate behavior I engaged in while also realizing that it‚Äôs something I cannot fall into again.

When I first got to college, I was added to a Facebook group and, having gotten out of a relationship a year before, I was really eager to find my next girlfriend. You can see where this is going‚Ä¶ I was bombarded with profiles of beautiful women my age who were in a new environment and clearly didn‚Äôt know anyone, so my POS brain saw this as an opportunity to meet a cute girl with similar interests. Every girl in the group dropped her Snapchat username, and I started compulsively adding every girl I thought was even remotely good looking. And I told them I thought they were good looking. What I thought at the time were innocent and flirty interactions, totally normal for a new college student was, in retrospect, creepy and borderline predatory behavior. I continued doing this, and developed a reputation at my school for being a creep with an impersonal ‚Äúshotgun‚Äù approach to dating. To this day, I don‚Äôt get invited to parties, and I spend most of my time alone in my apartment. I would spend hours on end swiping through dating apps, swiping right on everyone so that I could get the ‚Äúrush‚Äù of a ‚ÄúYou got a new match!‚Äù notification. Things eventually took a turn for the worse when I started ‚Äúslyly‚Äù sharing my opinions on hookup culture with women in an attempt to find out what they thought about it and maybe find an ‚Äúin‚Äù to have sex with a girl.

How did social media and dating apps lead to this behavior, you ask? Well, as I stated, a large part of it was some serious personal issues that I desperately needed to work out in therapy. I will not deny that. The other part was the instant gratification I had grown to expect from social media, and the barrage of attractive, happy couples on Instagram posting pictures of themselves having fun at parties and with friends. I desperately wanted to be a part of this culture, and my sexual drive was making me engage in behaviors that I would, in a healthy mindset, find abhorrent.

Once I worked through some of these personal issues and finally got off of social media and dating apps, going so far as to get a flip phone and ditch my smartphone, things got a lot better. I still haven‚Äôt met a girl yet who I connect with on a deep level, but that doesn‚Äôt bother me as much anymore. I still have an iPad that I use for reading music (I‚Äôm a musician) and occasionally relapse into the dating apps, but the time between when I sign up and when I come to my senses and delete my account is becoming smaller and smaller with each occurrence.

If you are on the fence about whether you should get rid of your smartphone and social media, treat this story as a cautionary tale, especially if you have obsessive-compulsive tendencies. You may never reach the point of extreme anxiety and self-loathing that I did - walking down the street and thinking that everyone who passed was talking about me and what a POS I was - but you will feel worse than you could if you keep indulging in the digital world with no boundaries. These devices are ruining our lives, and they catapulted a person who did not need to be on social media into inappropriate behaviors that, while not entirely (and not even mostly) attributable to technology, were made much worse and echoed much father than they would have been without a smartphone always at the ready.

Again, please, please do not think that I am attempting to blame technology entirely for my behavior. I am simply stating that technology was a major contributor to my incorrect perception that what I was doing was appropriate. I want it to be perfectly clear that I take full responsibility for my actions, while also acknowledging that technology amplified the scope of my behavior by a considerable margin.",0,2022-03-22 09:42:41-04:00,,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tk3b5p/dating_apps_social_media_and_my_ocd_made_me_a/

tk24kz,"What if I just stop doing all compulsions - advice? Scroll to the last paragraph if you don't want to read this whole thing as it will be long.

Since late 2019 I have struggled with OCD that has continually gotten worse and worse until now it is debilitating and affecting me in all areas of life. It actually started when I was staying up so late during the school holidays that my mum would wake up while I was still awake (around 6 AM or whatever.) She would open the door to my backyard and I would want to shut it but I would go crazy not being able to because she if I did she would catch me awake, until she finally left for work and I was able to go shut the door, easing all my anxiety. After this I found myself having to go shut the door whenever it was opened, and started having to 'push' it shut (it's a sliding door so I would like push it into it's closing part if that makes any sense.) This was my first compulsion, but it wasn't my last. Soon I would develop the same thing with the door to my hallway, having to 'push' it shut whenever it was opened, and 'push and push' it. Then it was my brother's headphones being laying off his desk onto the ground - I would have to pick them up if I ever saw them, or heard them drop. Then it was the bathroom, whenever somebody went I would have to flush the toilet - even if they already did, then I would have to put the seat down, and arrange the toilet mat to be 'perfect'. Then came the taps - I would have to turn the tap fully over to cold when 'push it in' whenever somebody turned it on - I even broke my tap doing this. And then it was the lights - this was actually my brother's compulsion first - he too struggles with OCD, as does my Dad, who struggled with it his entire life, and has been in the Mental Health ward of a hospital for the past few months due to it. This means I grew up around other people living with OCD and have direct genetic heritage from somebody who was hospitalised due to it - which is probably a key factor in why my OCD is so debilitating. My brother would have to turn the loungeroom light on after the kitchen light was turned on by someone else, and the kitchen light could only be on if the loungeroom light was already on. I dont know what caused this compulsion, but because he was doing it so much, I started doing it as well - like the rest of my compulsions, I knew it was stupid. I have no delusions, I don't think anything is bad if I don't do any of my compulsions. But when somebody does something, likes opens the door - my brain simply *does not* shut up. I cannot enjoy anything until I do the compulsion, I cannot concentrate on homework until I do the compulsion, I can barely function. And I tell my brain ""SHUT THE FUCK UP, WHAT YOUR SAYING MAKES NO SENSE. WHY TF DO I HAVE TO DO THAT?"", and I try and try to fight it, but I just cant, I just fucking have to do my compulsion so I can get on with life. The worst part is, my OCD only used to affect me at home, but this year it started affecting me at school - if I was worried that I hadn't done one of my compulsions before I left, then I wouldn't be able to concentrate on work, so I started spending ages doing all my compulsions at my house over and over again before I left for school, which continually caused me to be late. 

This brings to my point - what if I just stopped? Of course i've tried this before, but i've never committed longer than a few hours, the anxiety would be too intense and I'd just do what I had to do to get along with life and be able to do something I enjoyed. But I cannot live like this anymore. I am suicidal and have been for some time, and I try to hide it from people, but I am completely miserable. I have a complete awareness of my condition and how irrational each and every one of my compulsions is, but my brain just doesn't shut the fuck up and my anxiety just doesn't ease, the behaviour is ingrained too deeply that my anxiety wont go away until i do a compulsion. But what if I just stopped. What if I powered through the anxiety, my thoughts, and just never did a compulsion again. I know for a fact that i'd been living in hell for at least a few days - at least while at home, where I wouldn't really be able to do anything while at home - but at school I think I might be able to have my friends distract me, because the only thing that can make me forget about my compulsions is if i'm deeply ingrained in conversation with my friends, and in a place where I cannot do my compulsions (aka not in my house.) While being at home would be extremely hard, if I just never did a compulsion again, would my OCD get better? I don't care if it takes weeks, I cannot live like this anymore, and i've gotten to a point where I believe I am willing to do whatever it takes and believe I could get through this. So i'd like to hear advice from anybody who has tried something like this, and if it will work and eventually my anxiety and compulsions will ease or, if I do this, will I just be 'in the red zone' forever, so to speak?",1,2022-03-22 08:42:09-04:00,"If you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please do not hesitate to talk to someone.

tjwlln,"Why is trying to be happy so painful? I just noticed that for a while I've been able to actually feel happiness and enjoyment in my interests again after dealing with numbness for a long time about them. I wasn't exactly depressed but I fell into a weird state where my brain all of a sudden had the ability to take my happiness by just the mere thought of ""what if I don't like it?"" I'm feeling like how I was again when I was 14-16, being able to feel euphoria and feeling blushy about guys I'm attracted to.

But now I'm in that rut again where I get really attached to the things that I enjoy like characters. I'll do a lot of research about them and invest a lot of my time with them but then if that character I like ends up with a fate I didn't want, I get really obsessed and upset about it for a while, then I lose interest with them and then I obsess about the fact that I lost something to be happy about. It makes me feel embarassed.

It's so tough that I already still deal with my brain threatening to take away any serotonin/dopamine about things I love. I try to avoid saying anything in my brain that would trigger it to not end up feeling numb again. It's just so tough balancing these feelings.",6,2022-03-22 02:27:17-04:00,"It's wrong to try to feel happy, because it's such a bummer when you have that expectation and happiness doesn't come.

tjgp80,"What's your technique against intrusive thoughts? Usually I listen to songs, watch tv shows, mostly The Simpsons, and play games. What's your technique?",79,2022-03-21 13:10:15-04:00,"I let them flow through me, I don't engage I just accept that they are there. ### I heard a great technique from a therapist on a podcast called the OCD Stories on Spotify (recommend). Basically you just say in your head ‚Äúyeah definitely. Also I‚Äôm (insert whatever you‚Äôre doing at the time).‚Äù So let‚Äôs say you get an intrusive thought about being secretly gay while you‚Äôre cooking dinner, you say in your head ‚Äúyeah 100% I‚Äôm gay! Also I‚Äôm making dinner‚Äù and then you just leave it at that and continue making dinner. And I‚Äôve found that I can just rinse and repeat this and eventually the thought gets less intrusive and leaves me alone. Honestly the most powerful technique for non-engagement that I‚Äôve ever used, I think because it shifts your attention into the present moment, and just agrees with the thought without engaging. If agreeing with the thought is too uncomfortable for you at first then I‚Äôm sure just saying something like ‚Äúyeah, maybe‚Äù would be similarly effective ### Audiobooks constantly. Medication. Sometimes I just let the thoughts come and let them leave, not fighting against them. 
It‚Äôs hard when it‚Äôs related to anger, though. I dwell dwell dwell on stuff and go through cycles of anger and sadness really quickly and for weeks ### The simpsons work! Also how I met your mother üòÇ Sometimes I just let the thoughts be there but if I feel too anxious and can‚Äôt handle them, I watch tv shows ### I always imagined that I'm a taxi driver and my intrusive thoughts are like an annoying passenger. 

""Hey, you touched that weird rock on the ground. You're probably cursed. What are you gonna do about it?""

(Turns around, looks the fake passenger in the eyes)

""Shut up."" ### Grounding then mindfulness. In the long term, meditation to strengthen my executive mind. Music fits into that nicely -- to really focus on the sounds, a single instrument, a melody (or lack there of) is very meditative. Ambient is great.

Watching TV or a movie won't work for me. It rarely engages my mind and I find myself staring at the screen while my mind goes into overdrive. Video games might work because it takes concentration & executive control, but if I'm not into it I'm not into it. ### Head shake, or click fingers three times 

Which, thinking about it, just sounds like another compulsion ### I try breathing techniques. There‚Äôs this Buddhist monk on YouTube who teaches different methods, which help me whenever I get anxiety or OCD symptoms. Meditation, exercise, and relaxation is key for me. Here‚Äôs the link if you want to check out the breathing methods:

https://youtu.be/Uq7nBj17maA ### Often I will just. Walk to the beach. It‚Äôs about 30 min from my house on foot & most of my intrusive thoughts just. Don‚Äôt apply there. It‚Äôs just me and the trees and the water. Doesn‚Äôt matter the weather I‚Äôm pretty hardy. Alternatively I‚Äôll just go drive around and look at cars and stuff for a while. My car is like‚Ä¶ A space where I feel safe and at peace. Most of my thoughts are centered around my house and my living space so getting out of that helps break the cycle & set them at ease for a while. ### I try to find something stimulating to take my mind off them. I do my best to recognize that they're just thoughts, I can't change them and they don't mean anything ### Yes. I am a person who can sleep for 18 hours a day and still wake up tired. It is just how much my brain thinks and assesses things, whether logical or not, it always finds something to obsess over. ### Depends on the thought and how good I am with coping with it. I‚Äôve gone through ERP before when I had very bad harm ocd and if I get those thoughts they rarely bother me. Honestly sometimes I‚Äôll dig into the thought just to annoy my ocd and keep it in check hahaha. But I‚Äôve recently been having health ocd and I find ignoring the thought very difficult. I‚Äôll do the exact same things you do and usually a few of them at the same time. So yeah just depends on how much I‚Äôve addressed the theme really. ### You already got a lot great advice here.

And it really just boiles down to if you give the thoughts attention or not.

Like, im sitting on my sofa now, my neighbors are building something, the kids are coming back from school and are screaming (not mine lol) the birds are singing, I can hear the washing machine from my other neighbors .... Where do I put my focus? On none of them. It's the same principle with ocd thoughts. 

I know it's sounds so dumb, I swear I know how those thoughts can fuck one up Le Big Time but it's really just that.

See the thoughts and then let it be.

It really helps to agree with the thought. ""I will die today"" ""yh bitch you will!""

Those thoughts are like stupid ass Karen's! Give them what they want, don't get angry, they are fuled by anger!! That's their life! So just agree. Or like Mr. Bean said "" never argue with an idiot!"" (the idiot being ocd :)) ### My therapist told me to write down my key thought, hot thought and counter thought whenever I'm suffering from intrusive thoughts. It helps me to put myself into realistic and logical perspective but I have to do it all the time when I get them. It doesn't help long term. I try to listen to loud music whenever my intrusive thoughts are repeating over and over again. Journaling is something I did ever since I was young. It helps me to write down all my intrusive thoughts and leave them in the paper. Intrusive thoughts is the main OCD type I have and it's honestly so exhausting and depressing. So sometimes I don't really ""cope"" but the above methods help. ### Allow them to be there, and immediately go into distraction where I occupy my attention with a many senses as possible (ie put calm music on, while taking out a paper to draw on) ### There is a secret to this. It is not the thoughts that scare you. When you realize that what scares you has NOTHING to do with your thoughts they will cease to disturb. YOU are disturbed because  you are generally afraid, not because the thoughts scare you. So please find what scares you, really breathe and ask yourself what scares you. Remember, it has nothing to do with the thoughts. It is something else and the trick is, that something else has nothing to do with the content of your intrusion. So battling your thoughts is futile as they bring no insight.  Ask yourself then ""What am I truly afraid of?"" ### In all honesty just telling my brain to stfu and stop thinking it runs the world ### Can someone fully describe what intrusive thoughts can look like? I got recently diagnosed with OCD but I never understood it completely. I know the basic ‚Äústab your co-worker‚Äù intrusive thoughts but what are the thoughts that are most common in OCD? ### I have difficulty with that, if I dont listen to music or watch a tv show, i have difficulty to escape the thoughts. ### That sounds interesting,  I am gonna give it a try. ### I think I'm going to give this a try. My OCD intrusive thoughts are mostly anxious ones so agreeing that it ""may"" happen or ""it might be"" would help me in accepting the fear and move on. ### I need to distract myself to get rid of the thoughts, have difficulty to accept, or even fight them. ### I used to watch it, but it doesnt help, cant binge watch, after a while my thoughts have started a trip in nowhere lol. I binge watch The Simpsons, because I watched each episode already hundreds of time, so I know the most episode by heart. ### Never tried to deal with my thoughts, mostly because I avoid dealing with them. ### I see, I play the music I added to playlist, mostly because of the melody, mostly songs I listen alot before from different genre.

Tv shows works in my case, but not always, after a while my thoughts leave the place and wander somewhere else. I understand that with games, needs alot focus, feels like the brain is in stand by. ### I use finger snapping too. Unfortunately it's becoming more of a problem than a refocusing technique and I'm learning how to let go of it üòÖ ### Never tried such techniques, now I feel dizzy :D ### I have my difficulty with meditation, but I will give it a try, thx for the link. ### Dont have a beach near, but on vacation, I woke up at 5 am and walked few kilometer, was awesome. ### Wish I could do that easily, I can turn them off only when engage myself with something, and only work for a bit, before intrusive thoughts comes back. ### Damn, that's awful ### I didnt have ERP thru psychiatrist yet, probably because I am too afraid to deal with intrusive thoughts. Also have alot isssues, and talk about different stuff each time. ### Yup, got a lot great advices, really appreciate that they took time to reply and give advices.

I am aware they are only thoughts, but thoughts that mess up my mind. The comparsion with karen is great and accurate. ### If you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please do not hesitate to talk to someone. The wonderful u/froidinslip has

I also turn the volume up of the song so it attacks my ocd/intrusive thoughts, works for a bit. ### I tried that with drawing, worked sometimes, but either I stopped drawing, because had no idea what do next, or my ocd kicked in ### Problem is there are multiple thoughts which I cant escape, nor fight. Your technique is interesting. ### Good technique, mine unfortunately runs and ruins the world in my mind. ### Most common are contamination ocd and intrusive thoughts, contamination is fear of touching something unclean, that cause to wash hand multiple times. Intrusive thoughts are thoughts that come out of nowhere, thoughts you would never imagine to think, harming others is an example, thoughts that repeatedly wander thru your brain without a chance of controlling it. There are more, like organization and control ocd, which are milder, but no very harmless, they are more popular  because of mainstream. ### It depends on your themes. Some examples are ‚ÄúWhat if I‚Äôm gay?‚Äù (When you actually aren‚Äôt) ‚ÄúWhat I‚Äôd I‚Äôm a pedophile?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat if I‚Äôm going to get divorced/be unhappy with my partner?‚Äù (Even if their generally a great fit.) ### Don't worry, that's normal. It's like a muscle you have to exercise.
Start small and work your way up, trust me you'll feel like a boss once you get the hang of it.

Don't escape, embrace. ### Remember that the goal is not the escape the thoughts but to show them irrelevance. We all avoid them sometimes but if the avoidance becomes a compulsion it can make the thoughts more frequent. 

My strategy is to grab the thoughts and go to 100% intensity. For example if I think ‚ÄúWhat if I die next time I drive‚Äù or something I‚Äôd say ‚ÄúYeah, totally. That could happen. It probably will, actually. I might as well just go drive now to get my death over with.‚Äù I try to make it a little extreme and funny which is entertaining after enough practice. The first time I did it I had a big spike in anxiety but it dipped quickly. It‚Äôs helped a lot and I notice I‚Äôm less afraid of the scarier thoughts now. ### I‚Äôve seen HIMYM for like I don‚Äôt know, 10? times and still I start it over and over again. It‚Äôs maybe because I remember each damn MINUTE of that show that if I get an intrusive thought in the middle of watching it, it‚Äôs somehow easy to distract my mind by focusing what happens next in the show, so I even might forget the intrusive thought ### No problem. Best of luck. ### the point isn't to draw, the point is to do things to distract yourself until the anxiety goes away. That includes when it ""kicks"" in again you keep doing the activities until you're distracted again ### It's okay. I understand how it feels. It's like it is impossible to give up the thoughts. Don't worry about it. This is one of those things where you don't force or force to escape the thoughts. You just do. Start with breathing, and find what scares you. Breathing is very important. Try to breathe until you can take a full breath then do it till you feel relaxed - if you take a close look you won't be able to breath fully at the beginning. When you start being calm find what you are afraid of. And please stop trying to fight the thoughts, or embrace the thoughts, or anything with the thoughts. Your life is in chaos for reasons you can't even comprehend now. Realising little by little what scares you will truly help you. Good luck! ### Yeah it does that sometimes. You can and will get through it. I'm here after having CBT and it helped a lot, makes things easier to rationalise ### I was told that a few times, also on here, but I have difficulty with that, I know is not healthy, but I rather try to escape everything instead to deal with it. ### I can relate to this a little bit. One of my common intrusive thoughts is thinking I might die / am dying (usually for no reason). Usually I need to get up, move around, breathe, sip water, etc. for a few minutes and then I'm okay.


Sometimes it turns into a dark but sorta funny conversation with my OCD.
""WHAT IF WE'RE DYING AND THIS IS FINALLY HOW WE GO?!"" to which I typically respond with something like, ""We're all dying slowly, everybody dies someday."" I think about that realistically for a minute and then just try to go about my day. ### If you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please do not hesitate to talk to someone.

I watch mostly season 1-11, then repeat or keep watching til last season, but I skip alot episodes which are really bad.

Also I cant shower without the phone and the simpsons. ### I also am the same way w HIMYM lol! Im like this with all my fav tv shows (fam guy too) it must be an ocd thing. When i was younger i used to memorize episodes of spongebob and play them in my head before bed or in class üòÇ ### You are right and thats a good advice, but then my fear takes over, which makes it difficult to go back to it. I feel like The Simpsons are only thing that can fight my intrusive thoughts, and I cant even explain how. ### I just tried that with breathing. Usually when my ocd kicks in I feel like my chest and belly are getting crushed.

I am not trying to fight, rather avoid them, which is not healthy ofc :( ### I am learning alot new terms since created this post. Reading them all, didnt realize there were alot stuff, research and techniques about ocd. ### The longer you escape, the harder it will hit you.

Like sometimes I just try not to run and instead go all the way to laying down and giving up. It‚Äôs almost like it shows the thought that it‚Äôs not going to get a dopamine reward so over time it knows that you‚Äôre not going to be triggered. ### I sometimes have that bad days or seasons too that even in the shower I can‚Äôt ‚Äùface myself and my thoughts‚Äù. I‚Äôm sorry you have to go through this kind of bullshit ### I‚Äôve been thinking too that it might be an ocd thing üôà ### use what works thats good ### Very good! When that crushing feeling comes don't stop breathing. Quite the opposite, keep on breathing. You have to let your body know you are not in danger! Don't be too harsh on yourself. This is not a sprint,not even a marathon, it is a journey. Also, it is very important to incorporate this with a sport -cardio. For me it was cycling, for others it is  running or swimming. They help you breath and also they make your body release endomorphines which have a positive effect on your mood-reduced anxiety, increased mental clarity and many more. ### CBT stands fro cognitive behavioural therapy, it's a therapy method aimed at kind of retraining your brain to rationalise properly. If you can, try and contact a local therapist, it really helped me a lot :) good luck ### True :( I feel that is getting worse, I didnt leave my home for days, and usually I hardly leave my home to avoid triggering my ocd. ### Thx, I am also sorry you have to go through this. Wish you good luck in the fight against ocd. ### I dont swim anymore because of ocd, and cycling not really much. Walking mostly which helps to most part, when not much people around. I will try that breathing. Thx for all advices :) ### I have a psychiatrist. I just read what that is after you posted.

Thx and good luck to you too. ### Time to take up your sword and fight your condition like a monk.
Get to that zen state, you know what I mean? Meditate.

Also try a breathwork (by wim hof), it'll ease the pain for some minutes, gives you a break that you direly need ### Happy to help! Good luck and Don't take life too seriously! :) ### I tried with meditation, but didnt work, my thoughts took always the control over. I was told to listen to podcasts during meditation. ### Yes sir :) and thx and also good luck to you too. ### It won't work at the beginning, again it takes time.
Listening to guided meditations kinda depends, if you have one which makes you observe your thoughts and not engage them, then heck yeah go for it! ### Thank you ! :) ### Thats a good suggestion, yeah, I have to work on it, even tho I will struggle. Thx for the suggestions sir. ### My pleasure, may you find healing and inner piece. ### The more you try and fight the stronger your compulsions will be. I lived through that, I would hate to see another person go through that. Check out NOCD, and try ERP. It‚Äôs the gold standard and has really helped me. ### Thx sir, likewise :) ### They keep getting stronger from day to day. But my mind think is better to ignore them, not healthy I know.

I'm reading and writing so I can assimilate what I'm studying better but my mind just doesn't shut up. And It can be so exausting... I feel worse cause I think I'm not being as productive as I could cause I have to write almost everything to ""read for real"". I can't even read for fun anymore, my brain turns everything as a chore and even when I actually have to sit down and work (study) i can't stop thinking and thinking about random issues and then the intrusive thoughts try to sabotage me into giving up cause I'll fail anyway. Which is worse is that even If I actual give up, ocd won't leave me alone because then they'll give me the enormous amount of guilty cause i'm not trying enough or doing enough and I'm a failure and a terrible person :)

tjpsgc,"Is this religious obsession my fault? Asking for any other Christians/religious people on here. Since I was 15 I‚Äôve had this obsession of ‚Äúwhat if I don‚Äôt believe in Jesus?‚Äù It has constantly made me feel disconnected from Jesus, like I don‚Äôt really know who He is even though I‚Äôve read the New Testament, and I constantly have to act on compulsions to believe in Him ‚Äúthe right way‚Äù. It constantly makes me live in fear and hopelessness.

I‚Äôm not trying to say your religion or any other religion is right/wrong. The only person to determine your beliefs, is you. 

I know it‚Äôs easier to say than do, but when it‚Äôs the right time, challenge your beliefs. Maybe you‚Äôll become more faithful in Christianity, maybe you‚Äôll find a different religion that speaks to you, or maybe you won‚Äôt have religious beliefs at all. None of that is wrong. 

I‚Äôm having trouble choosing my words, because I don‚Äôt wanna trigger your OCD. Apparently giving reassurance doesn‚Äôt help with our disorder, so I‚Äôm trying not to do that either. 

For what it‚Äôs worth, in my opinion, religion isn‚Äôt what makes a person, a good person. Your morals do. Challenge that first. If you do choose to look into other religions, *take your time.* I can‚Äôt stress that enough. It‚Äôs okay to learn, and it‚Äôs okay to take it slow too. Don‚Äôt go into searching for answers during times your intrusive thoughts are bad.

Good luck dude, I really feel for you. ### I always take god understands the workings of my OCD brain better than I do and that he understands that I'm trying. I don't need to be perfect, I was never made that way, and he gets that. ### Sounds like OCD. You sound genuinely interested in and desiring Christ. He wants your heart your faith, love above all other things. Love God. Have faith in Christ. Seek help to get the OCD under control check out Mark DeJesus videos on YouTube. Could be a good start for you. God bless. ### Idk but I can definitely relate to having compulsions to follow god ‚Äúthe right way‚Äù (and with it I mean literally everything down to walking ‚Äúcorrectly‚Äù) when I used to be religious. It drove me insane and I always felt like I was sinning for not doing everything perfectly.

As for whether or not you still believe in religion, I think that‚Äôs something you should explore for yourself. I personally found myself questioning my faith until I realized I just couldn‚Äôt believe it anymore, and now I‚Äôm agnostic atheist / apatheist. Of course, that was only my experience. Maybe you‚Äôll see something valuable on religion, or maybe you won‚Äôt. Good luck :) ### take the agnostic pill ### Look up Scrupulosity. It is a sub category of OCD.

tjx5rq,"Am I going crazy? So I have a stutter and I‚Äôve always been insecure about it. I was with my best friend and his friend and his friend made fun of someone‚Äôs stutter because he‚Äôs not aware I stutter. This made me realize how easy it is to make fun of people behind their back. I felt really bad that night and started crying when I got home cause it made me realize I didn‚Äôt know who was being real with me and I felt as tho I was devalued

Flash to today and it was still bugging me but I realized something. Those people aren‚Äôt exclusively making fun of people like me, but making fun of a lot more than a stutter. People are made fun of for stutters, tics, religion, sexuality, lisps, appearance, and more. I realized it‚Äôs not my problem to worry about them and most people that make fun of others will show themselves with time and real nice people will never do that. This made me content and I was happy, I forgot about it for the most part and went about my business 

But I posted something to reddit about it and someone said they had a similar experience and it lead to going into psychosis and being paranoid about people talking badly about them. This made me almost have a panic attack when I was eating with my parents because going psychotic is one of my biggest fears. Ever since then I‚Äôve felt so anxious. It took a good 30-60 minutes to calm myself down and not be on the edge of a panic attack. Ever since then I can‚Äôt shake this thought but now for a different reason.

It feels like the thought you believe if fact and I have terrible depersonalization. This has happened 4-6 times before this and normally after a good sleep my anxiety tones down a bit

But since this is a little different and it started out without that anxiety, does that mean I am going crazy? Instead of thinking anyone is judging me I keep asking myself if I think these specific people at my work would judge me, idk why, once again that was cause OCD started to obsess on it now.

I‚Äôve made great progress with my OCD within the past year, and can‚Äôt help but feel like this is becoming my new target obsession.

tjt4a9,"Has anybody had luck with Prozac? I have been going back and forth for months on whether I should start Prozac or not. About a month ago, my doctor prescribed me 10mg Prozac but I threw it out after freaking out from reading about side effects. It sounds superficial, but the sexual side effects really scare me. But I suffer from sexual intrusive thoughts, which has already destroyed my sex drive entirely, so I do not think I have much to lose there. I have been in OCD therapy for months and have seen some improvement but it is not consistent. I feel miserable constantly and when I am not feeling bad, I feel nothing at all. Doing anything feels 10X more difficult than it used to. All of these things are causing me to believe that I should give Prozac another shot. Can anybody share their experience with the drug and if it helped or not? Thank you so much.",6,2022-03-21 22:50:13-04:00,"I had taken prozac from 12 years old until i was 18 with no issues whatsoever. Until it started to become less effective for no reason lol. My adhd meds also started causing problems around that time so obviously something in my body changed. I have taken over 10 different types of medications over the course of nearly 10 years and never had any severe side effects. I even took heavily regulated meds that were given on a limited basis bc of potential for addiction and never had a problem. Honestly severe side effects are less likely then you think. I say do it. It changed my whole life when i took it, i can genuinely say i wouldn‚Äôt be here today without it. Another medication to consider is Zoloft, im on it right now for OCD and it‚Äôs usually what doctors suggest for OCD according to my GP (the prozac was originally for GAD in my case). I highly recommend it. ### I took Prozac over 25 years ago. To be honest I was so over-medicated at the time I couldn't tell if it was making a difference. It was just another pharmacological to add to the cocktail. 

Personally if I knew now what I knew back then. I would take minimal medication for the shortest period of time. 

These pills are so addictive. The company propaganda says they aren't but I know better.

After a few weeks on them, you'll find it impossible to sleep without their effects. ### If you legit have ocd, don‚Äôt be a dummy, take the medicine ### i‚Äôm on prozac. i don‚Äôt have any of the issues mentioned in the comments, even when i forget a dose. obviously ymmv, but it‚Äôs very helpful for me. i refused to take meds for years bc of fear of GI side effects (which, suprise, was OCD). ### Thank you so much for replying. I wish that I could have started sooner, but every time I get a prescription I end up reading horror stories about how Prozac ruined people's lives and permanently crippled them sexually or in worse ways. Because of that I'd always throw the pills out. But I'd imagine if all of that was really common then they wouldn't prescribe it so much to people. I think I will just trust my doctor and give it a try. I feel like I have nothing to lose from trying, but I could have everything to gain. ### Just know that even if something happens, you can make it through it. You CAN overcome all obstacles, humans are master adapters. I wish you the best and im rooting for you! ### ",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tjt4a9/has_anybody_had_luck_with_prozac/
tjyhwg,"Deleting this app but want some hope and success stories before I go ROCD  

Last night I spent the majority of the evening crying with my boyfriend. I‚Äôd had a moderately anxious day and couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about not loving him. I felt anxious and irritated and shut off from everyone the majority of the day as a result of this thinking. This was awful because on Saturday I felt so in love with my boyfriend. I‚Äôd get random thoughts of ‚ÄúI love him‚Äù or ‚ÄúI love him so much‚Äù, surely I wouldn‚Äôt get those thoughts if I didn‚Äôt? 

Anyway, because I‚Äôd been upset all night my boyfriend gently told me that if I ever have any doubts and I want to break up I should and not to worry about him. I do have doubts and have wanted to break up because that‚Äôs the nature of what I‚Äôm going through at the moment. He said he knows I‚Äôm a people pleaser and that I shouldn‚Äôt stay just to make him happy. I found the entire conversation really upsetting and it was horrible because he touched on so many of the things I was worried about. It‚Äôs in those moments when a break up becomes a near reality or when I imagine it by myself that I know I love him. I can‚Äôt imagine not having him in my life and I‚Äôd love nothing more than to go through life laughing with him and making memories. But I feel as though I‚Äôm hurting him all the time being upset and trying to figure out if I love him or not or find him attractive or not. So it‚Äôs time to put the forum searching to bed because it‚Äôs not fair to him. 

I think this has been one of my most long lasting anxiety themes because I‚Äôve spent so much time on OCD forums and looking through them multiple times a day and reading every new post. So before I delete Reddit and the NOCD app I just wanted to hear some encouragement and maybe some success stories so I can have a goal to reach. Yes, it may be reassurance seeking but it‚Äôs the last time I‚Äôm allowing myself to seek it.

tji2l1,"You OCD sufferers need a reality check (Long Post) RESPONSE POST Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tingl8/you_ocd_sufferers_need_a_reality_check_long_post/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

I am very saddened and disgusted by some of the responses I was seeing under this post, a lot of people ‚Äúupset and offended‚Äù saying I was ‚Äúvictim blaming‚Äù and that I was antagonizing OCD sufferers‚Ä¶ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

To the many people who responded thanking me and saying they needed to hear that, I wish you all luck in implementing what I said in your own recovery and striving to live a happy healthy life again!

Anyways, the fact that some of you, especially a lot of the grown ups, wanna say what you said and act like ‚Äúheroes‚Äù it‚Äôs just disgusting to me. The whole point basis‚Äô of my post was to tell people that some of you truly don‚Äôt understand OCDs functions and what it throws at you. 

I never said beating OCD was easy, I said the concept of beating it is simple, which is to accept the thoughts and anxiety and let them flow in you, and over time as you continue to do this, the OCD will weaken over time, i said it gets easier over time, but that it is extremely hard at first. This is textbook ERP self therapy.

Some people were saying that I got lucky with how fast I recovered and that everyone is different, well is that not obvious? I never said people are gonna recover fast or slow, I said people need to implement self ERP for the rest of their lives, and that accepting your thoughts and anxiety for a few days, a few weeks, a few months, or even maybe a few years is not enough, this is a everyday battle. 

To those people who responded like that, you truly disgust me with how you carry yourself‚Äôs, there are people who are on this forum everyday, who are obviously only making their own OCD worse, and instead of giving them real straight up advice, you wish to reassure them and make them continue to return and feed into their OCD.

Guys please take this from someone who has recovered, indulging in any type of reassurance, does not help, I used to sit in forums all day, it wasn‚Äôt until I deleted every account I had on OCD related forums that I began to recover. 

All I kept seeing was people say, ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt just try harder and except to recover.‚Äù Guys listen, when you want to achieve something, and you make an attempt, but you fail, what do you do? Do you continue to make that same attempt, or do you come back harder with the knowledge and experience you gained from the last failure? Obviously the second one, cuz if you continue to do the first, then you will always be trapped in the OCD cycle, it takes mental strength, knowledge and experience, willpower, and courage to beat OCD. 

Now this is for the people struggling who need advice:

You need to understand that nobody, and I mean nobody in this world can beat OCD for you, this is a battle with your own mind. You must educate yourself on the ins and outs of OCD, whether that be some therapy, or reading information online, via book, or from wherever, educate yourself and then implement the strategies. 

You must understand this will be the hardest battle of your life, and you are alone in this, you might have people to encourage you, but the reality is, this is you vs your mind and nobody else can see or hear your mind besides you. Be prepared to fail, but be even more prepared to bounce back twice as hard, be prepared to counter your OCD and be ready for it to throw new tricks at you constantly. You must learn how to identify OCD thoughts from normal thoughts, and your response needs to be one thing‚Ä¶ NOTHING. DO NOT RESPOND. When you get anxiety and thoughts of OCD, you must let these feelings flow through you, continue doing what you were doing, I had paralyzing anxiety in the beginning, I would have panic attacks, I would have trouble breathing, but you know what I did, I LET IT HAPPEN, I allowed the OCD to come in, and let it do what it wants to me, but the OCD craves one thing, and that is your attention, that is where it grows in power, when you remove this attention factor, you begin to STARVE your OCD, your ocd will begin to suffer and eventually weaken overtime. This is ERP therapy, you are exposed to a fear or thought that induces anxiety, fear, or even any general uncomfortable feelings, and you must prevent your response to it. ERP = Exposure and Response Prevention. 

I gave an example in the last post and I want to give it again, thing about a journey, and you will fail and fail but it‚Äôs about how you bounce back, think like this: 1 step forward, 2 steps back, 3 steps forward 2 steps back, 5 steps forward 1 step back, 10 steps forward 3 steps back, 50 steps forward and 1 step back. Eventually as you keep pushing and pushing to recover, by implementing the strategies you need to implement, you will continue to overpower your OCD.

I always recommend everyone with OCD to imagine a scenario you are in for recovery. What my scenario was, I imagined I was in a hole that was dug in very deep, and as I was recovering I was slowly climbing out, and if I failed I would fall back down a little, and sometimes I would fall back to the bottom, but I was getting better and smarter with my OCD and so I would climb up even faster then before, until eventually I got myself out of the hole, now I‚Äôm outside the hole but the battle isn‚Äôt finished, now I must throw the OCD into the hole, and begin to bury it, until it is completely silenced and all you can hear is OCD whispers in your head. As I would push for recovery, I said it in my last post and I‚Äôll say it again, whenever I did self ERP right, like I would get a a thought with a huge anxiety wave and not respond, I felt I was climbing out slowly and I was continuing to level up. 


I‚Äôll answer any questions in the comments, I hope I don‚Äôt see these soft snowflakes again who are gonna whine about my post being ‚Äútoo aggressive.‚Äù If you aren‚Äôt ready to fight back your OCD then by all means continue to let it control you. But if you are ready, then you must be ready for war, this is the toughest battle I ever went through, bad I‚Äôm sure it will be yours too. 

This is coming from someone who was diagnosed with 10/10 severity OCD. I would have constant thoughts, anxiety, and would ruminate from the moment I woke up to the moment I went to bed. It got so bad I would dream of doing compulsions while sleeping. I was severely depressed, I felt there was no hope, many nights of me crying myself to sleep, begging god to let me be free, seeing other people able to live normal lives but I was stuck in my OCD head. Many days I prayed to god to just let me pass to natural causes, to not wake up one day or to get into a bad car accident, anything to be free from this mental illness. This is a top tier mental disorder, you must be strong, remember bravery is not being scared of nothing, bravery is when your scared but you still fight for what you believe in you, bravery is seeing a scary path but continuing to walk it, be brave guys, I was scared and it was so hard at first to recover, but overtime it got easier. I suffered multiple themes at once at multiple points as a teenager, I suffered so hard, by no means was my journey easy. It took me over a year of constant self ERP, avoiding all compulsions, and yes I did fail over the path but as I kept pushing harder and bouncing back my failures become less frequent until I didn‚Äôt fail anymore. 

When I was in my OCD thought cycle, I thought life would never be the same, I thought I could never be happy again. Boy was I wrong. I love life now, I wake up everyday happy as hell for no reason, yes I still have OCD but I have buried it so deep that everytime I hear it‚Äôs whispers I laugh at it, same way I laugh everytime I remember all my OCD fears. Remember, this is a everyday battle for the rest of your life, so be prepared, I could easily dig up and fall back into that hole tomorrow if I indulged in my OCD, but it‚Äôs so weak now that‚Äôs it‚Äôs easy to ignore. 

I love you guys, have hope, be brave, you can do this I promise, I thought I had no hope but I did it, push yourself harder then you ever have before, and ignore any of these snowflakes who will tell you otherwise. Best of luck and all love I will pray for you guys and I‚Äôll respond to any questions or comments‚ù§Ô∏è",11,2022-03-21 14:11:16-04:00,"A lot of important information here. A lot of it is extremely helpful. Can I ask if you take any medications? Or used to? ### The problem isn't your advice. We all know about ERP guy, you're not enlightening anyone. Your issue is that no one wants mental health advice from some internet dude-bro making condescending remarks. No offense but your delivery is a turn off and you should reflect on that instead of lashing out ### Bro nicely put. I read your other post too and thought it was awesome. Currently trying to get Better from this. Has been bad for some time but is actually getting better. Plz feel free to message me if you want. Thanks mate ### I was wondering what happened to your original post I had it saved to read it again a second time, but it actually sickens me to know that someone who dealt with having OCD and found out a way to get better took the time to sit down to write a post about what how to beat the disease only for their post to get deleted by a mod within a day.  I don't care if I get downvoted for saying this but ever since I joined this subreddit I noticed that it was mainly designed for people to seek sympathy and reassurances. Sure there are achievement stories of people going on and sharing what it's like to be on the otherside, but it's largely overcast by people just venting for upvotes and reassurance. Anyways sorry for the vent :), thanks for taking the time to post again ### Nope, no medication whatsoever. The doctor that diagnosed me was really suggesting it for me back then, I kept refusing, and at the time I wasn‚Äôt refusing because I wanted to act tough, but as a 14 year old kid the thought that I needed medication kinda terrified me, it is really hard to explain I was just scared so I rejected it completely. 

Looking back though, best decision I ever made. I beat OCD without medication, and I do not recommend medication for OCD, im not saying don‚Äôt take it but in my personal experience I don‚Äôt recommend it, obviously you would have to speak to a health professional in regards to meds, but here is why I don‚Äôt recommend it: OCD is a mental battle, and if you use meds to aid you, then what happens when you want to stop taking your meds or you forget to take them? OCD will just come right back over you full force because in reality you didn‚Äôt really beat it, you just had something suppressing it. HOWEVER I have seen stories of people who used meds to slowly aid them through the horrible times of the early recovery stages and slowly decreases the meds until they were fully off of it, but the reason why I won‚Äôt take it is I feel that I can beat it, and so can others, without it, and i feel personally it would be better to beat OCD naturally without the aid of medicine, but hey that‚Äôs from my personal experience, so take what I say with a grain of salt and it would be much better to speak with a health professional about medication! ### If nobody wants advice from internet people then why are they here? How did I lash out? I went out of my way to give advice, how does that turn you off? What have I said that was condescending? Please explain this to me. ### Sorry for the late response bro, happy you got a good read out of this, how have you been dealing with your OCD? What strategies have you implemented and how successful do you think you have been? ### Yeah man, I posted again because there were like 30 comments of people thanking me, and the top comments were all stolen by people complaining and crying about how my post comes off as antagonizing and rude. It‚Äôs insane how some of these people were people who are in their 30‚Äôs acting like that, it‚Äôs no wonder some are still suffering, it‚Äôs because they WONT ACCEPT THE TRUTH. 

I feel bad for them, because I was once just like them, I didn‚Äôt want to do ERP, I didn‚Äôt want to stop my compulsions, I didn‚Äôt wanna stop seeking reassurance, I didn‚Äôt wanna take the hard way. 

Some even said I made my post because I wanted to show everyone that I‚Äôm better at recovery then everyone else LOL! It‚Äôs insane dude, how people run from the truth, but that‚Äôs why some need that reality check, and the ones who read and listened and took something out of it are the ones who are another step closer to recovery. 

Maybe the mods deleted my post because I suggested that everyone needs to get off this forum, the sad reality is, this forum does not help. Like I said in my post, I didn‚Äôt get better until I deleted every account I had that was involved with OCD. You have to remember, 0 reassurance. Your brain will break the OCD pathways as you continue to break the cycle by not indulging in the OCD thoughts and anxiety by doing compulsions rituals.

When you give in to compulsions, you basically teach your brain that whatever thought scared you, it was meant to scare you because you responded scared. So your OCD brain will remember this and then throw that same thought at you again and as you keep responding with compulsions or rituals for short term reassurance, you strengthen the OCD because it‚Äôs training your brain that whatever your OCD is saying is extremely important and everytime you get a OCD thought, your brain will begin sounding alarms in your head. Now as you start to break this cycle of Thought - Anxiety - Compulsion - Reassurance, your brain will start to rewire and become retrained to not perceive OCD thoughts as important as it perceived them before, essentially making the power of the thoughts weaker, making the anxiety and fear weaker, which then leads into you not fearing whatever the OCD theme or thought it as much, until eventually you recover. 

Break the cycle
Thought ‚Äî Anxiety ‚Äî No compulsion ‚Äî No reassurance

You will notice the power of the thoughts decreasing, it may take a long time, but you got this bro, lmk if you got any questions ### No, learn to take some criticism if youre gonna be as loud and opinionated as you are. I dont owe you an explanation for any of that, i said what i said ### Mostly just decided to actually take action instead of just sitting and begging God for it to stop. Realizing He loves me, also not responding to thoughts or having any reaction knowing I‚Äôm safe and it‚Äôs not important has no meaning to it. Realizing they‚Äôre just thoughts and can‚Äôt harm me in any way. Really change happened when I was fed up and took real action to see change. Thanks man ### yeah thank you, my brother, I sure do. I already have it in my head that the thoughts are just that, thoughts, whether they're good or bad and it's not something I can control because it's not a part of me, the only thing I can control is my reaction. Just living through the""uncertainty"" part is hard because of the anxiety stemming from it but in due time I know I've got this.

Still haven‚Äôt driven üôàüôà ### 29 next month, I got my beginners when I was 16 and decided not to drive because I was scared for a variety of reasons.

I‚Äôm convinced I‚Äôll die in a car accident. I‚Äôm learning to drive at 27. You‚Äôre doing fantastic! ### Congratulations! Good luck! ### I got my license at 28 because I was terrified of driving. I had a friend (and 3 other youth I didn't know) killed in a horrible accident when I was 16 (when we're old enough to get our G1 where I'm from) and looking back I think that was probably the event that really set the intrusive thought aspect of my OCD. I did drivers ed, and I was the oldest in the class by far but oh well. I don't think I would've ended up driving if I hadn't taken it. It made me feel confident in my driving while still being defensive and mindful of the fact that driving is dangerous. I still get nervous about driving but it's amazing how much more comfortable I am being the one behind the wheel. Going for long drives on my own has actually  become very therapeutic for me too, which is an added bonus. I feel like not being in control is a big factor for me. I do tend to worry more about other people being in car accidents than myself being in one. 

Congratulations on taking on what I know is incredibly challenging. You should be proud of yourself!! ### All power to you! You got this. ### So proud of you!! I remember when my dad dropped me off at my first driving lesson and I cried because I was so scared, now it‚Äôs a lot easier to drive ! ### Keep at it, good luck ### Thats awesome bro, you should be proud of yourself. Whether you pass or fail the test, you having gained the courage to face this fear is a big positive step forward that shows you are heading in the right direction. Damn right OCD is a liar, the best way to expunge it is through using the truth to your advantage and through facing your fears head on, as you just did my friend. Congrats! I hope you passed the test, if you didn't though just remember how big of a step you still took!

Btw, driving is one of the funnest activities there are in my opinion. I have a different form of OCD so driving doesn't bother me thankfully, however I can tell you that one of my all time favorite things to do is to go for a nice long car drive into the country outside of my city or downtown and through my cities neighborhoods.

Good job, OP! I hope you did alright, eh! God bless you my friend ### So so proud of you!! üéâ And you‚Äôre absolutely right - it is NEVER too late! Coming up on one year of having my driver‚Äôs license and I‚Äôm 28! ### I am the same way lol.

At my lowest I will call a family member to follow me home. It's okay to have bad days but never give up! ### So happy for and proud of you OP!!! I know what a struggle that particular spiral can be, but here you are, taking control and making an enormous step for yourself and passing the positive message forward. Nothing but luck and love to you, you got this. :) ### I had crippling driving anxiety/panic attacks while driving for a long long time, but I ended up buying a car 800 miles away and had to drive it home. That long drive helped my driving anxiety soo much, probably the exposure? ### You're doing great!!! It's so hard to live with this stuff ### that‚Äôs awesome!! ### I‚Äôm pretty much in the same boat. I drove on a permit from ages 16-18 and never got the license. I was too nervous of others at the time, plus I didn‚Äôt need it. A few months ago I got my permit again at age 28! License I‚Äôm coming for you! ### thank you!! i‚Äôm proud of you too <3 ### I had issues driving for a while and still have some but I went from not being able to drive even just down the road to driving cross country solo within the same year. You guys got this. ### thank you!! it‚Äôs all about when you‚Äôre ready. don‚Äôt let anyone push you into it until you know it‚Äôs time to start. i‚Äôm glad i waited, because it really helped me ease my fear not jumping into something when i know i‚Äôd spiral. ### that‚Äôs awesome!! congratulations :) ### thank you üíú ### If you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please do not hesitate to talk to someone.

I just got my GED a couple years late and now my family is pressuring me to get my driver's license and a social job right in the next 2 months even though my few triggers are heavily involved in those things and I'm still in therapy working on them.... the last time I jumped right into something due to family pressure I had my first ever panic attack and it was the worst most embarrasing experience of my life. I'm especially scared of driving bc I don't want to have a panic attack due to an OCD trigger and possibly put my life or anyone else's at risk, but my family doesn't really understand my disorder and thinks I can just ""get over it"". It's hard and unfair but I'd rather take their disapproval and nagging than jump right into something potentially dangerous. Getting a job and my license is my next goals but I need a little more time in therapy. ### i‚Äôm in the exact same situation. i haven‚Äôt gotten my GED yet, and i currently cannot work because of my bpd and anxiety. i‚Äôm just a mess and trying to sort things out in my own time. i cut family off over them not putting in any effort to understand me. they still make awful comments trying to make me feel like i‚Äôm a loser. remember that people who don‚Äôt want to understand never will. getting your GED is a huge accomplishment that you should be proud of. it‚Äôs enough for now, until you‚Äôre ready to make your way to your next accomplishment. ### ",320,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tizluy/my_ocd_has_given_me_a_crippling_fear_of_driving/
tjmhjf,"Seeking anything I‚Äôve (F19) known about my OCD and PTSD for the last 5 years. It‚Äôs incredibly lonely not being able to explain the way it effects my interactions with my environment. I feel as though I‚Äôm an imposter, I doubt myself and whether I‚Äôm making it all up. 

After Covid lockdown in 2020, I fell into a depression and never left my house. At one point my dryer broke and I had been so stuck in my compulsive routine that I blow dryed my bed sheets with in 4 hours in the middle of the night just so I can sleep on them. 

In December of 2020 after I had left a toxic environment and lockdown was lifted, I got worse again, I had been to a family members (TM) house and triggered by them as they were involved in a terrible period of my life. Since that point I never left my house, I stayed within my compulsive routine. Specifically around contamination, I would wash my bedsheet, clothes and wipe down every surface until I believed it was clean, including using abrasive cleaners to wash my hands, many times resulting in raw skin and cracks. My family would watch these behaviours and become concerned for me often as they didn‚Äôt believe it was normal and I knew it wasn‚Äôt. 

I‚Äôve been making progress incrementally and learned that it‚Äôs okay to only wash my sheets and clothes once a week. I can roll with the punches more often and when I feel like something has been contaminated I will repeat ‚Äúif everything is contaminated, nothing is‚Äù to myself. 

My goal is to learn to leave the house again and find employment in a field that isn‚Äôt overwhelming to me. However my family member (TM) is pushing themselves in to help me, but is forcing me to make promises around my mental health seperate to my goals including threatening to take my computer that I paid for if I do not stay true to those promises. They‚Äôve said that there is no shame but that having friends online isn‚Äôt normal and being inside all the time isn‚Äôt normal, I feel as though I‚Äôm being shamed because I am already pushing myself as far I can go. They do this under the guise of wanting the best for me but, I feel as though if I go too fast, like I did in 2020 I will regress back into that state. 

I‚Äôve been seeing a psychologist and I have a support network of friends, although predominantly online, who are extremely helpful with my process.

tjpz95,"Tips for treating hands from hand washing :) Hello lovely people, and thank you for taking the time to read :)

I‚Äôm currently dealing with some quite sore and stinging hands from washing them so often. 

I understand that exposure therapy etc is what is going to help in the long run however, waitlists and length of time between appointments is absolutely crazy right now. 

Does anyone have any short-term relief tips for painful hands? I‚Äôve tried ice but that seems to just burn. I know good lotions are recommended but I, of course, need to be difficult, I find a lot of difficulty wearing lotion (especially on my hands). I think it is a sensory issue. 

Anyways! I apologise for my rambling but if anyone has any suggestions that would be absolutely amazing. Thank you :)",9,2022-03-21 20:08:49-04:00,"The solution to sore hands from washing them so much is don't wash them so much.

You don't need to wait for therapy to make a concerted effort to reduce your hand washing, in both duration and frequency. 

Challenge your thoughts. When they tell you that you need to wash your hands, they are lying. OCD is the great liar. ### Maybe add some coconut oil to your hand wash‚Ä¶ just an idea. You may find it more comfortable then hand lotion. ### My son also obsessively washed his hands to the point of cracks and bleeding. Exposure therapy and medication has drastically reduced this for him. However, he used O‚ÄôKeefe‚Äôs Working Hands cream to soothe the cracks and redness. It works like magic! ### The best thing you can do is not compulsively wash or delay the washing as long as possible. Right now I have signs above all of my sinks with questions like ‚Äúcan you sit with this discomfort a little longer?‚Äù Instead of lotion I do ointment or vaseline using a q-tip to apply only on the spots that are so irritated, but definitely consult a doctor if your hands are really struggling. Also try switching soaps. Maybe try a fragrance free face soap or sensitive skin bar soap, or anything that can be more gentle on your hands. It is so challenging and I‚Äôm sorry you are going through this, but you are definitely stronger than you think you are. Try reading The Mindful OCD workbook as you await your appointment or look into CBT school, so that you can make progress in the meantime. ### Thank you. I really appreciate it! It‚Äôs just v quite difficult with my circumstances at the moment. But I will 100% keep trying! Thank you :) ### Thank you so much! Will definitely try :) ### Thank you!! I will look into it and wishing the best for both your son and yourself. ### I really appreciate your suggestions so much. Definitely going to try the sign you recommended and I‚Äôll most definitely look into that work book.

tjrrv6,"Overcoming Counting OCD Hi there, I‚Äôm curious if anyone has had success overcoming counting OCD, and if so, how long did it take?

For some time, I‚Äôve counted my steps as I walk from one location to another, usually within my house or to/from the car, etc. I count to 8 (lucky number), then start back over‚Ä¶and over‚Ä¶again. It‚Äôs exhausting. Interestingly enough, I don‚Äôt do it as much when I‚Äôm out of my home or in other locations. I seem to need the 8 count when I‚Äôm home going about my daily routines: getting ready in the morning, getting ready for bed, etc.

I‚Äôm currently working though this with my therapist (we‚Äôre heavily into ERP). We just started on Friday, and my homework this week is to count odd numbers steps or basically any number other than my safety/lucky number 8. BUT I still hear myself counting all day long, which is still exhausting.

I‚Äôm curious if anyone had success working through counting OCD, particularly with steps, but I‚Äôm also interested in hearing about it more broadly. Any tips for success?

With gratitude,
bookshoplover",2,2022-03-21 21:40:04-04:00,"My lucky number is 8 too!!! If you get more ideas from your therapist keep me posted OP :) ### Counting games were how my OCD first manifested. As I was walking down the street I would  try and guess the correct number of steps between each slab of pavement. 

If I counted wrong I would incur debt. Then I would have to get the next count right or else the debt kept compounding. 

The consequence of this debt would be something bad would happen to my family. 

When I started Safety OCD Checking I had touching and counting rituals. 

For example when checking the water faucets I would put one hand underneath the nozzle and I would count in odd numbers and odd sets.

So I would say ""one,one,one...off,off,off...12345,54321,12345,54321,12345...""

For example, when checking the water faucets I would put one hand underneath the nozzle and I would count in odd numbers and odd sets.

I would continue like this for everything I checked. 

I eventually got better without changing the rituals. ### ",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tjrrv6/overcoming_counting_ocd/
tj2oos,Do people find the phrase ‚Äúit‚Äôs making me OCD‚Äù or ‚ÄúThis gives me OCD‚Äù offensive ? As someone who‚Äôs clinically diagnosed I find it a little annoying as they don‚Äôt know the actual struggles of the disorder,77,2022-03-20 23:42:47-04:00,"Yes it‚Äôs so annoying. This disorder is already so misunderstood and underdiagnosed ### extremely annoying. i‚Äôve grown up hearing teachers use it to describe themselves. always pissed me off. i even came across someone who constantly described non-ocd shit as ocd. self diagnosed herself with ocd . when asked what ocd stood for, she told me obsessive cleaning disorder. ### soooo annoying dude. like shut up you don‚Äôt have OCD and you‚Äôre fucking lucky you don‚Äôt ### Nothing pisses me off more than this. OCD isn‚Äôt a cute and quirky personality trait. It can destroy a life ### it pisses me off a lot. we never get taken seriously because of people like that

i see people saying ‚Äúi wish i had ocd because i‚Äôm so messy‚Äù or ‚Äúi want a partner with ocd to clean for me‚Äù and it‚Äôs so disgusting like it‚Äôs a debilitating and terrible disease no you don‚Äôt wish for it stfu ### It‚Äôs probably why I never got diagnosed- I didn‚Äôt know what the disorder was ACTUALLY about ): ### Depends on who it is. If they know what I went through then it can. If the person truly doesn't know I don't care. ### Yupp definitely. I had a ""friend"" that would constantly say things like this. It was very annoying. ### It depends 

If they just don't know what ocd is then it's just annoying 

But if they still say it after having it explained then it's offensive ### Not offensive, just annoying as fuck. ### It's incredibly insulting when the person knows all of the torture you went through. ### I clean houses and regularly hear these. Like honey, there's dust on your baseboards and that ""stain"" on the tub floor will come up. I wish my ocd was only a clean house.... ### I hate it for a weird reason. It‚Äôs become so common, and now it‚Äôs common to complain about people misusing it, so I can‚Äôt actually say it. For example, someone handed me trash to throw away and I said I can‚Äôt touch it because of my OCD. They said something along the lines of ‚Äúyou shouldn‚Äôt say that for being a germaphobe.‚Äù I had to explain that I was diagnosed with OCD and I genuinely wouldn‚Äôt be able to force myself to touch what they‚Äôre handing me. ### More like an internal eyeroll and ""you don't know what you're talking about"" feeling. ### It‚Äôs more annoying than it is offensive, I‚Äôve been dealing with it my entire life and I never want people to know that I have it. ### Nope. I don't give a shit whether someone uses that or not as I am aware that mostly people don't use it as a tool of offense. And I don't see why I should waste my time getting all worked up over someone's ignorance/attempt to be funny or whatever when there are worse things out there. If they were doing it on purpose, that's another matter. ### Especially when people say ""my OCD is flaring up"" or ""my ADHD is flaring/raging hard right now."" ### No, because most people don't think it's disrespectful or hurtful. It's not their intention. They are just using a common phrase.

If you say something like ""I have OCD"", you might get an annoying response like ""Oh yeah, I always line up my pencils and wash my hands before I eat"". But generally, if you explain compassionately and nicely that's just popular terminology and that you have the actual clinical version, they will have compassion back and will understand. ### Doesn‚Äôt bother me, I used to use it that way before I knew what it was (and that I had it) and I know it means something else to those without real ocd; they‚Äôre not trying to claim they actually have it they‚Äôre just saying they like thing‚Äôs organized or are a bit perfectionistic

It does make it a bit hard to then tell people I actually have it, but honestly not that hard, a simple explanation or reference to a site about it could fix that ### I don‚Äôt really like it that much, it means they‚Äôre not educated on what having the disorder actually is like. Kinda belittles the experience of the people who actually have it, especially because I would give anything to have my OCD be the way these people think the disorder works. 

I also feel the same way about people saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so bipolar.‚Äù I‚Äôm not diagnosed with it, but still bugs me. ### Nope ### Yes, my friend said, ""I think I'm a little OCD, I love cleaning"". I HATE cleaning. It is the bane of my existence. I have to clean all the time. It consumes so much of my life. My hands are always so raw and bloody. They hurt and itch. If only they knew. ### More of an annoyance, media misusing it for so long definitely didn‚Äôt help so unfortunately most of the world is completely ignorant as to what OCD actually is.

That‚Äôs why I love correcting people who misuse it right then and there and offer a bit of education on the subject. If they‚Äôre receptive, at least that‚Äôs one more person who might be more conscientious about it. If they‚Äôre annoyed instead, that‚Äôs a bridge I don‚Äôt mind burning. Win/win! ### Absolutely. When people say this I‚Äôll ask ‚ÄúOh, you‚Äôre clinically diagnosed?  Me too!‚Äù It usually makes them feel pretty awkward and they‚Äôll limit saying things like that around me. Same with ADHD. ### I don‚Äôt get offended cause I‚Äôm happy they don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs really like & it‚Äôs obvious what their intentions behind saying it are. ### I get a little annoyed, but then I realize they may not realize the impact their words have, or may not be educated on the absolute hell OCD can put you through.  I especially don't like when people associate being organized with OCD.  It's not the same thing and I feel like most of the time that's all people characterize having OCD with.  I've even had people say to me that they ""wish they had ocd"" so that they could have a clean house.  Annoying for sure ### No. Everything doesn‚Äôt have to be so serious, it‚Äôs just a case of semantics, sticks and stones. I don‚Äôt care about peoples opinions enough to be bothered if people using it wrong makes some random ignorant person take it less seriously. Gatekeeping it seems like so much effort, and for what? For the sake of proving that you‚Äôre in more pain than everyone else? To be upset that someone with no knowledge of mental illness is underestimating your condition? Meh. The extent of my suffering doesn‚Äôt have to be understood by anyone but my doctors, idc ### i was diagnosed a few years ago by a psychiatrist. i don‚Äôt feel a strong sense of identity w the diagnosis. i spend at least an hour, rn multiple hours every day on my rituals, and the harder i try not to, the worse it gets. so it is real‚Ä¶ but i don‚Äôt care when people say something makes them a little ocd. they don‚Äôt mean they have a brain issue, they mean something triggers their perfectionism or is annoying. It‚Äôs not the same thing, and they know it‚Äôs not.

If for some reason i thought a person misunderstood the clinical label and couldn‚Äôt be arsed to learn about it, then sure i‚Äôd be annoyed. ### Yeah it‚Äôs frustrating mostly because the context is so cliche. Like I have a clinical diagnosis for intrusive thoughts and they use it to mean I like things clean and organized. But I don‚Äôt get offended. It‚Äôs just like ‚Äúthat doesn‚Äôt mean what you think it does‚Äù ### they wouldn‚Äôt last a fucking day with actual OCD. one girl was literally cleaning out her bookbag and told me she‚Äôs ‚Äúsooo OCD‚Äù, and i went off on her. so goddamn annoying. like shut up ### It‚Äôs extremely offensive. Especially when people imply that OCD is a condition that can simply be turned on and off which is definitely not the case. ### Funnily enough when I was diagnosed I thought they were wrong and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm super messy.‚Äù Stigmas do real damage, I could‚Äôve gotten treatment years earlier if I just would‚Äôve known what it was ### Yes and no. It depends whether the person is purely ignoring and doesn't care or they simply aren't educated on what the disorder is. OCD is so often associated with the ""fear"" of germs, obsessive cleaning and being a ""perfectionist"". 

Most people have no idea what OCD actually entails and that it's much more than that. It annoys me because it's debilitating for me and people going around saying ""omg I'm so OCD because I need everything on my desk to be straight"" or ""I'm OCD because I wash my hands a lot"". 

Then again, I like to keep my cool most of the time and just assume people don't have a clue. A lot of people apologise and are genuinely stunned to hear that it's offensive. ### My one friend who doesn‚Äôt like a messy house says she‚Äôs OCD. Meanwhile I be freaking out over intrusive thoughts and feeling like something bad will happen if I don‚Äôt do something a certain way. Obsessing over things that shouldn‚Äôt matter to the point I question my own worth, and dignity bruh. I tried to explain to her how I felt and she made it about herself. ### Very much. I hate it, i hate myself, i hate the obsessive thoughts, and it‚Äôs so offensive to reduce it to a cute joke about how someone likes to clean their kitchen. ### VERY, people withouth ocd cant understand how offensive that is, and then they laugh about it, because they think it was funny. Wanna see them if they could laugh about it if they start suffering from ocd. ### It‚Äôs annoying and contributes to the stigma that OCD is just being ‚Äúneat and tidy‚Äù but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs offensive, personally. 

People cling onto labels for things and if it people equate being abnormally picky about cleanliness with OCD then they‚Äôre probably just labeling their behavior and not intentionally being offensive. It‚Äôs like when someone calls themselves insane or something. They aren‚Äôt clinically insane but they‚Äôre assigning a label to abnormal behavior/thinking. 

Also I‚Äôve found that calling someone out and accusing them of being ableist or something because they said they‚Äôre ‚Äúso OCD‚Äù generally just makes them annoyed instead of more educated on the subject. ### I‚Äôm annoyed by it, but not offended. There‚Äôs a lot of ignorance surrounding these disorders. Not so long ago, I was the ignorant one. ### Yes, I absolutely hate it ### Yes. And angry. ### Super annoying and offensive. ### I get annoyed when it's used by someone who knows me and knows how I struggle but generally I don't, if that makes sense. Not everyone knows or should know ### I always respond, ‚ÄúOh, you have OCD, too?‚Äù to make them feel uncomfortable lol ### Not offensive at all to me, but certainly a bit annoying!! Pretty sure nobody who says it actually means to offend with it though ### not really offensive but just annoying bc i know thats what they're accustomed to and most times they don't know the real meaning ### Not offensive. It's not really their fault because of how trivialized being ""OC"" has gotten, so I just accept that they don't know what real OCD is. If I had energy to educate them then I'll politely do so, if not then I just move on ### I don't even have ocd and I hate when people say this. It's more of a, ""I'm particular about this"". ### It‚Äôs annoying and frustrating, but I also do understand it‚Äôs hard to fully grasp what OCD is unless you have it. I developed it situationally and didn‚Äôt understand what someone‚Äôs ‚ÄúOCD being triggered‚Äù even meant before then. I was like ‚Äúwhat, does that mean they clean really aggressively?‚Äù (which is the case for some people, but so many symptoms of OCD are misunderstood or unknown). When my anxiety is high, I double-triple-quadruple check doors are locked, tech is unplugged, pets are safe, etc., and can work myself into a panic attack over it. It really impacts my life sometimes, but I could‚Äôve never imagined that before I experienced it myself.

I blame education for not teaching us about the signs and symptoms of mental health issues, not the people who don‚Äôt understand. ### not offended, just annoyed ### Very annoying ### Yes!!!! I have a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù who self diagnoses and whenever something isn‚Äôt in order she says ‚Äúugh this is giving me so much ocd‚Äù even though she HAS NOT been diagnosed with it. It‚Äôs so annoying because she doesn‚Äôt know I have diagnosed OCD and i struggle massively with it. Boils my blood!!! ### Yep it pisses me off because people say it when they‚Äôre being super organised or clean or whatever - that‚Äôs not all it is.  My OCD makes me think I‚Äôve ran over people on my way home and I have to go check. ### It makes me so angry. OCD ruined my entire childhood and any romantic relationship
that I've ever tried to have. If your ""OCD"" is solely just liking to clean things or neatly lining up things, that's not OCD. At all. I would absolutely love to make these people experience the horrifying intrusive thoughts that I did at the age of 10. And the anxiety, paranoia and depression that came with it. ### makes me wish they knew what its like ### Not really offensive.. More like unsettling I‚Äôd say. ### Mildly annoying if anything. It mostly just sucks that it makes it harder for people to recognize actual signs of OCD and get a diagnosis. I didn‚Äôt get diagnosed for years because there is so little public understanding despite affecting  1 - 5% of people. ### It‚Äôs more annoying than offensive, mainly because I think the colloquial use of ocd really contributes to ocd being under diagnosed. ### ahhhh yes it‚Äôs so annoying. it feels inconsiderate ### YES YES YES YES YES YES ### Yeah absolutely. Life for me is a daily battle, im often laying in my bed paralyzed with fear and being unable to function in general, yet people can say stuff like that and get a good giggle. On bad days it usually makes me cry. I wish I had their ‚Äúversion‚Äù of ocd lol. It‚Äôs also really hard not to snap at them. 98% of the time its from a place of ignorance after all. ### It doesn‚Äôt bother me in the slightest.  I know my value, I know what I struggle with, and I know how to conquer it.

Every moment feeling sorry for self is a moment that could be spent working towards bettering oneself.

What intentional exposure have you done today? ### It pisses me off but I wouldn't necessarily use the word ""offensive"" because I think 99% of the usage comes from ignorance as opposed to intentional cruelty or belittling. Sadly even many in the psychology field don't really understand what OCD is so I don't really blame random people for not knowing it, even though the trivializing if it is annoying as hell. ### I wouldn‚Äôt say offensive but it is annoying and people who say it sound uneducated ### Yes. Because it‚Äôs too embedded in everyone‚Äôs lexicon and it lessens the impact of trying to explain that you‚Äôre really struggling, you really can‚Äôt handle xyz. People associate it with quirkiness. I don‚Äôt get angry at individual people for saying it there just needs to be awareness about what OCD really is. ### Nah, I don‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs just ignorance at the end of the day. ### No being offended by shit like that is a waste of energy ### Hahaha bruh ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ ### Makes you want to give them the thoughts in your brain, don't it? Here, have this noisy, paranoid bastard between your ears and tell me all about it. ### such a weird take. i have ocd and im still messy, and i wouldn't trade what i have for an organization compulsion anyway üòê ### Literally so stupid, I refuse to move in with my partner until I have my ocd compulsions related to my living space under control because it‚Äôs not cute. ### Yup yup yup this. I've had people correct me when I reference my OCD because sometimes ""just right"" ocd does fit the stereotype of things being a certain way. They want to correct my ""misuse"" of the term, when really it's just one of the few aspects of my debilitating soul crushing professionally diagnosed ocd that is consistent with the stereotype. ### Right, if they know youre diagnosed and make a point to say it all the time genuinely belittling a diagnosis SAY SOMETHING but if they said something ignorant in an offhand way, if you were uncomfortable SAY SOMETHING. Either way, people aren't mind readers, sometimes they're doing things on purpose and need to be put in their place but usually they just have no idea what's going on in anyone else's life much less mind. ### Agree ### 100% agreed- thanks for putting into words what I couldn't ### *Not offensive at*

*All to me, but certainly*

*A bit annoying!!*

tj8nfr,"I had an epiphany that really helped me, might help you too, it's worth a try saying it So this has turned into a rant, or a wall of text, that I can't be arsed to proofread, and I don't know if it will help or harm anyone, but I guess I'm putting it out there in the chance that it does help one person. IDK if it will get removed or whatever for being bad advice.

**How I used to be**

I used to have pretty bad Pure O, but it's been mostly gone in recent years. It's pretty much gone away without meds or therapy (not saying you shouldn't use those), and I can't exactly tell you how, but I feel that I just got tired of it. Like, why am I doing  this shit? Who cares? I'm sorry that I can't give you guys a further explanation how I got out of it, but my main thought process was ""Lol, this isn't even me, it's literally just some outside bullshit that I'm tired of and I'm going to ignore it"".

**Recently getting back into this garbage, but also having a lot of experience to deal with it**

So I had a few migranes, and it must have depleted my natural serotonin or something because I started getting really worried about like 2 different OCD thoughts. This has happened before after I had a migraine, or sometimes in the middle of the night, but it resolves itself in the morning.

**The epiphany** (well, maybe not for you, but it was an epiphany for me)

My epiphany was as I wrote it in my phone after realizing it: ""**I have full control over my body and actions. I do what I want. If I truly want to do something, then I will do it. If I truly don't want to do something, I won't accidentally do it.** 

I'll add more: I truly don't want to do certain things - therefore I don't need to worry about doing them accidentally, and I don't need to worry about losing control. I don't need to say 'let me make sure I don't do this' or let me concentrate on not doing this'. I just need to decide on not doing it once - and I won't. That's the end of it"".

**My message to you, for example, if you worry about doing something bad.**

I want you to think of that thing. Do you want to do it? Clearly not. So I want you to decide right now. Time to make the decision - not a prediction of what you will do, but the decision of what you are going to do - in sound mind. Will you do it? Yes, or no?

Your answer was no. Thus, you won't do it. 

It is done. Everything is complete. The dilemma is resolved. You no longer need to prevent yourself. You no longer need to think about not doing it. It is done. You already decided ""no"". You literally will not do it.  You have control over your body, it will obey you. Now, stop rumination and rest easy knowing it's impossible.

**Motivation to do stuff**

A while ago, I wanted to get motivated to do some stuff, and I kept thinking of a phrase that stuck with me when I heard it the first time: ""**Motivation is fleeting. Use determination. Go into robot mode. If you truly command your body to do something, it will do it.""** (Now before you ask ""*What if I tell my body to do something bad?*"", if you're so damn worried about accidentally doing something bad, you clearly don't want to do it, so you won't.

If I want to do something creative but sometimes boring like draw, or make music, or just work on something I've been putting off, I don't need motivation. I don't need to have extreme enjoyment in it. I literally just need to do it. I'll draw. I'll work on this. Then I'll stop. Motivation helps, but ultimately, like Shia LeBouf said, just do it.

**How I got back to normal**

My OCD is saying ""What if you do (bad thing)""? And I'm just sitting here laughing at it, as if it's outside of my head, with me saying""Who gives a shit? What if I do this, or that, or whatever the fuck, who gives a fuck?"" And I just have such a relieving laugh at it. I have such relief that I now know this thing is just a little mental disorder that shrinks when I minimize and ignore it and separate it from myself.

Now, I hoped that wall of text helped you. You will eventually get over this crap. I promise. I got over it, you will too. It will get easier. It might get harder before it gets easier, but it will eventually end, and you will feel so free.",12,2022-03-21 06:27:11-04:00,"If you‚Äôve come this far just to see the comments but didn‚Äôt read the wall of text, you should. It‚Äôs helpful stuff. Fair play, OP. ### This was quite helpful OP, thanks for taking the time! ### THANK YOU üíï ### Hey! I came to the same conclusion today. Then I read this post. Thanks great advice! ### How fortunate that you‚Äôve been able to break the cycle! It sounds like you managed to do something that a lot of therapists hope to teach clients ‚Äî giving a sense that one doesn‚Äôt need to do compulsions. When you stop doing compulsions, the obsessions lose their power. And your confidence to stop seems driven but this empowering thought! Nice!

If you have interest, I might look into Jonathan Grayson‚Äôs work. (He‚Äôs a therapist who has specialized in OCD since like the 1970s.) He talks about how we have both environmental and physical triggers that contribute to active OCD. Based on your description, it sounds like he‚Äôd say your physical trigger dissolved over time and it was just habit that had remained. Habit can be strong if you feed it, but if you get sick of it it can become very brittle, and as soon as you break the habit ‚Äî both your physical and environmental triggers are disposed of.

I only say this because I‚Äôve done the same thing ‚Äî went without OCD for ten years after I got tired of it, and then it reappeared ten years later when new physical and environmental triggers appeared. Which, by the way, is perfectly fine. The more I‚Äôve had it, the more I realize OCD really isn‚Äôt scary. I would just say don‚Äôt feel scared if it comes back. You‚Äôve beat it once and, who knows, maybe forever, but if it does ‚Äî you can beat it again, and you have lots of tools to explore still.

Congratulations on your recovery!! :) ### This actually relates to something my therapist told me. He said that the OCD thoughts are just thoughts, and with OCD there's this notion of thought-action fusion, which is the irrational assumption that thinking about doing the bad thing is as bad as doing the bad thing.

He had me imagine throwing a book across the room during a session to show myself that just because I have the thought doesn't mean I'll do it.

However my OCD still persists. I think what you're describing sounds similar to compulsively reassuring yourself, if it isn't then I'm glad its helped for you. A few months back I had a similar epiphany about my OCD and I thought I had overcome it as a result. But I gradually realised it was just a big compulsion that suppressed the anxiety for a bit and I ended up checking that I didn't have the symptoms anymore.

I guess the realisation you came to can be very helpful depending on the person, my therapist did say also that he could go out and get hit by a car with a 'so what' kind of take on it. I had a similar experience about imagining throwing the book with laughing at the thought, but then I also kept thinking about it because I thought it would be funny, harmless and shock the therapist so I kinda wanted to do it. I didn't though.

I still sometimes laugh at some of my intrusive thoughts though and they still stick because there's still anxiety there. But I do think perhaps its because my cognition is still wired that way as I haven't tackled the worst OCD thoughts yet. ### Thank you  üôÇ for the message. ### This is actually very helpful for both my ocd and adhd ### This is fantastic, OP! ### This is awesome!

tjplpa,"OCD compulsions vs OCD tics?? I know that OCD and tourettes/tic disorders are closely linked disorders, and I know OCD can have tics, but what are the difference between OCD tics and compulsions? For me the definitions of the two kind of sound similar (tics are involuntary movements, compulsions can be involuntary movements) so how do you tell the difference between them?

Are all compulsions tics or tics to a degree? Are only some compulsions tics? Are physical compulsions just similar to tics? Is it only a certain type of OCD that has tics? It's confusing me since they have similar definitions",4,2022-03-21 19:50:37-04:00,"I was professionally diagnosed with Tourette's Syndrome at the age of five-years-old, and this is merely my own understanding from what I've read and heard over time. (Most people with Tourette's have OCD, as it's a neurological condition that branches into many mental disorders. Thanks to my Tourette's I have OCD, ADHD, anxiety, depression, and insomnia. I've only ever seen a neurologist however, not a psychiatrist so only time will tell if I have other stuff.)

When I was younger I used to never notice my tics, it was all subconscious. As I've grown, I've been able to feel when they are coming - but I can't stop it or else I can go into a ""tic attack"" where I tic at a rabid rate. Tics are constant, they happen without thinking. Compulsions have a lot more thought behind them. I've never heard of compulsions being an involuntary movement, it's more of a force /compelling/ you to do it. ### So first off I might be completely wrong bc I do not have Tourette‚Äôs nor am I am incredibly educated about Tourette‚Äôs. But I do have OCD and it seems like there is a difference between the two. In OCD compulsions are something we do to calm the anxiety from our obsessive / intrusive thoughts. So we get an intrusive thought or worry, then we do a compulsion to ease the immense anxiety from this worry. So for example if I obsess/ worry that I‚Äôm going to become sick or contract a deadly disease I could wash my hands excessively, shower incredibly frequently, avoid touching ‚Äúcontaminated objects‚Äù, etc‚Ä¶ Another example could be If I have harm ocd and am worried about hurting others. I could avoid sharp objects, sit on my hands, avoid other people etc‚Ä¶ These are involuntary often because the fear of our obsession is so high. However it‚Äôs not involuntary in the way a muscular twitch or uncontrollable bodily movement is (at least for me). I hope this was helpful at providing some examples of compulsions and how the thought process works. ### i don‚Äôt have the answer but i wanted you to know i wonder the same. ### I've already replied to the main thread before but I also wanted to reply here since I really loved your addition! You gave great insight into compulsions that easily showed the difference between the two (that being of tics and compulsions). As a sufferer of both, I was extremely impressed! ### ",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tjplpa/ocd_compulsions_vs_ocd_tics/
tjvtqf,"OCD intrusive thoughts vs GAD intrusive thoughts Hi again! Yesterday or the day before, I made a post asking if my diagnosed GAD seemed to be more than GAD. I have had a suspicion for a couple of months now that it may be OCD and had two people say, hey, this sounds like OCD (I didn't write in my post that I thought I may have OCD) which finally convinced me I have a form of OCD if two people with OCD can relate to my issues. 


SO, I bought a book someone recommended and am about half way through it now, definitely feeling closeness to some of the things I'm reading. However, now (about 24hrs after I originally asked Reddit if I may have more than GAD) I'm thinking I'm exaggerating my issues and maybe only have GAD rather than a form of OCD. I've read lots about intrusive thoughts and see that a lot of OCD/GAD overlap, including intrusive thoughts. 


Are there any key factors that will tell a person whether it's OCD or GAD? Can a person have intrusive thoughts and have it be both at the same time? 


Most of the time, my thoughts are 'omg I grabbed this man who walked by my desk inappropriately' and try to convince myself the rest of the day I didn't do it even though I know I wouldn't or at least I hope I wouldn't. Then spiral into a panic attack, then I can't be around that person without having a panic attack, then I spend hours at home telling myself I didn't do anything and think about all the reasons why I didn't do anything (ie. I didn't get fired, spoken to, etc). But then I think things like, omg what if the person I grabbed actually liked it? Then I'll go into work the next day and be uncomfortable around said person because I may blink inappropriately/flirting with them with my fucking eyeballs. ALSO! I get scared I'm winking at people, so I'll rub my eyes and put my head down. Then I start rubbing my eyes as a coping mechanism to tell myself I didn't wink (I can't even wink properly, why would I wink at someone when I didn't want to lol).


Just a quick add on here, I've been doing some thinking and theres a couple more things I'm not sure if GAD or OCD. When I was a kid, I'd carry my diary to school because I didn't want my parents to see. Then through the day I'd think someone grabbed it out of my backpack, read all of it, then put it back in. Then I'd start having panic attacks when people looked at me weird. This happened in several schools I was in as a smaller child (8-11yrs ish). I knew they didn't, but it caused me so much fear I'd leave school early or eventually have my parents switch me schools. I'm currently 28 and scared to drive because I don't want to kill someone or myself, I get so scared I start blacking out on the road so I stopped driving altogether even though I got my license at 16 and never been in an accident. I also had an incident happen almost 7 years ago when someone harassed me/threatened me (bad like, I'll find you and seriously harm you/pimp you out). SEVEN YEARS LATER I still worth about this frequently. Immediately after it happened, I quit my job, removed hundreds of friends from my Facebook, called the police who did nothing, installed security cameras and didn't leave my house without a wig for almost a year. This many years later, I'm still terrified and can't stop keeping tabs on the person who threatened me.

Edit: I also have minor (I think theyre minor in comparison to how a lot of people have them) thought broadcasting/general paranoia issues, more about this is on my last post if interested. I used to think I *may* have schizophrenia but I truly don't believe I do anymore, thought broadcasting is one of the only symptoms related to schizophrenia I have.",11,2022-03-22 01:33:44-04:00,"I have both gad and ocd. I am diagnosed with both. I think if possible you should see an ocd specialist. Your actions sound like compulsions to me and that‚Äôs pretty much the big difference between the two disorders. Some people with ocd also believe they have schizophrenia. And I went through a period where I had those thoughts too. Especially the thought broadcasting. I hope you can get answers soon. ### I have GAD with OCD symptoms. It's normal with GAD to have other symptoms, also depression, but not have those disorders. It's like you have a lot of disorder A and a little of disorder B. But you will generally have much more of only one of them, not both equally. 

Seeing you're afraid of having OCD or others things is a classic GAD symptom. ### So with GAD, are intrusive thoughts true and with OCD, the thoughts are not true? Maybe i have GAD and not OCD but ive given up to care anymore to  be honest ### So overthinking beyond what could be considered 'regular anxiety' (ie thinking about things for hours, trying to convince myself something didn't happen, etc) would be more on the OCD spectrum? Idk if there's a spectrum I'm still so completely new to this even after all the reading I've done. ### I suffer from both true thoughts and then also thoughts that have the possibility to be true but unlikely and then thoughts that are completely untrue and I have a hard time convincing myself it's not true even though I know its not. 

I don't know for sure if I have OCD or not, I really think that I do and I've thought it for a bit. 

Example of something true: when I was threatened 7 years ago that I cannot for the life of me get over. I keep tabs on said person just to avoid them even though we don't communicate on any level and I know it's better to not do that but I keep finding myself looking to see if they are still in my province. 

Another thing that is true: I won't specify, but something I did that was actually horrible of me to do that I should be able to forgive myself for, but this many years later I can't. 


Possibly true: I grabbed someone sexually at work even though I know I wouldn't do that (but could still happen). 


Completely untrue: people can see my private browsing history on my phone (like people who aren't connected to my wifi or devices at all lol). Another untrue thing, sometimes I'm worried to reach out to people on the phone because I think (even though I know it's ridiculous) that maybe I will be the cause of their death. Ie, I'm worried to call my grandmother because even though me calling her won't make her die, I'm beyond terrified if I contact her she'll be saying her goodbyes and it'll be my fault she dies. Another thing, when I was young and stupid, two guys cheated on their girlfriends with me - over the course of 5 years, both of their girlfriends died so I joke and say I have a kiss of death , but I can't get it out of my head that I might have somehow killed them from a broken heart or something even though I think one died from drugs and the other one caught a bizarre case of pneumonia.

Some of these things have stuck with me for years, other thoughts come and go. Like, if I share my thoughts with my partner, they're sick of me (they're not), then I get embarrassed and can't get over thinking omg they're just with me because they made a promise, not because they actually want to be and then I'll let him know that thought then I traumatize myself for days thinking he doesn't want to be with me even though I know he does. I've read some things that aren't allowed on here so I'll just keep it simple - children scare the crap out of me because I think if I had kids I'd murder them, or when kids scream in public I think about hurting them. They also make me uncomfortable when they're not screaming because they have no boundaries and Im worried what their parents might think if I say or do the wrong thing, children crawling on me makes me want to gag. ### Yeah‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve spent countless hours of my life trying to convince myself that certain things didn‚Äôt happen while my ocd tries to convince me otherwise. Even things that did really happen can ‚Äúhaunt‚Äù me. It‚Äôs called real event ocd. And I‚Äôm not entirely sure about OCD being on a spectrum. You can be diagnosed with either mild or severe OCD sometimes but that‚Äôs all I know.

Whether it be answers to my problem or answers to.. did I really do that? I'm sure I'll have a million more little questions. The more I think about things I've been truly bothered by the more I'm like, that would totally make sense if I had a form of OCD.

The premise is that every person on earth is just a different life of the same being, and that being has to be everyone before it can ascend to godhood or whatever.

tjllu8,"Is this OCD? So many people with OCD say they feel like something bad will happen if they don't do what their OCD tells them. I often have intense compulsions and if I try to resist I start sweating and shaking. The weird thing is that I don't feel like something bad will happen if I don't do it. It just feels like i'm forced.

Many people also say their compulsions are meaningless things like checking things twice or doing something a certain amount of times. I also have that but if I find myself doing them I could stop without any problems.

The compulsions that make me sweat and shake and almost panic if I resist are things that are more negative like deleting data or hurting myself in not so serious ways but for example putting my finger in my eye fast.

I‚Äôve been on a new med the past few weeks so it could be totally related to it, but lately I‚Äôve had thoughts that I don‚Äôt want to get better from my OCD because my OCD is actually the protector in making me actually act out on my intrusive thoughts. 

I‚Äôve had HOCD, self harm and an obsession over yelling inappropriate things in public over the past few years. I‚Äôve always wanted to get better and for the thoughts to go away, but lately every time I think that, OCD comes back with that I don‚Äôt want to get better.",12,2022-03-21 08:57:48-04:00,"I recently started therapy and have been in a bit of a shock so to speak because my therapist already started mentioning different treatment options and referrals (pretty new therapist since that was the only one without a waitlist so I‚Äôm not too surprised to be referred to someone else). 

But this has sent me into a flurry of thinking things like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to get better because if I wanted to I would have already‚Äù ‚Äúwhat if my thoughts are true and I can‚Äôt willingly lose the truth‚Äù etc. I‚Äôm not even diagnosed yet so this might be from other diagnoses or whatever but maybe this is similar to what you‚Äôre experiencing? 

I try to tell myself that I know I am hindering myself by not doing treatments but I do feel sometimes that I should quit everything because I like being like this (like I‚Äôm too afraid of my fear going away from treatment then I‚Äôll do the things that are scary now) kind of ridiculous üòÇ ### Bro my OCD is not completely but almost disappeared. Every fkin day I had thoughts about im monster, about suicide, every OCD thought u can possibly think about. Never talk about that to anyone. Maybe 4 months im without this shit. Sometimes it comes back for like an hour, fear, fkin stupid thoughts but i learned how to control it. Now I just say that it's just OCD so don't worry try to clear my mind and it goes out of my head. Except for some problems with anxiety, perfectionist stuff and tics im finally happy with it. All i wanna say is that it is possible just never fking give up cuz i had so bad mental conditions i ever have so fkin deep depression, anxiety, living with the feeling that in monster and now i can say a can fkijg control this shit. Never give up bro!!!!! ### Maybe a little, I feel maybe more like it‚Äôs easier to be like this and live with OCD than trying to get to know the ‚Äùnew me‚Äù - me without OCD. I don‚Äôt know who I am without this since it‚Äôs always been there. ### Yeah I swear it is like that i thought i was the only one it feels like i like it even though it had made my life living hell ### Yes, but mostly no. I want to improve my health, but afraid I would become too comfortable, I feel like I am getting protected by my ocd from threats. ### Yep totally understand. Another theme I‚Äôve had lately is that I want to act out on these intrusive thoughts so it‚Äôs not really OCD, it‚Äôs actually how I feel. Even though I‚Äôve been diagnosed for about a decade now, have been on meds and in ERP, OCD is trying to convince me now all the sudden that I don‚Äôt want to get better or fear the consequences of acting out on these thoughts.

So far I was able to talk (???) with the voice once, I was at my bed, and I heard it shouting something. I thought ‚Äúwhat?‚Äù, wanting it to repeat what it ‚Äúsaid‚Äù, and then it shouted something else then disappeared. What the hell is this??? Am I going insane?

I no longer hear the voice as I got older and my ocd changed/progressed/changed over time.

tjl3z9,"I need support to help my wife who suffers from OCD I am in a mess. My wife whom I love and have been married to for 21 years has suffered from scrupulosity OCD since she was a teen. She also has body dysmorphia. She can't stand the way certain clothes feel on her and will take forever to get ready to leave the house. She gets regular weekly therapy from NOCD and her psychiatrist (monthly)

She managed the symptoms somewhat throughout raising 3 kiddos. She has been on a boat load of different medications and therapy, but the past 3 years has been very hard on our marriage. She has been doing therapy with NOCD and it seems to have really brought her into her head even more and making things inflamed beyond belief. She can be extremely mean to me and say thing that I can't believe she is saying. She will snap out of it later and apologize, but it still stings bad in my heart. 

She fantasizes about cutting herself all the time. She will act on it and then try to hide the cuts, but that doesn't work because I see her naked at times. 

I constantly walk on eggshells because almost everything triggers her and can put her in a tail spin. Thankfully she does not have to work and we are financially able to make it on my salary alone. She would not be able to hold down a job even if she was put in a position to need extra income. 

I am desperate for my own help and support. I feel like I am losing my wife and my own mind. Can anyone point me to a support group for spouses? Hell, I would even pay to get support. 

Many, Many thanks!",6,2022-03-21 16:25:08-04:00,"Thank you so much for the love and care you shared surrounding your wife. My OCD was tremendously hard on my partner. I took things out on him and could say mean things too. I never meant any of it, but the OCD was unbearable (not an excuse). There was a moment we both broke down because he felt like he was losing me and I felt like I had lost myself. The best thing he could do for me was to love me and show care, but to never enable my OCD. He found the book When a Family Member has OCD very helpful. OCD Peers also might have a weekly group for supporters of people with OCD. We also found it helpful for him to get involved in my ERP homework, so that we could feel like a team instead of in opposition. My OCD was horrible and it still is incredibly hard. I know that being a loved one can be exhausting and you might not get gratitude, but having support people as we struggle is, so helpful. Don‚Äôt forget to prioritize taking care of yourself and setting boundaries (you don‚Äôt deserve to be a human punching bag), so that you can love your wife and support her in this moment the way you want to. ### I have the same problem of needing support. It‚Äôs my son, not a spouse. It is extremely difficult to live with someone with OCD. It‚Äôs frustrating and exhausting. I know he can‚Äôt help it but I lose my temper at times because he leaves paper towels all over the house from hand washing and not being able to touch things if I‚Äôve touched  them. He sees a therapist weekly and they work on exposures. He was recently increased to 200 mg of Zoloft and 2 mg of Abilify. His intrusive thoughts are also debilitating to him to the point he is failing 11th grade. He can‚Äôt focus and some days he can‚Äôt get in the car to go to school. You are not alone in living with this. The parents and spouses of people w OCD also need therapy before we lose our shit. I am looking for a therapist to help me deal with my child‚Äôs illness. ### Thank you for replying and sharing your story.  I honestly don't know what she feels. I only see how she acts and from the limited reading I have done on OCD. I wished my wife would let me into her world. She shuts me out. I get so frustrated and anxious because of this. It's like watching a car with your loved one in it on fire, but they don't want you to help pull them out. Maybe a bad analogy, but it sure feels like it. I just want to be there for her, but I just get pushed away. ### I am sorry you are in the thick of it also. I honestly have no idea of how much they suffer, but I do see it from the outside and it is just sad to me. My wife also was on those medications and it didn't have any effect on her. I have a very hard time trying not to  fix it. Anytime I do, it backfires on me in a spectacular fashion. I have to sit from the outside and just watch her be miserable. She becomes very secluded and hides from me and our 3 children. I feel lonely and sad because my wife does not want me to be there for her. ### I hear that. My partner described it as watching me walk into oncoming traffic, so your analogy makes sense to me. I‚Äôm curious if your wife might be open to you meeting with her therapist without her present. Maybe you could phrase it as you want to figure out the best ways to support her and also want to find support for yourself as you navigate this alongside her. I definitely recommend reading as much as you can to educate yourself on OCD. It can be super helpful to have a deeper understanding. You making this post and your commitment to being there is, so valuable, and when she is ready she might let you in more. Definitely look into OCD Peers support group for loved ones of someone with OCD. It seems like having a community that understands what you are going through could be super helpful. I will see if my partner has any additional advice. ### He also mentioned that we are in couples therapy and our couples therapist is familiar with the ocd and how it impacts our relationship. Some people might be more open in a space with a third party or therapist ### ",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tjl3z9/i_need_support_to_help_my_wife_who_suffers_from/
tjps84,"Is this onset of OCD? I (F22) have mixed depressive anxiety disorder according to my psychiatrist who diagnosed me upon seeing me and talking to me at our first session. I got antidepressants (sertraline) and it helped with my anxiety but now I suspect I might have symptoms of OCD. I have very bad intrusive thoughts about dying of cancer or covid, have debilitating fear of driving a car for the same reason, I keep worrying about being attracted to my brother or dad and stuff like that. I need constant reasurance from my mother as I ask her if she loves me, sometimes multiple times a day. I have to prepare my words before I speak in class or when buying a bus ticket and I keep rehearsing it in my mind. I count my cash multiple times to check if its enough. And to actually feel somewhat calm I love to clean the house, especially organizing and sorting clothes and food on the shelves, brooming and other chores. I do it anytime I feel on edge which is almost nonstop. Is this OCD? Is this just anxiety? I am honestly confused and I don't know if I should ask for a diagnosis. What if I don't have it? Then everyone would think I just made stuff up for attention...help",4,2022-03-21 19:59:37-04:00,"You‚Äôre not making anything up. A professional diagnosis is the best option to put a name to whatever it is, but whatever name your condition has it is causing you distress and that‚Äôs the main thing that needs sorting and whether OCD or not it can be treated. Good luck to you. ### I‚Äôm not a psychiatrist and can‚Äôt diagnose you properly but I‚Äôve done my fair share of OBSESSIVE research with my (OCD fuelled) mental health theme. I can recall now what is obviously OCD behaviour from back when I was about 12. I have since then developed depression and anxiety which, with out a doubt stemmed from my OCD. Now, what you describe are all symptoms associated with OCD but their just as much associated with anxiety. Constant reassurance from companions, checking money to reassure your self and rehearsing things to make sure your not embarrassing your self are all your attempts to calm your anxiety. I also do many of these things and they actually started when I developed anxiety and weren‚Äôt very noticeable with my early OCD days. Intrusive thoughts are common with OCD but also occur to neurotypical people and are very common with disorders like anxiety. Finally it‚Äôs also worth considering that depression and anxiety can cause OCD like symptoms. From what you‚Äôve said I can‚Äôt instantly see anything that stands out to me as enough to consider OCD. However, I would recommend you bring these things up with a psychiatrist as someone trained is definitely more useful than I am. Hope this helps ### You're not making anything up. If it causes you distress, it's real ‚Äî and even if you did it ""for attention"", there's a reason you need the attention in the first place. I'd recommend talking to your therapist (if you have one) and to your psychiatrist about the symptoms you've been facing, as no one but a professional can give you a proper diagnosis. Best of luck! ### Yes ### ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tjps84/is_this_onset_of_ocd/
tjkm57,"SCHIZ OCD WEIRD SYMPTOMS HELP!! I am literally so scared and I know reassurance isn't a good thing for people who suffer from OCD but I need some because Im about to check myself in because I am so worried. In January, my psychiatrist told me I wasnt developing schizophrenia but I still think I am in the prodrome stages so thats why I have insight. 

for the people who suffer with Schizophrenia OCD, do yall ever get formication? the feeling of bugs crawling on your skin or do yall get the feeling of your thigh burning at night. Of course I know there aren't bugs crawling on me but the feeling is so strong it scares me. I have been diagnosed with anxiety and OCD and they can cause formication but I feel like my formication is due to schizophrenia ): its like my OCD tries to find a new symptom for me to be scared of.. can someone please respond, I am scared. I have been afraid of schizophrenia for the past year and a half, I think about it daily",21,2022-03-21 16:02:55-04:00,"You are worried that you are not normal. What is not normal is spending every day for 18 months worrying that you are not normal. ### I have this theme so chuck me a pm if you need to chat. ### I am nervous and have ocd and get that crawls feeling too.  It‚Äôs not schizophrenia ### I have been diagnosed with Paranoid Schizophrenia for 30 years. I have been diagnosed with Safety OCD Checking for 20 years.

Since you have insight into the symptoms of Schizophrenia and both you and your doctor are aware of your concerns about developing this mental illness. I think you are well placed to catch the symptoms early should you develop Schizophrenia.

This insight is actually a great asset for you.

Even if you did have Prodrome Schizophrenia when you look at you on a timeline, one and a half years of concern is a long time to be worried about nothing (at the moment.) To be honest, if you were Prodrome all these 18 months then I reckon it would have developed into full-blown Schizophrenia by now.

Hope this helps. ### If you had shchizophrenia you'd think the bugs were real which you don't so try to relax (sorry for crappy advice) ### If you use cannabis or other hemp products, a slight body buzz can produce moving tingling sensations that might be possible to confuse with that sensation. ### Dude its the anxiety making you doubt things. Weird noises become something to check, a random nerve quirk becomes a bug etc. ### I have schizophrenia ocd, It‚Äôs lessening each day and I remember moments when it was really really bad where I was panicking thinking I had schizophrenia, my brain would remind me of all the symptoms of schizophrenia and the skin crawling was one of them. 
I remember panicking so much thinking ‚Äúomg it‚Äôs happening‚Äù and so I would continue panicking that I could feel my skin crawling even tho i knew it wasn‚Äôt lol, I would pull at my jumper and shirt and want to change it because it felt so uncomfortable. 

What I did to stop this was to sit, remain calm and rationalise with this thought. Remember it‚Äôs more than likely anxiety and OCD and nothing more, everyone can feel they‚Äôre skin crawl from time to time. For example, someone who hates insects or spiders and they might watch a video or see a bug crawl and they would freak out and think as if the bug is on them. Even writing this post right now just thinking about my skin crawling is actually making me think it lol, it‚Äôs just your brain tricking you. Just remember you are okay and you will get through this rough patch soon ! Keep speaking with your therapist and work through this theme. Out of all the themes i have experienced throughout my life this theme has been the hardest and the strongest one to battle and I‚Äôve experienced nearly every symptom of it, you will be okay. ### I know ): I dont want to worry each day but I am so scared that I am developing schizophrenia that it causes me to worry 24/7 ### Do you suffer from schiz ocd? ### Thank you for responding. I hate that I worry and obsess over it each day, it honestly sucks but I am trying my best to accept that maybe I will develop schizophrenia but its been hard. ### Wait, so people with formication think the bugs are real? I def dont think that ### I don‚Äôt smoke so I don‚Äôt think it could be that ### I know, I just didnt think anxiety could cause all this. I just found out about Schizophrenia OCD in January. Last year I really was convinced it was over for me but im so glad to see other people go through the same thing ### Thank you so much for this response. Schizophrenia OCD is awful and has robbed me of my joy for the past year and a half. I still love life and enjoy it but im just always worried that any little beep or noise is the beginning of psychosis and that I am about to hallucinate and snap. I have been learning/trying to sit calm and rationalize with the thought of maybe I am psychotic, maybe im not and its scary but I realize thats what I have to do if I want to overcome Schizophrenia ocd. If you dont mind me asking, how long have you been suffering from Schizophrenia OCD? ### [deleted] ### I really empathize with you on this. I suffer with obsessions for years and every time its like the end of the world. My father was diagnosed with bipolar with schizophrenic tendencies or something along those lines, and he was completely out of touch with reality where as you are totally aware of what is going on with your body so in my eyes it is very unlikely you are schizophrenic, I have had similar vivid sensations and even mild hallucinations due to paranoia/anxiety so it might be that. My advice is to answer your brain with ‚Äúmaybe maybe not‚Äù when you worry about being schizophrenic and learn to sit with uncertainty. I am also trying to practice this but it‚Äôs very difficult. I learnt it from a YouTuber who is a registered therapist, youtube surprisingly has great therapy content. Best of luck friend. ### Ye you can still think rationally and you realise its just a sensation not actually bugs which would indicate you aren't psychotic to me. I'm not a doctor tho. ### you overcame it when you stopped obsessing? ### Thank you for this response. I always convince myself I have a major health issue and I usually am able to get over them but this one I cant seem to shake. Schizophrenia OCD has taken over my life and its scary the brain can create symptoms that mimic schizophrenia. Everyone always say that if you have insight into schizophrenia its a indicator that you dont have it so thats what I try to remind myself of. Have you gotten over the obsession or do you still struggle with it? and I am going to look the therapist up now ### Yeah the sensation feels like bugs but I know there aren‚Äôt actual bugs on me ### Just to clarify, i don‚Äôt actually obsess about wether i have schizophrenia or not, what i meant is my obsessions last for YEARS. I still haven‚Äôt fully managed to get over some of them, usually my brain gets bored and finds something else. A never ending cycle really. Medication and therapy helped me a lot despite having relapsed into ocd several time due to highly stressful/traumatic events, my brain just reverts to ocd mode. CBT and ERP are very beneficial as well as mindfulness tactics like breathing exercises and progressive muscle relaxation, which you can do on your own or with an audio/video to guide you. A new technique I learned from my ocd therapist is using the mammalian diving reflex. Putting a cold wet cloth over your eyes and plugging your nose (while breathing through your mouth) triggers this diving reflex which lowers heart rate. It works great for me personally. Good luck friend! ### ",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tjkm57/schiz_ocd_weird_symptoms_help/
tjpbhw,"Wondering if bf is gay I‚Äôm wondering if my(F) boyfriend is gay. Let me make it very clear that if this is the case I would be completely ok with it and would let him go, it‚Äôs just the uneasiness of potential break up is killing Mrs.

We dated for 6 years now and there‚Äôs some things that suggest to this. Not only does he make a lot of peoples gaydars go off (this guy at a club thought for sure he would realize he‚Äôs gay later and bf told me about it later- hell I thought he mightve gay at first), he tends to have mostly female friends, acts a bit effeminate, has tried wearing dresses, joined an LGBTQ club in college, can be really close female friends but doesn‚Äôt find it flirty (eg carrying other girls, going w them one on one to bars, sharing drinks, complimenting them openly on social media, said he hates men, didn‚Äôt finish at all our first time, takes pretty long to finish w me (only does like 1/2 the times), has a gay alter ego, used to do anal w pens when younger, has a pride flag in room, thinks gay guys are cool (which is true and also I haven‚Äôt heard him talk about any other group like that) , finds fem boys attractive, explored trans and aromantic (maybe he isn‚Äôt attracted to me Bc he‚Äôs gay?), doesn‚Äôt touch me much initially when we meet (may also be due to past trauma though), said he would feel better about himself as a white female, prefers grinding w his bottom on me, has liked a ‚Äúpeck‚Äù from a gay guy at a party (he said he just felt good to be included cause the guy was doing that to everyone), and often calls himself hot. He hasn‚Äôt tried anything with guys yet though so we don‚Äôt know

Things that suggest he may not be gay is that most/ all but one of his crushes in the past have been female, he mainly watches women/ straight porn, he does get hard every time we meet (but could that be classical conditioning?), he finished really quick the one time we didn‚Äôt use a condom (but he could‚Äôve just like the sensation?), and he gives me a lot of attention whenever I‚Äôm naked (which is also something cause usually he doesn‚Äôt give me a lot of attention in normal conversation

Our relationship is an interesting one because we have traumatized each other in the past but we are trying to improve, and I‚Äôm also aware that I‚Äôm being obsessive rn and I do have OCD but I guess I just want some guidance because this anxiety may not completely be invalid. I am not interested in breaking up unless it‚Äôs truly the only thing I can do, I would appreciate solutions or how to approach this in other ways a lot more. 

I‚Äôm also anxious cause I keep reading and hearing about stories where the guy doesn‚Äôt realize he‚Äôs gay until like 40 or later which is cool and I‚Äôm happy for him but I would also hate to be living a lie and would probably hate myself for not realizing the signs/ putting it together earlier",3,2022-03-21 19:36:35-04:00,"Girl, run.

tje7to,"Thoughts Hi, is it normal with ocd to distract yourself from thoughts by keeping busy, you can actually feel happy and that everything will be ok. And then as soon as you are left alone with your thoughts they spiral out of control and you feel horrible? This happens up and down throughout the day. Would really appreciate any feedback.",3,2022-03-21 11:20:17-04:00,"For me, I found it helpful to learn about the mind from a neuroscientific perspective. When you're working on a task that requires some concentration your Executive Control Network is engaged. When your mind is given some down time, say by relaxing or doing something repetitive and boring like the dishes, then your Default Mode Network takes over. The DMN has tighter ties to areas of your brain that process fear/anger and autobiographical memories. The DMN is also active when you think about yourself, and so having down time or doing something boring leads into thinking about yourself. You'll start dredging up all kinds of memories, anxieties and ruminations. It sucks. I kind of get stuck there.

Once I knew this, however, I saw I could recognize patterns and when I was falling into rumination. I can't stay busy forever but grounding & mindfulness helps me maintain focus and executive control. Learning about the mind from a neuroscientific perspective also explained not only why mindfulness helps but also how meditation works (you're exercising your executive mind) and how practicing meditation regularly strengthens your ability to maintain executive control rather than falling into rumination. I kind of thought meditation was BS prior to this because I didn't understand the mechanism behind it.

Anyway, easier said than done & there's a lot more detail to it but the basics works for me. ### You arent alone. OCD is a beast.  Anyway i use deep breathing and grounding techniques when im alone and my OCD acts up.  I hope you find ways to manage it.  Best of luck! ### Yeeeesss. 

Sometimes I have easier ‚Äùseasons‚Äù, like I even think (obsessively ofc) that I‚Äôve been faking my whole life about OCD and tics that I coul just stop if I wanted to. That this is normal and everyone else is weird because they are not doing what I do, etc. Obviously I can‚Äôt stop, takes a few days for me to realize that this was yet another OCD thought. 

During bad season, I have multiple compulsions and tics every minute of the day and I have to keep myself busy to distract myself from them. I fill my calendar with things to do and places to go and if I have free and/or alone time, I watch tv shows or scroll facebook, anything to keep my thoughts away from OCD stuff.

The main thing is these things are usually illegal, and my brain uses this as a way to justify the obsessive need to confess. I am suffering immensely so any advice would be very appreciated.

tjtany,"Diagnosed ADHD, but I suspect I also have OCD, or something similar. Please hear of my insatiable ""writing & editing"" habit, and provide any thoughts and insights: Today, with a filthy house needing deep-cleaned, I've spent SIX HOURS meticulously editing and refining my Instagram Bio, and a Facebook post about my new cat. 

I'm aware that 6 hours of procrastination is  hallmark ADHD, but I could've found several ways to kill 6 hours on my phone; it's my selected route that has me concerned, when I could've easily found something to binge on Netflix or Youtube.

Today, I spent SIX HOURS typing/editing 2 things: 

A) a 150-character Instagram bio for my business

and

B) 3-paragraph introduction of my newly acquired cat, posted to facebook.  




This is not irregular for me.  I've foregone entire nights of sleep, and missed subsequent days of work, because I cannot stop refining my written words -- be it a private journal entry, a facebook post, or a *literal* short-story I weave in response to a text message; knowing the 'pay-off' will, *at best,* be something along the lines of: ""uhhh....... where the f___ did that come from?""  

I'll spend 50+ 'takes,' on a simple video-explaination to a colleague, until my words and demonstrations are perfectly ""efficient,"" and I'm painting the absolute clearest picture I can, while finding how to do so in the fewest words possible.  (Palpably ironic that i'll blow 50 takes in the name of efficiency / palpably ironic that I used the word ""efficient,"" and then unnecessarily continuing, trying to clarify, but only simply stating the definition of ""efficient.""

If I wanna share a neat little guitar riff on Instagram, another 50+ takes. 

I'll even rewrite a 'To-Do' list 7 or 8 times, and then go days without addressing a single task on it....

When I worked at the airport, I would show up late to my assigned flights because I was stuck practicing my signture, filling several pages, front and back.  (This tidbit was added in my FINAL edit of this post [see below], placing me at just over the 1hr mark on this post. My cat asked to be fed when I first started and I told myself I' get to her as soon as I'm done.  My house asked me to clean it up yesterday morning.)  

What is wrong with me?




(I've spent 32 minutes on this post, deleting/rewriting paragraphs, with not one crucial detail added that was previously left-out.) 

(I wrote that when I *thought* I was ready to submit, 9 minutes ago.)

(Hi, Me again. It's been 45 minutes on this post if I can manage to submit within the minute.)

(didn't leave this section since last update.  Continuing, to explain that I'll update you if I don't make it within 2m [now 1m])

(i'm chuckling to myself at all of this, and i bet it *is* funny, but I'm now realizing that I DON'T want to be doing this because I think it's 'funny,' 'or ironic, or 'meta.'  I literally get so caught-up like this, and I didn't really mean to demonstrate exactly what it looks like when I get lost doing this, but I suppose it serves your best understanding.)

(Didn't make the 2-minute gap. Went over. Now forcing myself to bail out and hit 'post.' Refusing to 'proof-read' upon finishing this sentence. (I said that but then took 3 more passes at this paragraph. [make it *4* more])

I don‚Äôt have ADHD, so I can‚Äôt say if what you‚Äôre describing would also fit under the hyper-focus umbrella of ADHD, but it is one of the ways ocd manifests for me.

Doing ERP for this is harder for me than some of the previous obsessions I‚Äôve worked through because it‚Äôs so automatic for me to reread/rewrite or restart a recording for a work task. I have a hard time catching myself before engaging in the ritual, especially if it‚Äôs digital. Although it feels awful, it‚Äôs a little easier to catch myself when I‚Äôm about to rewrite a list by hand. ### it's so relieving to hear that at least 1 other person goes through this lol

What is ERP? Exposure therapy?  How does one ""expose"" themselves to something like this? Could you share that process looks like in your case? ### Exposure and response prevention. For something like this, you would intentionally draft a list/email/FB post or record a video, but not allow yourself to reread/rewrite/re-record. Then you let yourself feel the anxiety and discomfort that comes up. 

For me, there isn‚Äôt a fear that something bad is going to happen, it just feels ‚Äúwrong‚Äù or ‚Äúnot quite right,‚Äù and I need to keep redoing it until it feels ‚Äúright.‚Äù It‚Äôs like I have criteria that it needs to meet (like you were saying about efficiency), but the criteria are subjective, so it just keeps going until I feel settled about it. Even after I reach a point where I feel settled enough to send it, I‚Äôll frequently go back to review it because I start to feel uncertain about whether it was actually clear enough.

There‚Äôs a YouTube channel called OCD and Anxiety that does a good job of explaining ERP with examples for different types of obsessions/compulsions. https://youtube.com/c/ocdandanxiety ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tjtany/diagnosed_adhd_but_i_suspect_i_also_have_ocd_or/

tjh19h,"Those who got to be ""almost recovered"" from OCD, how did you make it to ""fully recovered""? Although conventional ERP saved my life and got me to where I am now I feel kinda stuck with the amount of time I spend ruminating still.

It feels like that 20-15% left to feel totally recovered is so close yet so far.

I stumbled across the work of Dr Greenberg in this sub. Everything he says sounds like the right next step for me to kick it in the balls but wanted to know if someone else has been in a similar situation and what actions they took.
I cant book appointments with Ocd associates cuz im not us based but I feel like the tools he/ his website provide are useful in itselfs at this point down the road (lots of knowledge about ocd, less distressing manifestations... etc)

(Note: I will not use at this point any medication or any other therapy that is not at least as evidence based as ERP, with the exception of NR-ERP)

Thanks a lot. Hope your answers helps others too.",4,2022-03-21 13:25:31-04:00,"I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm almost recovered, only because of a couple lingering habits as well as Real Event ocd. It‚Äôs much easier to get past normal ocd with medication and working with intrusive thoughts because they‚Äôre irrational and you know that. But with real event, it‚Äôs something that actually happened, which forms trauma and makes it much harder to get past without trauma therapy. ### Consistently doing exposures and living an exposure lifestyle. Not giving into OCD even if it says just this one time because that can quickly escalate. I am almost 3.5 years ocd free ### I have been diagnosed with safety OCD checking for 20 years but have been on top of it for about 15 years. I use to be in and out of bed in the middle of the night checking and rechecking my bathroom water faucet were off. I use to worry about the stove catching fire as well as a multitude of other symptoms. I even broke my front door key in half from constantly unlocking and relocking it.

In my lifetime I have only ever done one ERP technique in my entire life. And it really helped. But to be honest I own my recovery to memory systems. These memory systems help me to remember that what I have checked is safely off, locked, and closed.

I still check a lot but the compulsive checking no longer has me. I check for a total of 5 or so minutes a day. And I no longer get out of bed constantly during the night. Part of my memory system involves attaching specially coded images to my body when checking. Should I worry about the faucet (or anything else), all I do is a quick body scan to the body part that has the information (the specially coded image) on it which reminds me it has been checked properly.

I was harshly judgmental about it (they would boast of where they went to school and how smart they are and how they had a job lined up for after graduation and would talk about how they didnt read).

It wasn't until I understood that they were OCD that I  could really defeat them. I still struggle a bit with the n word thing but it is getting better.

If I get an intrusive thought I think, okay, thanks brain, you're looking out for me and want me to not do something horrible. And then I think, okay, so what happens if I did throw grandma off the roof? She'd die, I'd go to jail, that would suck. I would hate it. Might even kms. Ok. Thanks brain!


For whatever reason that just sucks the wind right out of all those thoughts. Like logically I'm not gonna chuck grandma off the balcony, I know that. But my brain just wants to double triple check that I wouldn't, and wants to check what would happen if I *did* for some reason do it, so okay, I'll humor you brain, thanks for telling me.


People say to starve the OCD, to avoid reassurances about intrusive thoughts. This is different than a reassurance, it doesn't feed the ridiculous thought, it just says 'k thanks bye' to the thought and then your brain doesn't have to keep screaming it at you.



It might help to picture your OCD as an overly concerned parent. Like your OCD is in your head like 'be careful you'll fall down and dieeee' and if you just tell that parent 'hey thanks!' they'll shut up and quit squawking warnings at you ### Oh, I also would put my head down as a kid anytime we stopped at a red light.

tjd77q,"How is it OCD if I‚Äôve actually done something morally wrong When I was 14 I was talking to an online friend of mine. They mentioned they had their cat across their lap. I asked to see an image of their cat on their lap. In reality, though, it was just an excuse to see a picture of their legs. A couple years after this, upon remembering it, I was of course deeply disgusted with myself. They didn‚Äôt give me consent to view their body in that manner. I‚Äôm fairly certain that this - getting someone to send you something like that with the pretense of something innocent, when in actuality you‚Äôre doing it for that purpose without their knowledge or consent - counts as assault under some definitions.


I‚Äôll admit, I posted about this for reassurance one time on an old account. But in the same post I‚Äôd listed a bunch of stuff that, rationally or not, I felt like I‚Äôd done wrong, so I didn‚Äôt get a response to anything specific, just a blanket ‚Äúit‚Äôs fine!‚Äù. Nonetheless, though, I took it as ‚Äòoh it‚Äôs just ocd then‚Äô and moved on. But every so often it crops up in my head again and I just can‚Äôt! I just can‚Äôt believe it.


Before you dismiss me as reassurance, please at least listen to my reasoning. I still talk to this person. I‚Äôm 18, almost 19 now, but still - don‚Äôt they deserve to at least know? Should I not be expected to take the most minimal amount of accountability and tell them so I can at least face some sort of consequence for it? I feel as if I‚Äôm lying to them, and to anyone who knows me but doesn‚Äôt know about this, which is everyone I know personally.


Even if that is true, I‚Äôm a coward. I wouldn‚Äôt be able to. Even if I did, and was forgiven, or whatever, I don‚Äôt know. I still feel like I wouldn‚Äôt be able to move on. Just knowing that there‚Äôs good people out there who‚Äôve never done stuff like that and I‚Äôm not one of them. I‚Äôve done a nasty thing to someone and I can never undo it, and what‚Äôs more, I don‚Äôt even have the courage to let them know and face up to the harm I‚Äôve done. Even if I‚Äôve changed from then and wouldn‚Äôt do it again, the fact that I‚Äôd ever done it would be enough to make many people understandably suspicious/hostile towards me as a precaution.


The person who gave me reassurance, I‚Äôm seriously starting to question them. Cause I don‚Äôt understand how I should just be ‚Äòlet off‚Äô from something like that. There‚Äôs at least one person out there who‚Äôd disagree with that notion and I‚Äôd be hard-pressed to tell them they‚Äôre wrong.


Up until now I‚Äôve been running on the logic of ‚Äúthis is all in your own head .. the only time you‚Äôve ever got another actual human‚Äôs input they said it was fine‚Äô. And I should just run with that. But I can‚Äôt. I just can‚Äôt see logically how that‚Äôs justified. I‚Äôm sorry. I feel like I‚Äôm just in denial that this is all reassurance but it‚Äôs been years and no matter how much I ignore it never goes away.",3,2022-03-21 10:34:24-04:00,"My OCD is also all about real things. OCD is about having a sticky brain. If that experience happened to me, I‚Äôd probably have forgotten about it by now. It wouldn‚Äôt matter to me. 

Your OCD is telling you to obsess over it. Even if you confess, your OCD will find something else to obsess over. The goal of treatment is making your brain less sticky, not resolving a single scenario. 

Maybe you did do something wrong. Everyone has. Playing this moment again and again won‚Äôt change what happened and is only harming you. ### OMG! You saw someone's legs! How horrible! I mean, legs! 

Well, you wanted reassurance, so...

You say you don't see how this is OCD. This is entirely OCD. Classic. Your mind took an infinitesimally minor thing and made it seem like the end of the world. That is exactly how OCD works. Then you made it so much worse by doing compulsions, notably ruminating and also reassurance seeking.

This only seems like a big deal because you are fixated on it. Let it go and in time it will be forgettable. ### Exactly this! The best thing to do when your brain is telling you ""confess"" or ""seek reassurance"" is to *not* do that. No one is always right 100% of the time, in words or actions. It's completely normal to grow and learn from things we did wrong in the past. OCD just really likes to criminalize us or make us stick to that one issue or memory. ### ",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tjd77q/how_is_it_ocd_if_ive_actually_done_something/

tirp5q,"OCD urge to ""figure out what's wrong w/me"" and ""heal myself"" My biggest OCD theme is trying to find out/figure out/discover what's ""wrong"" with me and then heal it. It ties into me wanting to be/be seen as a ""good"" person. Whether it's a physical illness, mental illness, spiritual deficit, or moral deficit, I try so hard all the time to be a ""better"" person. I read tons of articles and self-help books, both scientific and spiritual in order to ""find the thing""that'll change me once and for all. Is this an OCD theme you think? I've battled most all the OCD themes at some point or another in my life (besides contamination) but THIS ONE is by far the one that is most profound and the one that's basically been ongoing since I was a kid (I'm 23 now). Can people relate to this?",35,2022-03-20 14:39:41-04:00,"I can definitely relate. I'm in this endless loop of trying to find out what triggered me, why I have the thoughts, and some solution. Forever in this journey of just trying to figure out why and the formula to solve it. ### Makes sense. OCD is just one big alarm system on a loop telling your brain on repeat ‚Äúsomething‚Äôs wrong, we need to fix this‚Äù. ### This reminds my of Moral Scrupulosity OCD. To me it feels like a checking compulsion to validate and reassure yourself that you are a good person :) I do it ALLL the time (ESPECIALLY compulsive googling) ### I don't know if it's OCD related, but I do the same. ### What‚Äôs up I‚Äôm 24 and I‚Äôve been diagnosed with OCD, as a result of my PANDAS (Pediatric Autoimmune Neurological Disorder Attributed to Strep, my entire life. 
I have the exact same thought process. Was literally doing it when I read this post. Someone on here posted an excellent link so that‚Äôs probably better information. 
Anyway, it feels like you‚Äôre always trying to ‚Äúbetter yourself,‚Äù which is good, but when it‚Äôs nonstop it just leads to feeling as if you‚Äôre just not enough. To help with this I focus on self love and meditative breathing. It‚Äôs not a cure-all, but allowing the thoughts to come and pass without judgment as well as focusing on the moment helps me be more present. ### I relate to this in two ways. One is I always felt a little off from other people and used to be labeled weird, and got commented on a lot at home from close family which built up this idea that I need to fix my behavior or check it constantly in order to find ‚Äúsocial peace‚Äù, otherwise I felt critically at the mercy of everyone‚Äôs tiniest tolerance. So it has a strong socially insecure component for me. 

At a point a friend picked up on it and told me straight that I don‚Äôt exude inability to accomodate people at all and that I‚Äôm actually very OK to be around and talk to. This was just about a hear ago, and I‚Äôve been slowly learning to not pay my worries ant attention since, also with hjelp of a psychologist who diagnosed me with ocd and taught about MCT. 

I have leaned more and more towards the notion that I might have adhd though, and am trying to be very systematic about it, while not compulsively researching and seeking assurance ### Yep. All of what you described I relate to and I do think it‚Äôs OCD. Which means it is beatable! ### http://www.ocdspecialists.com/stacey-kuhl-wochner-lcsw-on-the-solving-ritual-in-ocd/ 

I've had the same thing ### I can relate to this... after i had somewhat control over my OCD.. i went on to fix each and every little medical issue i had like clearing up several vitamin deficiencies, skin pores, weight management etc. I don't think mine had anything to do with OCD because i decided myself to get my body straight (which i neglected with severe OCD) but i have to say it did feel like OCD made me feel like i was obsessing over my health. 

But when i achieved my target (except weight üò≠) i had 0 problems pulling away from being health conscious. ### Absolutely. It‚Äôs the nature of the beast. You will most likely never find the end all be all cure for OCD. But if you do, let us know hahah ### The only thing you can heal is the way you try to move with ocd's directions. Go and walk in your direction! You are a great, strong person and OCD is there to block your path of your own life. ### I do this too... ### Definitely relate. Grew up in a household full of goals and reward metrics. It has helped me become very successful, but also been a source of anxiety, inability to be content, and constant self-evaluation. I‚Äôve got the best life on the planet on paper‚Ä¶and yet I can‚Äôt enjoy it. Now THATS tragedy. Try to maintain some mindfulness and understand you‚Äôre great just how you are. It‚Äôs your journey. ‚ù§Ô∏èüôè ### Wow. Struggle with this ### It sounds like what you're describing is moral scrupulosity which is a form of OCD. I have it too and this sounds similar to what I got through daily ### Yup. It‚Äôs just another endless ocd cycle unfortunately ### I have the same, I compulsive review my behaviour and feelings all the time to see what's going on symptom wise and research and obsess over it. I also experience a variety of OCD themes, that I cycle through and some that are constant.

To be honest its no surprise that I can't break out of this one cuz I have quite a lot of comorbid disorders and it has been a decades long struggle to find out what was going on after being refused help and told I had nothing wrong with me. Come to find I have autism, adhd, OCD, BPD, CPTSD, and a chronic auto inflammatory condition. 

As well as a psychiatrist confirming that I experience manic episodes but denying that its bipolar, which doesn't make sense to me (I also told doctors for years that I experienced manic episodes and they did not believe me) so a lot of my OCD obsessions/fears were correct. Some of them not though, I thought I might have schizophrenia, endometriosis, diabetes, etc. at different times but I know I don't have those.

I feel like I'm never going to break out of the health anxiety OCD because I don't feel like I can trust medical professionals anymore.

Edit: I forgot to mention that I also take longer to process and struggle to identify emotions as they're happening due to autism so I don't know how to live without reviewing my memory of how I felt/behaved because I'm a puzzle to myself basically. And without reviewing I make lots of mistakes without ""correcting"" them. ### I do this. Was doing it when read this.. I even have days scheduled so that I have time to google and do tests in the internet and analyze everything etc‚Ä¶. ### Yessss, I always feel like there‚Äôs something wrong with me, or my brain. Some mental disorder, brain tumor, early signs of schizophrenia, whatever my brain can throw at me. I‚Äôm always trying to be a better person and I feel like I‚Äôm forcing it sometimes. Like overanalyzing how I should react or what emotions I ‚Äúshould‚Äù have. It brings lots of guilt and shame ### While I would say that the system that you are implying is definitively OCD, you must also comprehend something: self-help is really, really dangerous. It's the poison that makes us think that we're not ""good enough"" or that ""we're messed up mentally"". I'm gonna be honest: all of it is scam. All of these stupid gurus that do random talks only want you to get hooked to these stupid books and videos. The real thing that will change you is ""self acceptance"", not ""finding what you're missing"". It's a really, really dangerous thing that can make you feel as if there's a reward at the end of the tunnel, and that imaginary reward is excellent for the mind to think that rumination is good (when the thing that develops it Pure O or something).

&#x200B;

I don't mean ""self-acceptance"" as the clich√© thing that happens in a lot of media, but just think that you're not doing anything wrong. I'm pretty sure you are already a great person if you worry too much about your own acts, but you need to let that go forever. You don't need to fix yourself, and stop these compulsions. Mostly because you have to enjoy reality or at least being outside of your head. Those actions of fixing mentally can ruin part of your life here in your existance in this fantastic planet, so don't miss it out. 

&#x200B;

If you think there's something wrong, it's better to look outside instead of feeling like you are broken. Perhaps getting to know new people but you don't feel really good with them? There's always new people to meet out there. Are you supposed to take cold showers at 3 AM while lifting 289412 kg of weights while simmultaniously meditating? I don't quite think so. None of that stupid shit is actually good and just makes you miserable. 

&#x200B;

Enjoy yourself and stop ""fixing"" yourself, because there's no need to man. Also, just one last note: if you see that the writers of these books are rich is because they have managed to scam a lot of people not because they got lucky and somehow found themselves full of money. ### I also deal with this, though I've improved a lot I think.  I don't think it's OCD per se. I tend to journal a lot too - like, too much - I sometimes feel like I just have to write it down when I have an inspiration or learn some bit of wisdom from a book, etc.

I think a lot of it comes down to learning self-trust. With the over-documenting, for example, I've learned that it's partly that I don't trust my future self to be wise or smart. (And I also don't always trust my past self, given how much time I can spend berating it for its decisions) But here is the thing: there is only one self, and that self is the Present Self -- and honestly, that self is perfectly capable. Way more than I give her credit for. All the over-reading, gratuitous self-help, second-guessing that self's decisions -- it doesn't really help. That present self doesn't need all that. It's okay. It really is. ### So, ah, how's that working for you? ### I‚Äôm glad you can relate. Do you think it‚Äôs just anxiety related then? ### If you tend to avoid thoughts, this can be a sign of compulsion. You know the ocd circle is intrusive thoughts and compulsions. Just avoiding thoughts is a compulsion. Also telling yourself ""everything is ok"" or ""i am a good person"" is a compulsion ocd leads you to. ### My son is 27 and was also diagnosed with Pandas at 5 years old and has very powerful body tics which are worse when around people.  He also struggles with intrusive thoughts about upsetting people with his tics and offending people with his general persona. ### I can relate. I almost always feel awkward around people, and sometimes people tell me I don't seem that way - which. amazes. me. 

Helps me lately to think about not believing my thoughts just because I think them - for example, the other person doesn't hate me/ think I'm tremendously boring just because of a lull in the conversation. Weird how this most basic lesson, to not believe your thoughts just because you think them, can take so long to really click. ### I don't have anxiety, so in my case, probably not. Imo, OCD over trying to be perfect? Like how we try to make our surroundigs perfect? If it makes sense. ### Yes absolutely! I do this too, it hjelps so much! I had this thought lately that I really need to stop doubting or feeling bad about what I say in conversations. It‚Äôs the oldest lesson there is, like ‚Äúyou are who you say/ believe you are‚Äù and ¬´don‚Äôt care what anybody else thinks‚Äù sort of, but it just clicked in a way it never had before. The ‚Äúlull‚Äù in the conversation is a great way of putting it. And whoever just isn‚Äôt bothered by it walks away unscathed, incredibly enough ### OCD is a type of anxiety disorder. ### The more I learn, lol. I guess I separate OCD anxiety from anxiety caused by other stuff.

Edit : Google says it's not? I'm not sure. I can see it, since compulsions and intrusive thoughts cause anxiety. Anyway, I'm just suspecting OCD and haven't gotten a diagnosis yet, I'm here because my compulsions and intrusive thoughts bother me and I wanna see how much I relate to the ppl on here. ### I think it is/was considered as such because compulsions are meant to lower anxiety levels. I googled it too and it says it is a type of anxiety disorder, but I would love to know if this is truly right.

I've diagnosed with it and am very anxious person too, wondering if I maybe have GAD too. Psych told me at that time it's all anxiety related, but this was 11 years ago.


I'm new here too, and I hope you feel welcome here! ### OCD used to be considered an anxiety disorder, but I think now is considered a compulsive spectrum disorder. I still consider it an anxiety disorder, because people seem to relate to that better. ### Thanks for welcoming me! ### I read the latest dsm reclassified ocd. It was just something I saw on this sub. 

Imo it will always be an anxiety disorder. Otherwise why do compulsions? Maybe the dsm writers thought ocd related more to wherever they put it, but maybe that doesn‚Äôt take away from it being a disorder primarily fueled by anxiety. 

There‚Äôs also an obsessive compulsive **personality** disorder. Iirc, the difference is that the person with a personality disorder sees their obsessive-compulsiveness as reasonable and nothing that needs to be changed regardless of how it effects them and the people around them. To me, that seems like there‚Äôs no anxiety involved. ### I'm definitely sure this is an anxiety disorder, otherwise we wouldn't try to correct things. Not everyone notices this but what i learned from myself is, there are 2 types of anxiety most of the time; Loud and Quiet. I call the quiet one as the one is so hard to see, realise. People with this don't feel it much but still gets affected, confused by it. In this situation they mostly don't think they have OCD (or can't be sure) and try to figure out if they have it or not. They probably won't think it is this disorder but in fact it is. I started with silent one and it became louder with time. I can understand both and experienced them from time to time; either alone or together they were seperate but strong with different symptoms (effects that are both physical and mental).  

Of course i'm not a professional and this doesn't reflect the truth as it is, these are my observations and experiences from my life. But i'm sure they have a lot to be agreed upon and can be considered (or is) valid. This is just the way i describe them in my words.   


I also want to add that, i looked up for obsessive compulsive spectrum disorder (because i don't know much about it) and it looks very similar to OCD but they are CERTAINLY different things from each other. It's hard for me to describe but they only share similar events in different place (this is the hardest one for me to describe...) with obsessions and compulsions as a common thing in both disorders. I hope it's visible a bit, that they are different from each other. ### ",122,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tirp5q/ocd_urge_to_figure_out_whats_wrong_wme_and_heal/

If you can quit vaping without smoking cigarettes, that would certainly be a good thing. ### ",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tjcps5/will_quitting_vaping_increase_ocd/
tj5fd9,"My rituals are taking less time and I feel very good!!! My mom came to visit me because I'm having a very bad time w my OCD symptoms and they just started taking over my life and affecting my day to day in a way that it gets me down and makes me not want to do things (Contamination OCD), so I really needed support. Even tho I wanted her to come, I was also afraid because she would probably not allow me to complete my rituals (hand washing, long showers), and even tho that's exactly what happened, the constant exposure to situations that might trigger my intrusive thoughts is kind of helping me, like not taking a long shower after going out, going to bed feeling ""dirty"", going out multiple times a day or washing my hands only for 20 seconds (THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE).

I don't know if it's right or wrong that my mom constantly reminds me to stop doing my rituals like ""You're taking too long washing your hands"" or ""Hey it's time to get out of the shower"", but it's helping me in a way. Sure I still try to complete said rituals in one way or another and I don't sleep in my room so I don't ""contaminate"" it, but my thoughts don't take over my day and they get away quicker than usual, so that makes me very happy and the fact that I'm currently going to therapy to see how to truly cope w my intrusive thoughts gives me a lot of hope.

Initially I brushed it off as it being just vaginal discharge but then I started panicking and obsessing over it, thinking that maybe the condom broke or some semen leaked out of it (sideways). I was up all night crying and obsessing, my whole body is hurting from the physical anxiety that I've felt in the last 24 hours. I took the condom out of the garbage 2 times, and I checked and it wasn't broken, nor did I notice any liquid coming out of it. I know it's most probably vaginal discharge (possibly even an infection, because it was pretty thick) yet I cannot stop ruminating. Please help.

See sometimes, we get the thought, and it hits us hard.

But this feeling is going to go away because i truly know that you have nothing to worry about. The condom wasn‚Äôt broken and the leak was 99% chance its vaginal discharge. Remember how unlikely it is that you could get pregnant with the safe steps you took. And people with our condition at the moment can‚Äôt feel anything but the obsessions and we can‚Äôt realize that its in our head. But hey thats ok because its just in our head, take some time to relax, destress, and try ur best to distract yourself atm and keep reminding yourself that theres a high chance you it didn‚Äôt happen because I truly believe you have nothing to worry about. Over time, therapists recommend just letting the thought sit there and slowly adjust to realizing its just a thought, nothing else. In the meantime slowly remind yourself how unlikely it is, and with each passing obsession and getting over it which you will do because your stronger thank you think and your brain will automatically start to realize how misinforming these thoughts are and how unlikely and misleading it was in the first place. It literally took me an hour to write this because of my OCD but we gotta look out for each other and help each other realize we are stronger than our thoughts ### It‚Äôs most likely just your own cum, if the condom was fine, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs just your own discharge.

I have been struggling with health anxiety for a really long time. This is something that I have been working through with therapy and I will of course talk to my therapist about this new bread of OCD soon.

I would like to be absolutely clear. I am not suicidal in anyway shape or form. I just entered a career I love and got engaged and happily enjoying my life. 

I am actually just terrified that these thoughts have came into my head because my brain is picking it apart like it does with health.

time when i called my dad while he was in the office, even his friend asked if i was calling and that was when i realized how much of a nuisance i was being. so i came up with a chant of sorts to calm me down. i told myself i would call them only once every 2 hours instead of every half an hour or every hour. i had to say this chant 50 times a day, minimum or even a hundred, and i would always say on the way to school.it went something like 'please let my family members live until they're 90/100. please let them be safe, happy and alive.' i added that last part because i thought god would only listen to me if i was very specific about my requirements during the chant. i would include my cats on days when i thought my cats were in danger. this lasted for a period of about 2 years, from when i was 10 to when i was 12, and it started after my grandmother died, and my cat died. i remember having these little patterns or having to do things in a specific order or i would get really upset when i was younger, but i knew that was considered weird so i did a good job of hiding it, but after my grandmother's death and seeing my cat's dead body on a street, i got so worried my family would die. i did not want to include my uncle in the chant originally because he was an alcoholic and i was very angry at him for it, but he made me aunt happy so i included him. when i said let them be happy, it included making sure my mother and father and aunt and uncle stayed together and my uncle getting better. 

so after this chant, i believed that anytime i really wanted something, like to do well on a test or want someone to be nice to me, i could ask god nicely about 20 times or 50 times a day till the event happened and he would listen to me. over the pandemic, i was stuck at home with my parents and they treated me like shit and my uncle ended up dying anyway so i decided the chant didn't work and didn't do it anymore. i would still do random obsessions, but after i tried to kill myself i didn't care about anything anymore and i was and still am so detached emotionally from myself and people around me that i have stopped the chants altogether, but i still get really angry and have awful thoughts of hurting my parents sometimes. i know this is called a compulsion and it's related to ocd, but i have been wondering why i suddenly stopped with the compulsions. it is not something that randomly stops whenever you'd like it to, so is it just that i am too depressed to do that anymore? 

anyway, i'm sorry for the long read, thank you to anyone who has read this far and to anyone who might comment on this post.

tldr : i used to do compulsions when i was younger, and i stopped doing this eventually after my 2nd or third suicide attempt, i eventually stopped doing them and i was wondering if i actually have ocd and i am too depressed to continue the compulsions or if this was a symptom of something else entirely.",4,2022-03-21 06:34:20-04:00,"Hi, I‚Äôm so sorry about what you have gone through. Certain aspects of what you describe I can really relate. In fact, my earliest memories on hindsight about how my OCD began were when I first became convinced God could hear what I said if I spoke directly to God. I also went through a phase where I would engage in rituals to try and ensure my parents lived a long healthy life.

Fast forward to present, I am very much affected by scrupulosity and I have been clinically diagnosed with OCD. A few things I learnt about OCD and hopefully for you to ponder:

1. OCD comes and goes over the years.
2. When OCD peaks, it can get very overwhelming and exhausting, which gets me in a very dark place, so I do believe OCD can get you feeling depressed. Over the years, I sometimes get so frustrated that I stop my compulsions entirely out of pure anger and hopelessness, although they do come back eventually, after OCD morphs into something more insidious and terrifying‚Ä¶

My doc recently diagnosed me with atypical depression, because I thought for the longest time that I had BPD because my mood swings are so bad. Then he was like, do you fear abandonment? and I'm like I mean no not really? Of course I'd try to avoid it but it's not like I'm going crazy or anything to avoid it.

And then we looked at more symptoms of BPD and he was like yeah I don't think you have that. Have you heard of Atypical Depression? and I'm like bruh WHAT where has this diagnosis been all my life.

If you haven't heard of it: it includes overeating, oversleeping, a heavy feeling in the limbs when depressed, and the two most important symptoms for me, *depression that temporarily lifts when something positive happens,* and *interpersonal rejection sensitivity*. I often get hostile when offended. Not straight up rage, nor screaming and crying like BPD (or even quiet bpd where people suffer internally, I don't do that either). But I give people MAJOR cold shoulders. Like imagine a bitchy high school teenager after someone calls their shoes ugly or something. But then I get over it, and I don't call people names or anything.

tj3yvc,"My compulsion makes me feel isolated I have had (diagnosed) OCD for about two and a half years now. Since July 2021, I've developed a compulsion where I have to listen to podcasts at all times (except for when actively engaging in conversation or intellectually stimulating activities) including when I'm showering, walking to my kitchen to get a snack, and even sleeping. 

I didn't realize how bad my compulsion really was until I went to intensive outpatient therapy and did meditation at the end of my first week. I ended up having a huge panic attack because I couldn't stand the silence. That was when I realized that I hadn't been in the quiet or sat with my own thoughts for a very long time, because whenever I would have an intrusive thought, I would just block it out with podcasts. 

Since my compulsion worsened over the past summer, I have listened to hundreds of hours at podcasts. This has led to me to getting weeks or even months behind on school work and not engaging with my peers at school. I also almost never listen to music anymore which is devastating because I love music. 

In exposure therapy, I'm now working on getting comfortable in silence but it's really hard. All the therapists at my IOP say that this is a normal compulsion that ""makes sense"", but I've never met anyone with this type of compulsion, and it's pretty isolating. **Was wondering if anyone has a similar stimulation compulsion (listening to music or audiobooks, watching TV, constantly reading, etc.**).",1,2022-03-21 01:00:23-04:00,"I'm constantly listening to music or other things because I can't stand silence.

tisebm,"Exposure therapy question & hand washing question. Help me learn what is normal‚Ä¶ So I‚Äôve read to wipe the inside of a trash can with a towel and then use that towel to dry off after a shower. Is there a genuine risk of getting food poisoning from this based on what was in the trash? Or is the risk so low that it won‚Äôt hurt me? Is this a real exposure therapy tool to overcome contamination ocd? It feels risky but I can‚Äôt tell if this is just my ocd telling me this. 

Second question‚Ä¶when you make yourself a sandwich how many times do you wash your hands (people that don‚Äôt have contamination ocd please‚Ä¶I need to know what is normal and acceptable not what is a compulsion. I‚Äôm trying to break my compulsions and learn what is normal hygiene versus ocd)? So do you wash your hands after touching the lunch meat before you put the lunch meat away? Or do you use your lunch meat contaminated hands to close the container and open the fridge and get out the cheese etc and put it all away then eat your sandwich then wash your hands when you are all done? Will the germs from the lunch meat be spoiled tomorrow when you go to touch the handles of the fridge and make yourself another sandwich? I‚Äôm seriously needing to know what is ocd driven versus what the rest of the world does. 

I know this sounds like a silly question. Please help me learn what‚Äôs normal. Thank you for reading this.",44,2022-03-20 15:12:03-04:00,"I have contamination OCD and have to say my immediate response to the scenario of wiping the trash can with a towel you are using to dry off after a shower spiked my anxiety and immediately I said to myself... no way in hell!  But again I share the same ocd subtype as you so maybe this would be a good exercise.  My issue however is I am afraid of spreading germs to others so it makes it even more difficult I think.  I wouldn't be so concerned with myself but I would be concerned that maybe it would make someone else sick and that would be my fault.  I am way more fearful of making someone else sick than I am with myself.  I just don't know how that can be treated.  I just had my first therapy session last week so hopefully my therapist will be able to help. ### As promised here is my reply. I do not have contamination ocd and have never suffered from it. If your therapist has told you about the towel idea, then do it. With ocd, because our thought process is so extreme, we need to do extreme challenges to tackle it. No one is going to deliberately smear germs all over their face when they don't have ocd, but with contamination ocd that might be a typical form of erp. We need to do extreme stuff to tackle the extreme anxiety and other emotions we feel.

As for washing hands, i sometimes do, sometimes don't. I only ever always wash my hands if I touch raw meat, but that's about it. Talk to your therapist, but I'd say until then to just wash your hands for only raw meat, and then listen to your ocd for the rest. If your ocd says to wash your hands when you touch bread, don't wash them. Do the opposite of what your ocd tells you to do. ### To the 2nd question: I only wash my hands before and sometimes after making the sandwich. The germs from the lunch meat on the handle will be spoiled by the next time you touch it. Nobody I know has ever gotten sick from making a sandwich like this. Goodluck on getting over this :) ### I use a napkin while making a sandwich, it‚Äôs a compromise. So after putting each item on the sandwich I wipe my hands on the napkin. I wash my hands after all is done before I sit down. For perspective my father has made himself(and others) a sandwich nearly everyday for many decades, not a diverse diet, and he doesn‚Äôt wash his hands at all or use a napkin. He has not gotten food poisoning that I‚Äôve been aware of nor anyone else.

Wiping the inside of a trashcan and transferring that to the shower is a bit much. Idgaf if it helps with my ocd it ain‚Äôt happening. I don‚Äôt believe anything would happen if I did, but no. For me personally I would have to start smaller, like cleaning the trashcan without bleach! I do see the logic in it though‚Ä¶

I will say that in the past I have adopted a f**k it mindset where I force myself to say that and let it go whatever it is. The more I did that the more it helped. Too bad isolation makes the worst of the OCD come back, like a beast. ### I hate washing my hands several times. Day. But my parents recently put antibacterial hand wipes in the bathroom so... ### It is ok to ask what ‚Äúnormal‚Äù (I hate that word but you know what I mean) behavior is.

No I would not wipe my towel on a trash bin and then dry off from a shower. ERPs are supposed to help us do daily activities and you would never do that. I use my bath towels 2-3 times before washing.

For the sandwich. I would wash my hands once before I start making it. Sometimes I do this before I grab my plate and other times I forget and do it after I‚Äôve touched some things. I have never gotten sick. I only wash my hands during cooking when touching raw meat or doing something messy like kneading dough. You do not need to wash after touching lunch meat, you will not get food poisoning.

I use NOCD for my ERP therapy. It is very difficult to do without a therapist guiding you. You‚Äôll just set yourself up for failure. ### In regards to the towel in trash can and drying yourself that would give me severe anxiety but even pre OCD I would have thought it was gross but my psychologist explained the other day that as we are definitely going to have a little blip at some point then we need to go beyond what normal people would do so our blip takes us to normal and not past it. Does that make sense? My psychologist suggested touching the toilet seat before eating or touching the bottom of your shoes, which instantly grossed me out. She did say that she would never ask me to so something that she wouldn't so herself. 

Handwashing I can't help sorry but am also interested in responses. ### Hello there! I can't give you a neutral opinion because I am also struggling with contamination OCD, but I hope that I can help you a little bit anyway.

I'll be honest, the towel in the trash can thing feels completely weird to me, and really gross. Imo, I don't think that a sane person would do that anyways, so I wouldn't do it to get out of OCD. To me, exposure therapy is about getting back to normal by not reacting with compulsion to an everyday situation (e. g do not wash hands after picking up and object that accidentally fell on the floor, but do not throw the object voluntarily on the floor), not do extreme things to trigger the maximum level of anxiety. I don't know for others, but doing extreme things voluntarily wouldn't work for me, I think it would be counter-productive. Instead, I try to ask myself ""what would former me (me without OCD) would do in this situation? Would former me even notice or worry? What other people would do? What is the actual and reasonable risk?""

For the sandwich question, I feel you. Cooking has become a bit difficult for me due to the constant wondering if I should wash my hands after touching smth. A few months ago, I would have washed my hands at every step and probably would have ended up bursting in anger towards myself. Now that my anxiety level has dropped, I hope that I can help you a little. I would wash my hands before making the sandwich, and if in the process I touch meat, I would only rince them and dry them up with a kitchen cloth. I would only wash them if I touch raw meat or an ""unfit for cooking cleanliness"" surface such as the trash can or the floor. Normally, your kitchen is clean, the dishes and the utensils are clean, so don't worry. You cannot get sick nor cannot make someone get sick by using your kitchen and touching only cooked meat with your bare hands.

Hang in there, you can get out of this, it takes time, and it's okay if you hit a few bumps down the road.

Cheers! ### You're the first person I've seen who is more worried about making other people sick than I am myself.  I am terrified of giving someone food poisoning and I'm the most anal person I know about food safety.  However, I would never in a million years use a towel that touched the trashcan.  The thought makes my skin crawl and I want to puke lol.
I have some weird new contamination compulsions that I didn't have pre-covid though that aren't really directed at others.  Anything that has not been wiped with a disinfecting wipe that I have gotten from the store, I now have to wash my hands after I have touched it.  In the sandwich making scenario, say I forgot to put mustard on.  If I had to touch the bottle to put some on, I'd have to wash my hands again before eating.  This has made cooking a much more laborious task than it was previously.  It is also so frustrating because I *know* that there is almost no chance of surface transmission for covid but I can't stop doing it! ### Oh trust me I said hell no to the trash can thing. I am either not there yet or may never be. It is beyond my grasp right now. I have no intention of doing that either. But I did the spatula thing. Feel a little ill right now. Hoping it just anxiety. I worry about both me and others. So I get it. It‚Äôs truly hard. I wish you the best on your journey. Fight my friend. Win. You can do it! ### Thank you so much! This is helpful! ### Thank you for answering! I really appreciate this! So to clarify you said the germs on the handle from the lunch meat will be spoiled by next time you touch it. Could you explain what you mean by that?

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/OCD) if you have any questions or concerns.* ### Thank you so much for your response. That helps me keep things in perspective. It really helps to hear these stories. 

I agree about the trash can and towel thing. There‚Äôs no way I could do that. I couldn‚Äôt believe that would even be ok. So I need another way to overcome this since that isn‚Äôt happening lol. 

Yes covid fears and isolation has fed the ocd monster for sure. Need to find a way to slay that beast lol. ### What is nocd? 

This makes total sense as to why the towel trash can doesn‚Äôt help and feels so off to me. I have no plans of doing that. The lunch meat is something I will be working on. I think I‚Äôve heard enough people that say I won‚Äôt get sick that I think it‚Äôs a normal practice. And yea I hate that word too. It makes me feel less than normal and I should respect myself more than that. Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts. ### Thank you for this. I agree. We have to do some stupid things to tell our brain to shut up lol. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è ### General Kenobi ### Thank you! Glad you are doing so well! ### Sorry, I think I didnt word it right lol

I mean that the germs will be dead (not sure if thats the right word to use) to the point that they can‚Äôt effect you. 

Also I totally get it! I‚Äôve had things I obsess over like this, and ppl I‚Äôm close to don‚Äôt get it alot of the time. Hope this all helps! ### Bad bot now I‚Äôm gonna ruminate about this ### I get it, my aunt hasn‚Äôt left the house much and nobody has visited her since my uncle, her brother, passed 6 months in to Covid. She apparently keeps everything spotless and wiped down after someone touches it. I was going down that route and then one day said screw it, made myself go to the grocery store at busy time without a mask or hand sanitizer! It was really difficult but I managed to get through it and was much easier going afterwards. Before that if someone coughed an aisle over I was leaving. ### Something that has really helped me over the years is learning to laugh at myself. It may not be for everyone, but I‚Äôve tried to find the humor in what I think and what I do, because frankly a lot of it for me is ridiculously funny once I get past the this is ruining my life part. I have a peculiar relationship with my OCD, I talk to my intrusive thoughts and behaviors telling myself to stop, that‚Äôs ridiculous, you‚Äôre being extra, or whatever and sometimes I talk to myself out loud cause that helps even more. I‚Äôve yelled at myself when I‚Äôm really stuck. Usually though saying something to myself and then realizing how silly I am being and having a good laugh at my OCD‚Äôs expense is enough to intervene. ### Just an FYI you‚Äôre seeking reassurance which is really detrimental. By saying you feel good to do it now that enough people have told you that you won‚Äôt get sick is NOT good. You are not accepting the uncertainty that you might get sick. That is a possibility but it‚Äôs a possibility that you can handle. You can handle being sick! It happens, we all get sick.

ERP therapy forces you to accept the fear and uncertainty and that gives you the strength to not do your compulsions. Even though wiping your towel on the bin is impractical, that might be something your therapist asks you to do. Because honestly, you wouldn‚Äôt get sick from it haha.

NOCD is an online therapy provider that specializes in ERP therapy. Everything is virtual and I love it. You match with a therapist in your state (US only) who takes your insurance. Then you have about six 1 hr sessions where you learn about ERP therapy and how OCD works. Then you just have 20 min sessions where you do exposures with your therapist so they can guide you. Then you do exposures on your own in between sessions. You can message your therapist through the app and ask any question! There‚Äôs also a message board and someone you can call if you have a crisis. ### Ah ok. That‚Äôs makes sense! Thank you! This helps a lot! ### Ok so please don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm nuts, but to prove to myself I won‚Äôt get sick and die is it comparable to touch my tongue to the end of a dirty spatula I used 24hours ago? I feel like I have to prove to my brain I‚Äôm overreacting and I won‚Äôt get sick so I can accept it and not worry about it anymore. I feel this could be a comparable way to do that or am I setting myself up to die lol? I know it‚Äôs gross but surely if the meat on the fridge handle is ok the 24 hour egg spatula should be? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Don‚Äôt worry I won‚Äôt hold you liable lol ü§£‚Ä¶just looking for an honest opinion from someone who gets this stupid disease. ### ü§£ bad bot. This made me laugh. ### I feel this hard. My brother died last year and set me in motion and yep if someone coughs an isle over I have no need for anything in that isle this week. Can‚Äôt give up the mask or hand sanitizer but I don‚Äôt wipe things down and I do go out to the stores weekly and sometimes more. I have three sales to hit this week lol. Yes it‚Äôs true the more you do the easier it gets. It‚Äôs just a slow process. Baby steps if my style. Working through my hierarchy easy to hard. Maybe someday I‚Äôll give up the mask. Just not today. ### Good for you for doing the hard work! That‚Äôs great and inspiring! ### Yes I do this too! Sometimes I have to laugh so I don‚Äôt cry and other times I‚Äôm so furious I yell at this monster that lives in my head. It really does help. ### Ok thank you. My therapist didn‚Äôt ask me to do either of these things. I read the towel thing in a book and the touching my tongue to the end of a dirty spatula I used to cook eggs the day before was my choice because I was tired of being afraid of lunch meat & thought it would be a similar exposure. I had already done it before that post. So yes I guess I was seeking reassurance because my husband was really mad at me for doing it and made me think I was going to die & he thought that I was committing su1cide by purposely ingesting rotten food. It was a big fight which I thought I was doing something good and he thought I was going to d1e. He doesn‚Äôt understand that I have to do these crazy things. He doesn‚Äôt get this disease. He deals with it and has for a long time but not to this extreme. So yes I guess I was asking for reassurance that he was wrong and I wasn‚Äôt going to die like he suggested I would. I probably shouldn‚Äôt have done the exposure before talking to my therapist but I was so angry at the time & it‚Äôs the easiest time for me to do exposures on my own. I think I shouldn‚Äôt maybe do exposures on my own in the future. But my therapist will answer my questions like these so I didn‚Äôt think it was a big deal. But they also encourage me to do exposures on my own if I want to so I did. I just thought I‚Äôd ask a question here from others that get it since it was the weekend I didn‚Äôt want to bother her. I really didn‚Äôt think it was seeking reassurance but I guess it was. I‚Äôll rethink asking questions in the future. Just so you know, my ocd is also driven by facts. I am able to use facts to overcome my fears without doing an exposure. If I can gather enough information to use as ‚Äúammunition‚Äù for my brain I can shut it off. So this is also how I deal with my ocd sometimes for the more mild scenarios. The bigger things take exposures. But the small things I can talk myself into submission. I know not everyone is like that and will never believe statistics unless they do it themselves so we all are a bit different in how we handle our ocd. But you are right reassurance in general is frowned upon so thank you for pointing that out. I‚Äôll look into that app it sounds interesting. Thank you for all your opinions. I appreciate them & will take them to heart. ### Honestly I‚Äôm not sure üò≠ if the spatula touched raw egg I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it, but the lunch meat thing could be compared to touching your tongue to a spatula that only touched cooked egg or spaghetti sauce ### Hey. I have contamination OCD, to be clear. But ERP-wise, yes, this would be a great task to try. 

As for the bin task, are you doing ERP alongside a therapist? I‚Äôve not heard of anyone trying that sort of thing alone and personally I‚Äôm not sure I would manage it without support, but if you think you could then that‚Äôs fantastic. ### My psychologist has suggested that I touch a door handle quite thoroughly then using those hands rub a biscuit/cookie whatever they're call where you are then once it's truely covered in the door handle germs then eat it and sit with the anxiety, don't so anything to distract yourself from what you did. ### If you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please do not hesitate to talk to someone.

tj38q9,"your recovery I'm curious to hear about how people experience their recovery, how it felt. I'm unfortunately not able to get into therapy at the moment, so my dealing with my OCD has been me just wrestling it into submission. I have no idea what this form of recovery should feel like. I've been researching it myself while waiting for a call back to get in and see a specialist. 

I've noticed that my intrusive thoughts have started fading but the anxiety kind of remains. But I've also noticed that now instead of intrusive thoughts my brain has started trying to tell me that I am the person behind the intrusive thoughts. 

I know it's getting better. I've done this before. I've just never done ERP, so this is new to me.

I would love to see the positive experiences and how you've worked to get better. When you have OCD, I think it's important to have hope.

So what do your recovery experiences look like?


*Note: I understand this likely looks like reassurance, and maybe it is. But I also believe this could also be helpful to the community itself.",1,2022-03-21 00:15:13-04:00,"Having OCD was like being trapped inside a prison cell. But none of my family or friends could see the bars I was 'doing time' behind.

Then one day as I was checking the stove I finally realized that the real problem was that I couldn't remember if what I had checked had been checked properly.

As I was looking at the real stove I could clearly see it was off...but as soon as I turned my back on it the words ""What if?"" would haunt me.

""What if I haven't checked properly?"" ""What if the stove catches fire and the house burns down?""

Since I was a boy I have been interested in the human potential movement. I've always been interested in what is 'humanly possible.' 

Thus this led me to memory enhancement techniques. These techniques help me to **remember** that everything I check is safely off, locked, and closed.

I'm still in prison. 

But my cell door is locked by a combination lock. And I know how to pick it each and every time I check. 

So I still have Safety OCD Checking but literally the things I check take less than a couple of seconds. 

I can check faster than you can tap your PIN number into your phone. 

I only know the PIN number to the safety OCD checking prison cell. Not any other type of OCD.

tj1b5w,"Zoloft+ERP worked for me. Hi everyone!

I was diagnosed with OCD about 4 years ago. I struggled with many different themes to my OCD. From harm, to health, to sensuality. It was all over the place and I was barely functioning because of it. I sought out a therapist with experience in treating OCD. (Still took me 3 therapists to find one I really liked). Over the course of a year we did Exposure therapy for my OCD. I had to write down scripts about my biggest fears coming true. I had to record myself saying them out loud and then listen to them as well. This worked REALLY well! But I still felt like something was missing. I put off taking medication for about a year and a half because I was so terrified of side effects. I finally caved because I was so tired of the ups and downs of my emotions. 

I saw a psychiatrist who specialized in treating OCD. She was so reassuring and amazing. She prescribed me 100mg of Zoloft to take once daily. I started at 25mg and went up 25mg every week until I was at 100mg. The side effects didn't suck as bad as I though, although I know everyone is different. I just had a really hard time falling asleep at night. I took melatonin to counter that. After about a month or so on Zoloft, I wad able to see a huge difference in my anxiety and my reactions to my intrusive thoughts. My brain wouldn't spiral anymore and attach to each and every thought I had. It was easier and easier to dismiss my OCD and anxiety and I finally felt normal again. 

I've now been on Zoloft for about 7 months and it's been working out great. When I do have OCD thoughts my heart doesn't race anymore, I don't start sweating or panicking either. Instead, I just think to myself ""heh that's just OCD"" and go on with my day and my god that is such a good fefeeling. Just wanted to share my experience! I'm open to answering any questions too!",5,2022-03-20 22:27:11-04:00,"I have many questions üò≠ This sounds awesome. I‚Äôve been putting off medicine for a long time. My ERP therapist said she thinks it will really get me some relief. 

I‚Äôve gotten meds prescribed for PMDD- Celexa. I‚Äôve never touched them because I am terrified of side effects and turning into a different person. Or things getting worse. I‚Äôve tried getting other meds though, because I hear alot about Zoloft and Lexapro. I‚Äôve tried my general doctor and this other psychiatrist and they both kinda just suggest the celexa. I feel worse taking it because it‚Äôs not a mainstream one and what if Zoloft is what I need? Or Lexapro? They kept saying they don‚Äôt know if the pills work or not since I haven‚Äôt taken it, but idk im kinda frustrated. Or is this my OCD fixating on the perfect pill and I‚Äôm avoiding? Idk. I just wish an OCD psychiatrist would see me. ### Great to hear this.  I just started therapy last week and also started the process of tapering off paroxetine (paxil) and will be starting Zoloft this week at a 12.5mg starting dose.  I've taken paroxetine for almost 20 years and have almost zero side effects that I can tell but my doctor feels like it just may not be working like it used to.  Your story has given me hope that I may be able to see the same success.  I feel like the sweating/panicking/heart racing just overwhelms logical thinking making it hard to pause long enough to try and resist compulsions when you're having a bad episode.  I've been given clonazepam .5mg for when I get really anxious/panicky and my ability to resist doing compulsions is so much greater when I take it.  It actually makes me feel normal - not drugged, sedated or euphoric.  The thoughts are still there but I don't give into every compulsion my ocd tells me to do.  I am hoping that this is what Zoloft does once its produced its full effect.  But who knows, I may or may not do well on it.  Just have to try it and see. ### I‚Äôve been taking Zoloft (we just call it Sertraline here) for a few years and to be honest i think maybe my dose is too low. Like you I found I had problems sleeping but nothing that didn‚Äôt sort itself out (it was weird, it kind of felt like falling asleep was a trick that I‚Äôd forgotten, i just couldn‚Äôt work out how to do it). 

I do find it helps with the OCD especially with sort of shortening the ‚Äúworry length‚Äù after a trigger but I was hoping for more of a result like being able to correctly label a worry as OCD as you describe. I take 50mg and im a reasonably big guy so maybe I should be on 100mg.

Obviously this is just my experience as a sufferer, only a doctor can advise about medication properly. ### It's your OCD fixating. As shitty as it is, you won't know until you try. I put off medication for so long because my OCD kept telling me it was going to change me. ### I totally get it with the sleep thing! It's like my body forgot how to do it! My psychiatrist is an OCD specialist (if you're in or near Michigan I can give you the rec) and she told me that 100mg is usually the starting dose she prescribes for OCD (obviously starting at 25 and working up to 100 over the course of a few weeks to minimize side effects). I'm definitely a bigger girl (200+), so it may be worth revisiting with you doc! ### ",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tj1b5w/zolofterp_worked_for_me/

tiwk1z,"Bisexual with OCD? Hello

I've recently started to realize that I may be Bisexual, with OCD.

I've known that I've most likely had OCD for quite some time, but only just realized it may be Sexual Orientation OCD

My intrusive thoughts about my sexuality mainly lie in the idea that I'm faking it, or forcing attractions to the same gender. My OCD is constantly trying to disprove any idea that I'm Bisexual, and uses any feelings it can to prove it. In response, I perform compulsions in order to prove it wrong and to prove I really could be Bi. Of course, due to the nature of OCD, this isn't productive.

The reason I don't think it's Homosexual OCD is because I don't have any fear at all regarding the idea of being Bi or attracted to the same gender. There are some instances where it feels like I \*should\* be attracted to the same gender, and that it'd be right. Of course, OCD also tries to use that as proof that I'm really just straight and faking. I've also noticed my OCD targets me by making me doubt my attraction to the same gender, not making me doubt being straight by saying I am attracted to the same gender.

Is anybody else here Bi with OCD? Does this make sense? And what are some exposures and treatment I can do?",15,2022-03-20 18:24:19-04:00,"This could also be sexual orientation OCD.  Essentially ocd is the doubt disease.  You are doubting your orientation and having compulsions to make yourself feel certain about it. ### Do you feel distressed somehow when you come across a person from the same gender? And are you checking body parts? This can really answer your questions. I  suffered from sexual orientation ocd in puberty and it was such a bad experience mainly because of doubting. ### So Sexual orientation OCD can work in any way possible, you can be straight and fear you are gay or bi, you can be gay and fear you are straight or bi, or you can be bi and fear your not attracted to one of the genders, whether it be the same or opposite gender. It‚Äôs all the same, just from different angles.

So yes you can be bi and have sexual orientation OCD, and yes it can be about obsessively worrying that you are not attracted to the same gender and that you are faking it. ### Well that's what I meant, Sexual Orientation OCD ### >Do you feel distressed somehow when you come across a person from the same gender?

A little bit, but not because I'm scared of being attracted to them. Really it comes from either being attracted to them and my brain questioning if it's real or not, or not finding them attractive and doubting I'm even Bi to begin with

>And are you checking body parts?

Mine? If so, yes, but usually stuff like groinal responses to men (I'm a cisgender male btw) provides me with relief or satisfaction, and none gives me anxiety.

I didn't really deal with much of this during puberty since I grew up in a Conservative home and never even entertained the idea of supporting gay people, let along being attracted to a man. Hell, the idea of having sex with women wasn't one I actively entertained, even though I knew I liked them.  I only recently started questioning in 2020 once I had long grown away from those beliefs but I don't think OCD was there at that time. ### >So yes you can be bi and have sexual orientation OCD, and yes it can be about obsessively worrying that you are not attracted to the same gender and that you are faking it.

This is really what it feels like to me. Like at first there was some anxiety to potentially being Bi, but it felt more like internalized homophobia. Now 95% of my thoughts are about trying to verify if I'm actually attracted to men or if I'm trying to force/fake it ### I want/need to be absolutely sure about my sexual orientation.  In order to do this I do checks.  When I get anxiety about my SO I need to accept the feelings and not give into the compulsions to check my SO. .first find what your compulsions are so you can refrain.  Refraining I'd the response prevention part of it. ### If you are bi you'll get physically aroused by people of the same gender. As you describe it looks for me like ocd ### Well if you experience attractions to men and women in real life, wish to have romantic relations with both genders, and both sides doesn‚Äôt cause you distress, then it‚Äôs safe to say your bisexual, not trying to reassure you just making it known. 

If you are addicted to porn, then I would recommend going pornfree, it‚Äôs very common that a lot of people who are addicted to porn escalate into genres that are not things they are actually interested, for example, a straight guy could get into bi or gay porn and a gay guy can get into straight or lesbian porn. Once you lay off the porn tho, your dopamine receptors will return to normal and your true sexuality will show.

If you aren‚Äôt addicted to porn, start working on educating yourself on Self ERP therapy, seek medical professional if you are able too, and start implementing recovery strategies for your OCD! Best of luck friend ### I do get physically aroused to the same gender sometimes, and like I said, when it happens, I get happy, not scared/anxious like someone with HOCD ### Well I do look at porn quite often. I don't know if I have an addiction, but maybe I should stop looking for a week. I don't know if it's had an affect on my sexuality (I'll probably get intrusive thoughts about this now) because I still think I get attractions outside of it, but still ### I should also mention I'm on anti-depressants which might have an affect on stuff ### Well from my experience i have suffered every type of pure ocd (harm ocd which is the worst thing ever, sexual orientation, relationship, decision, etc). And this sexual orientation ocd stuff last only a small period of time. But i  don't understand the source of you distression ### The distression comes from the idea that I'm trying to force myself to be Bi, or that I'm faking it and don't really experience attraction to the same gender 

Whereas a straight person's compulsions would be geared towards making sure they're not attracted to the same gender, mine are usually geared towards making sure I am ### Yup i understand now. It's the same thing. You fear of not being bi, so that makes sense. It's the first time encountering a person with the reverse thing. I'll give you an advice as I'm in therapy for ocd 10 months in. Realize what's the intrusive thought is and sit with the anxiety for 10 mins. In your case the intrusive thought is ""Am I bi or not?"". Sit with this thought for 10 mins(or a bit more ) until anxiety falls and cut the compulsion stuff like ""this isn't true"" or trying to avoid the intrusive thought. Do this every day.

I've been making a lot of progress in ERP, and a week ago I had an epiphany that essentially confirmed a lot of my biggest theme (it's very complicated to explain lol). It felt much different than my regular OCD intrusive thoughts, and while it was painful to acknowledge, I knew I needed to in order to truly be at peace with myself. It was tough at first, but thanks to the progress I've been making, I've been able to handle it instead of turning to my usual compulsions. Just taking it day by day right now and slowly accepting the many grey areas I'm running into. The OCD is still there, and I still have some painful moments, but I'm feeling much better.

Even though I always saw this outcome as the ""worst case scenario,"" ERP and therapy have shown me that I'm far from hopeless. The world hasn't ended. I have so many resources and tools at my disposal, the most powerful one being my newly found faith in myself. I'm strong. I can get through this. And if I can somehow get to where I am right now, anyone can. ERP sucks, but I promise it's worth it.

(Please no ""how did you know"" questions! That's just reassurance seeking, and I don't want to encourage that. Also, this post isn't a ""sign"" or anything! This is just specific to my own personal OCD journey. Everyone is different!)",10,2022-03-20 12:50:27-04:00,"Really great your ERP has been going well! It really does suck but I‚Äôm so glad it‚Äôs helping you. ### Often times it's not the thought's subjects themselves being true or not that's the source of the fear but the severity or how much it will effect your quality of life, which is exaggerated. 

But most of the time the thoughts aren't even true and ignoring the statistical unlikeliness of each one will still be a problem. ### I had a couple times where I thought my biggest OCD fear was true (not obsessive thinking; a real possibility that was told to me) and while terrifying, it‚Äôs a HUGE boost in treatment. It really helps you understand that your fear about impact is exaggerated. Good luck! ### So alot of people with ocd themes eg hocd kind of means alot of there thoughts are true and they are indeed gay? ### Thank you! I honestly don't know what I'd do without it. ### For sure. It's definitely a mix of both in my case, and I can acknowledge that most people's intrusive thoughts turn out not to be true. OCD is a complex, individualistic thing. ### While my personal situation leaves me with quite a large impact, you're definitely right in saying that OCD still manages to exaggerate the potential worst case scenario into an unrealistic doomsday. I think it's less that I'm understanding that my fear was somewhat exaggerated and more that I'm actually capable of handling this worst case scenario. It's been really scary and painful, but it's also shown me that I'm strong enough to make it through that fear and pain, which is oddly empowering. ### thats not what the post is saying at all ### Nope, not at all. In fact, I wrote a disclaimer at the end to make sure this post wouldn't be misconstrued like that. Just because you have an intrusive thought doesn't mean that the intrusive thought is true. Lots of people find that their intrusive thoughts aren't after they've worked on treatment for a while. I was just sharing a personal accomplishment. ### Yes! Sorry, you put it much better than me.

ti94ib,"why the fuck is pocd banned here? **EDIT: Oh look my post got locked by the same moderator that commented: "" Because of Reddit. Why does it bother you? OCD is OCD the little letter in front means nothing.""**

*That little letter in front is an entire other layer of stigma and shame. Each sub type is different, but not all sub types are treated equally by clinicians and therapists. And to alienate one subtype and not the rest?*

*Being inclusive of all themes is incredibly important,* ***especially taboo themes.*** 

It is important to be particularly accepting of taboo themes because of how alienated they are. 

According to a study from: [https://nynjocd.com/pocd/](https://nynjocd.com/pocd/) a study was conducted with POCD patients and general therapists, and **42.9%** were misdiagnosed (1/3 of the patients were misdiagnosed and classified as pedophilia). The lowest rate of misdiagnosis was for contamination obsessions at a **15.8%.** 

It is so obvious that there is such a difference here, ***but the mods don't really care.***

*Told my first therapist about POCD, and she thought I was crazy. Told her about my health ocd as well, and for that she was supportive. People with POCD and Harm OCD are afraid of societal responses.* 

# My original Post:

For those of you who don't know, under rule 12 of this sub, any talk of POCD is prohibited.

""12. We do not allow POCD here.""

The reason is because reddit might take those posts down (reddit may look at it as something related to actual Ps) and cause the subreddit to tank or get banned.

Now if this wasn't bad enough, the mods keep ***taking down posts*** talking about this at all. They took down the original post where they talked about why they banned it.

**Any sort of outrage about disallowing POCD to exist here is met with censorship.**

Also, they took down my old post questioning this rule in the first place which had like 200 upvotes and a fuck ton of agreement.

***Clearly they are trying to silence this part of the community.***

To me and many others, **this is outrageous.**

Now here's my questions and comments to the moderators:

1. Do you care more about your posts and reputation *as a subreddit* rather than an actual community for those affected?
2. Shouldn't it be *if we go down we all go down together*? You are letting a part of the community go just incase the subreddit would get banned or deleted. Isn't that against what we as an ocd community should stand for?
3. Hell, ***if the subreddit did get banned or deleted***, there would be a huge uproar in the mental health community, and people would probably get more educated on OCD and why the banning would be wrong. Banning talk of a COMMON ocd subtype to avoid this type of thing is wrong.
4. The whole point is that there are so many people suffering in silence with POCD. I was one of them! This subreddit showed me i wasnt nuts. *But can you imagine someone deeply struggling with pocd stumbling across this subreddit and seeing that pocd isnt allowed??* **if you are alienating people with POCD to one other sub, it gives ""separate but equal"" vibes.**

The point is that, I know you aren't going to change your decision. It's pretty obvious. But I would still like an honest answer. I get that you don't want r/ocd to get deleted. BUT if reddit decides to delete the sub just because of pocd content, that would cause a much needed discussion. What is the point of excluding others just to avoid an imminent social conversation?

This action of disallowing pocd to exist here is just furthering the stigma.

If you want to read more about this, here's a link to a discussion about this: [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/paod9k/rocd_mods_ban_pedophilia_ocd_pocd_discussion_and/)

what are your thoughts?",48,2022-03-19 20:37:08-04:00,"OCD treatment is pretty much all the same regardless of themes. A big problem with people on here is they post about their theme but don't ask advice for how to treat it. You won't get better that way, ever. ### Yeah I think it's bad to disallow talking about it at all but tbh I've seen a LOT of people using POCD to spam reassurance seeking posts on here and posting about some like... gross shit. And this is someone who struggled with POCD in the past. It really didn't help my obsession to see people talking about the particular ways they were, ahem, 'testing'. I'm just going to stop there. Really gross. If you've been on this sub long enough you may know what I mean by that. There needs to be SOME moderation. ### I also have all sorts of abuse/violence OCD and I also find the rule extremely dumb. The mod claims to be a therapist but is making peoples OCDs even worse by singling out a type of violent OCD

Then again I had shitty therapists ### Yeah, I have some POCD and kinda sucks, least we have the r/POCD reddit ### it just adds to the stigma!!  the community can‚Äôt shut us out bc our ILLNESS isn‚Äôt pretty!!!! it‚Äôs so hard getting help already, this community should be a place where pocd sufferers should be able to find support. we are not pedophiles!!!! we are people with ocd. ### Since when is that theme not allowed? Two years ago when I first discovered this sub we could make posts about any theme, regardless of how ""taboo"" it might sound to the ordinary person. When I was really struggling the people on this sub came through for me. 

New set of moderators are fucking cowards. This was one of the only active places that discussed OCD of this nature; I'm thankful this ban wasn't made when I really needed it. There are so many scared and struggling people out there who need support from this community regarding this theme. ### Honestly i wouldnt vent here because the amount of times i heard someone in here calling others a pedo is wildly more often than not. ### i literally struggle with POCD to some extent and its so dumb how i cant vent about it here ### The mods should be ashamed of themselves. Ostracising people that suffer the exact same illness as them (yes, OCD is OCD regardless of your ‚Äútheme‚Äù) because they‚Äôre scared of big bad Reddit. Shameful. ### rule 6: ""no ocd shaming""  
rule 12: ""no pocd""  


isnt that shaming lmao ### As someone who is familiar with this and has a huge amount of anxiety about it, it's pretty dumb. I have never seen anyone graphically depict their thoughts in a post either, so there is no reason why it should be taken down (unless of course there is something graphic about it). 

Because if reddit somehow thinks ""Guys I'm scared as shit to be around kids. I hate being around kids because I don't want to have intrusive thoughts about them"" is sexualizing minors, they can fuck right off ### I think it weird too considering like 99% of the people on this sub has or is helping someone with ocd, so really who's it offending? We as ocders know all the sub types it comes with so its not shocking to us in the least. This should be a safe place for us. ### I believe it‚Äôs to avoid being flagged by the broader Reddit algorithms. If the admins are alerted to this subreddit constantly talking about desiring children they may quarantine or outright ban this sub to the detriment of *all*. I agree there needs to be a safe space for OCD sufferers to discuss their anxieties surrounding pedophilia, but the mods are confined to the rules of the main site.

Basically it‚Äôs a ‚Äúbetter safe than sorry‚Äù policy. ### I have POCD a bit I think it‚Äôs unfair :( ### [removed] ### To be fair since I joined this sub I‚Äôve seen countless POCD posts but I assume that‚Äôs just mods not noticing them rather than allowing them to some extent. But I do agree with you, it‚Äôs a dumb rule that only further stigmatizes POCD and screams what all sufferers fear. I ain‚Äôt saying shit about the mods cause whew. Don‚Äôt wanna get banned. ### I don‚Äôt exactly know what POCD is, I suffer from contamination OCD, but I assume it‚Äôs OCD related. Anything OCD related should be included in this sub, there‚Äôs no point in dividing us. ### damn ### Ugh, that stigma will make it even worse. Im sorry. You're not alone. ### I believe there is a specific pocd reddit group perhaps it might be worth looking at that? ### [deleted] ### Because of Reddit. Why does it bother you? OCD is OCD the little letter in from means nothing. ### ocd treatment is the same, which is true. but getting that help in the first place is really difficult if you have themes like pocd. i had pocd and my general therapist thought i was nuts. She only knew of contamination. 

I had to learn from online that you should go to a specialist if you have a taboo theme. 

posting about your theme in the first place is like showing relatability. its kind of like a community environment. the healing and treating should happen in treatment since none of us are doctors. ### you are absolutely right in saying that it needs to be moderated, just like any other themes. 

however, my main point is that it shouldnt be completely banned. Just because it is taboo, doesnt mean that just the mention of it should not be allowed at all. ive had pocd and it is a lot of reassurance seeking on this sub with pocd. and the moderators can moderate that. 

but completely shutting out all pocd sufferers is a bit fucked, no? 

but i do know what you are saying, and i have been on the sub long enough. moderators are needed for things like that. But you cant shut out all of pocd, it is a valid theme. 

also just congrats on being alive from one pocd sufferer to another because i know pocd sucks the life out of you and transports you to hell. ### i have had shitty therapists too lol. and yeah this rule is very dumb imo. sorry you have dealt with these themes. ### True, but what is the point of dividing the community ? rocd, hocd, tocd, pocd and other themes all have their own subreddit but they are all accepted in *this* sub... except for pocd. ### that has happened to me too in the past and jesus, its scary. if I was going through my worst parts of pocd and someone said that to me.. i feel like I wouldnt be here. 

but i think general discussion should be allowed? and venting should be allowed? ### agreed. ### totally agreed. ### LMAO i didnt even see that, but yeah ### 100% agreed. They can take down graphic posts by any means. But not allowing to talk about the stigma and things of that nature, around it? Not allowing it to exist as a theme in the sub? super fucked up. ### yes, totally agree! ### it is completely fine i think to not allow the graphic stuff, but the general discussion should not be banned at all. along with that the way that the mods handled the situation was terrible. 

the thing is that this is doing more harm than good. if r/ocd is not inclusive of all themes, it is hurting a hell of a lot of people. ### yeah, i would agree. it is unfair ### Exactly. As someone who's life has been severely impacted by my (non P)OCD, I don't want to be the ""this type of OCD sufferer is more oppressed"" person, but I genuinely believe POCD sufferers suffer on a whole other level, and they deserve to be able to get support from the most active OCD subreddit. If this subreddit was created to help people, it should stick to it's goal and not exclude anybody especially not those who need it the most and especially not over ""IF"" scenarios. But that's just my opinion.... ### POCD is a subtype of ocd where one gets taboo intrusive thoughts. these sufferers are intensely fearful of their intrusive thoughts being real or coming true, and it is ocd at the core. In the same way that someone with contamination ocd is fearful of spreading germs, getting ill through that, or some variation. ### yeah dude ### there is but its kinda dumb how a whole pocd subreddit is allowed but arent accepted here in this subreddit ### If we‚Äôre gonna go the ‚Äúwhat if it triggers others?‚Äù route might as well delete the entire sub, because what if reading about someone‚Äôs obsession eventually makes *me* obsessed? 

While CSA is certainly a very sensitive topic, so are incest, murder and rape in general. Yet those themes aren‚Äôt banned. 

Trigger warnings exist for a reason too. ### The fact that you're conflating having OCD with being a victim of child SA like people with POCD couldn't also be and you don't think people woth POCD should be able discuss their intrusive thoughts bc that might be triggering to you is bizarre and lowkey entitled. All intrusive thoughts go against our values, morals, desires etc. What about the self harmers on here who could be triggered by someone discussing their intrusive thoughts to self harm??? At the end of the day, mental health subreddits should not have to censor certain topics and the true ugliness of mental illness and human suffering. The exclusion of those who suffer most because you personally don't want to hear about it is cruel. ### I know what you mean it just seems the majority of posts here are ""does anyone else"" and just general reassurance seeking which is a compulsion that is making them worse. ### I‚Äôm not disagreeing, just saying at least there‚Äôs some space. It should be allowed here ### Dude the sheer panic that would run through me id simply combust. And i havent been called that here but by someone ik irl and i wanted to kms. ### Also in general, all forms of OCD are treated the same way: exposure to the uncomfortable situations within reason and training the person towards being comfortable with the unknown/uncertainty. pOCD is not different. ### The thing is, the admins aren‚Äôt really going to care if it‚Äôs graphic or not. They‚Äôre more interested in protecting *themselves* from liability. It‚Äôs an extremely shitty situation exacerbated by society‚Äôs general feelings towards topics surrounding pedophiles (think of how common it is for radical conservatives to call their opponents pedophiles).

I think the only real fix is to guide pOCD sufferers towards resources outside of Reddit so as to maintain this sub‚Äôs visibility across Reddit while also providing resources for those who need it.

This is not an all or nothing situation. ### [deleted] ### thats true to be honest, but yeah a separate issue. ### totally agreed dude. ### oh god, im so sorry. a while back someone made a post, and a self proclaimed P commented under it and said something along the lines of ""that's how it all started for me... dont be afraid of your sexuality""... and even though it wasnt my post, I FELT LIKE JUMPING OFF A CLIFF THEN AND THERE!!! 

xx sorry we have had these experiences, god. ### First off, I am a child SA victim myself, so don't spin this around on me. You say this subreddit is a ""safe discussion place for sexual abuse victims"" but it's NOT. It's called r/OCD ... you know... for those with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder to discuss their issues and recieve support? Where in the OCD diagnostic criteria does it say ""child SA victim"" anyways??? The entitled bit came from the fact that you think this subreddit is a safe space from your own personal triggers. Wanting to exclude POCD sufferers from it when every other type of sufferer has their own intrusive thoughts that cover a variety of potentially triggering topics, is just unfair. Many people here have non P OCD and aren't victims of child SA... but you didn't ask to exclude them. This subreddit was not created solely as a safe space from your own personal traumas. ### ",334,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/ti94ib/why_the_fuck_is_pocd_banned_here/

tiv08t,"OCD around coincidences and recognising patterns So I have OCD that is triggered by coincidences. I then have to keep track of these coincidences by then making a physical note. These coincidences make me extremely anxious as it makes me feel like they‚Äôre special or I‚Äôm special which then leads me to try and rationalise them and to realise that everyone has them. 

I won‚Äôt go into much details or examples but I‚Äôll give a few. For example, seeing people I know or recognise when out even though I realise this happens to everyone. Or if am similar thing has happened to someone else (e.g., someone lived on the same street as I have, as well as having also lived nearby somewhere else I also lived). 

Another example of how petty it is is that I‚Äôve been messaging someone and have noticed that before I start replying, I‚Äôve noticed they‚Äôre online (on WhatsApp), then when I‚Äôve messaged them I‚Äôve then gone on and noticed they were also online (after I replied) then again when I‚Äôve gone to reply to them, I‚Äôve noticed they are online at the same time. I‚Äôd also like to note that we both aren‚Äôt quick to reply, so it is not like a set time after messaging sent that I‚Äôd expect them to reply or vice versa.

It's not unreasonable to check in once if she's out for a while/going out at night or do the 'hey text me when you get home safe' thing.

But if you're blowing up her phone and asking repeatedly where she's at/what is she doing/is she okay then it's inappropriate. At that point yes you need to just sit with it. ### Checking on her, for you, is a compulsion, so you need to abstain. Don't do it, at all.

But, you're not supposed to just sit there and take the anxiety. You no doubt ruminate a lot and that needs to be controlled and stopped. And you need to focus your mind on other things. ### I think it's fine to check in, but if you keep in constant contact while she is out, that's a problem. ### I felt this. I go through this hell every time my girlfriend goes out without me. It's so intense and scary and overwhelming. I'm sorry you're going through this too. ### It's also a question of having healthy boundaries and showing that you respect her space and trust her ability to take care of herself. If you're constantly blowing up her phone it's going to seem controlling and/or clingy. Some people seem to have an intuitive sense of what women will be comfortable with, but when I was dating I had to ask and then stick to whatever she said even though I really didn't want to. You might look into insecure attachment style, abandonment issues and BPD. ### Over the years. All I've learned is asking for reassurance just digs you deeper into a hole.

I'm not on it. ### If you‚Äôre having significant panic more than ‚Äúoccasionally,‚Äù or you feel OCD is a very noticeable part of your daily life they‚Äôre worth a try. 

I was resistant to taking meds for a decade and finally got on sertraline a couple of years ago, and it has changed my life. My OCD isn‚Äôt gone, but it takes a MUCH larger stressor for me to be significantly affected and I‚Äôve had only maybe two panic attacks in this time, vs. at least monthly before. I feel like the top layer of my OCD has been scraped off and that the me underneath is free again :)

SSRIs are usually the med docs try first for OCD (especially sertraline as it is known to work particularly well for us), and they are very safe and relatively cheap medications. You don‚Äôt have to overthink trying them out too much as if you don‚Äôt like what you‚Äôre prescribed, you can always try another SSRI or just stop taking them if they don‚Äôt work for you. They are not addictive.

However, going onto SSRIs and switching SSRIs/coming off of them can be a sort of uncomfortable, awkward couple of weeks for some people, so if you choose to go onto them it can be a good idea to start/stop new meds during weeks that you don‚Äôt have any super important plans you don‚Äôt want to feel a bit gross during.

I found my meds make me a little sleepier than before, so I was also given Wellbutrin to give me a little more energy, and that ended up being a perfect combo.

I‚Äôm going to assume just from your profile that you live in North America. 
According to the CDC, only 1 to 3 cases of Rabies are recorded in the United States every year. This would mean the chances of you having rabies are literally (approximately) 0.000000009% chance you have rabies.

You are actually 533 times more likely to win the Jackpot lottery.

I know OCD can be infuriating and can fuel your anxiety, but it‚Äôs always important to take a step back and look at things from a realistic point of view.

If you haven‚Äôt been bitten by any raging wild animals or drank any infected blood recently, you‚Äôre safe lol.

I wanna relive my childhood and buy used consoles, but I don't like the fact that other people have used them with their potentially contaminated hands, and the potential of getting a bug infested console.

It might be a step in the right direction to curing my ocd if I just go for it though.",9,2022-03-20 19:29:58-04:00,"Hi I have contamination ocd I just bought 2 jeans from the second hand store I just gave them a double wash as opposed to one wash (which I do for my own or store bought clothes) maybe wipe the console a second time but be sure it stays at that .

Btw were you also hesitant to buy secondhand for a while, or were you always fine as long as you double wash/clean more thoroughly? ### I don't know other than it doesn't feel adequate enough. Maybe it's because there's still the thought that someone else's germs/bodily fluids were in contact with whatever secondhand item I want to buy, and that no amount of rubbing alcohol would reverse that.

But yeah after disinfecting it with rubbing alcohol there's no actual harm that can happen to me, so I'll just try to ignore my ocd and go for it. ### Yes I would‚Äôve never done so in the past . what happend is that right now I have outgrown the majority of my clothes and my parents just helped me pay for ketamine treatment soo we can‚Äôt really afford to be throwing out money like that.when I started getting anxious I just re frame my thoughts and think about how we‚Äôre saving money my hardworking parents can have a lil extra sum to buy something for themselves.

tixshw,"Don't know what is supposed to count as clean any more So I have a mix of harm, responsibility and contamination ocd.  I obsess over things I may have done that could pose a danger to someone else through either my negligence or an accident.  This gives contamination ocd a perfect place to take root and oh boy has it ever.  My biggest issue is at times when doing stuff, it's not completely clear if I just caused something to be dirty or not.  Like spraying the sink down at the end of the day, sometimes there is some water that splatters up and on other things.  That water could still have soap and other debris in it since that's why I'm spraying it down.  My ocd tells me I have to look for every bit of the splatter and ensure it didn't get on the bag of chips on the counter or the fruit or the dishes drying off to the side or even in the dog's food or water bowls.  I feel if it did there could be harm done and I would be responsible.  So I am compelled to spend way more time cleaning up.  But it doesn't seem like others worry about this type of thing.  Are they just more careful spraying the sink or when they're cleaning than I am?  Do I just notice it more than they do and so I end up being cleaner than others because I see it and do something about it? A part of me things that this ""splatter"" is just harmless overall and I should just let it be.  But ocd says it could contain harmful bacteria or chemicals that someone could ingest and get ill.  I don't know the answer but so far I've believed that it's better safe than sorry but if this is what it takes I am not sure I want to really engage in cooking or eating stuff on dishes because the cleanup is just so time consuming.",11,2022-03-20 19:24:19-04:00,"I do the same thing friend. I think others don‚Äôt care‚Ä¶meaning they don‚Äôt give it a second thought. And I think they live through it. I try to accept some of it and just wipe the faucet and immediate sink around like the width of my hand. But geez it‚Äôs so hard I know. Anything that has to do with chicken never gets rinsed. Straight into the dishwasher it goes. So all the rinsing is done in a safe closed space. I don‚Äôt have a lot of answers. I‚Äôm dealing with the same thing. I worry I will make my dog sick too. She has food allergies and what if some splattered on her bowl or on the floor and she licks it? What if I make her sick? What if I make my husband or my immune compromised (transplant patient) mother sick or heaven forbid die. I haven‚Äôt hardly seen my mom since covid because I‚Äôm so terrified of killing her. It‚Äôs pathetic really. I‚Äôm trying to get it under control. But man it‚Äôs hard. But hey, I licked a spatula today so there‚Äôs that! Progress lol. Disgusting progress for an even more disgusting disease. I hate my brain. I get so angry at my brain that I use that anger to fuel my progress. I hope your therapist can help you. ‚ù§Ô∏è ### As someone without this particular issue, I simply just don't care. I still care about clean, but I don't focus on perfection. What I do is use a scrub brush and dish soap and scrub out the sink until I know I've touched everything with the scrubby, not perfectly, just knowing soap has touched it is enough. It takes me about 10 seconds to 'clean' out each side of my sink, then another 10 or so to wipe up the outside of the sink (only about where the sink meets/sits against the counter top). ### Thanks for your reply. Lol, yeah chicken is the most feared meat of all for me.  Sorry to hear about not being able to see your mom.  I'm sure it's very difficult. I have had similar issues with covid and not wanting to get my mom and others sick.  She (and everyone else in my family) have way more tolerance of risk than I do so it's hard.  I now see a lot of my covid behaviors have been at least partially ocd-motivated.  I feel I have to warn or tell others when there is a risk I am uncomfortable with them taking.  Back to pets... I have 2 very healthy dogs and their water and food bowls are right next to the kitchen sink that is kind of on an island.  I am even terrified of spraying foaming dish soap toward the sink for fear some of the spray lands in their bowls.  I am sure it wouldn't harm them but even the thought of giving them a minor upset stomach is too much for me to risk.  I put my self in their shoes (paws?) and how would I feel if people were spraying chemicals and dropping all sorts of debris constantly that could potentially land in it?  I'd not be too happy about it.  I wish we could move it but then again my family and I have had it this way for 15+ years with different dogs.  But then I think well, one of our dogs has had a few seizures almost every year he's been with us (8)... and my mind goes to ""well maybe it's because his water is right next to the sink where stuff is getting in it?"" yeah, thanks OCD for that thought and for giving me a new obsession.  ugh! ### If you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please do not hesitate to talk to someone.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/OCD) if you have any questions or concerns.* ### Thanks for replying. Just hearing you explain this gives me anxiety!  Maybe this could be useful for exposure.  How do you wash away the soap in the sink?  Do you use a sink sprayer attachment?  I am terrified of the thing because I don't know where the stray droplets of water/soap are going... it's almost too chaotic and I feel like it just randomly lands on stuff it shouldn't.  So I take a cup, fill it up and pour water down all sides of the sink.  It takes forever and I hate it. ### I get it. All of it. Ugh. As for the dog bowl just remember dogs ‚Äúfloor surf‚Äù looking for the tiniest crumb lol so they are used to coming in contact with all this stuff. Also we use dish soap to clean wildlife after oil spills. Think of all the chemicals those poor ducks came in contact with and it‚Äôs the dawn that saves their life. Also when we bathe our dogs I have no doubt the ingest some soap as we rinse their face so must do in their mouth. Heck my dog will lick her nose because the soap smells good. She love to lick legs after a fresh application of lotion. Also a biggie‚Ä¶.dogs eat their poop and vomit! Try to remind yourself of these things when ocd tells you otherwise. ### Oh goodness haha, contamination is the furthest thing away from my worries. Honestly sometimes I just leave the soap bubbles until they dry up.. if I'm feeling fancy though I may fill up my hands with water and just throw it over the soap bubbles ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è No one in my house has ever gotten sick from my lack of care, I also grew up in a house where everyone did the same thing as I do now and we all turned out okay ish. Sometimes I just flick my hand under the water while it's running until most of the bubbles are gone and call it a day. Feeling excessively fancy, I let most of it dry and then Windex/papertowel so it looks nicer but that's it. ### Thank you.  This certainly helps give me perspective.  I know my fear of is way off base and I need to learn to let some stuff go.  I did have some success with that today as I decided I can't live walking on eggshells and as humans we have to leave some kind of trace of ourselves behind when we eat/cook/clean.  It's just the way it is.  I think our society with all the fear mongering media and the perfect DIY home shows leads everyone to believe we should be living perfectly immaculate lives and it's just not realistic.  Kind of like instagram/facebook warps people's perspective of others because people only show their best side which is many times scripted and not like the way it frequently is. ### So true. I have contamination ocd but my house doesn‚Äôt look like it lol. Granted I have no touch zones and clean zones and the whole house is a no shoe zone‚Ä¶I have papers everywhere and three blankets on my living room floor right now and groceries I haven‚Äôt put away and dishes that need cleaned and some that are drying that need put away and bottles of all sorts of lotions and potions on my bathroom counter. Oh‚Ä¶and dust. Tons of dust. I hate to dust. Hate. So yeah it‚Äôs messy and that‚Äôs not even counting the dog toys or books I am reading or crochet projects I‚Äôm working on or receipts I need to file or‚Ä¶we‚Äôll the list goes on and on and on. Sure some people love perfectly perfect lives but I know many don‚Äôt. My life is messy no matter how hard I try. 

One of my favorite phrases is comparison is the thief of joy. 

There is no point of comparing yourself to anyone else because you are you. And maybe they are comparing themselves to you but in a totally different way you don‚Äôt even see as superior to them. It‚Äôs all objective. Just do your best that you can for today and that‚Äôs all you can do. ‚ù§Ô∏è ### Totally relate to the no touch zones and clean zones.  I've found myself creating more and more ""zones"" over the years in my home and it means my world is shrinking which is frightening and needs to be reversed. ### Thankfully I just have one no touch zone as of now yay‚Ä¶no touch for anyone‚Ä¶it‚Äôs my dirty dishes landing space where everything waits to be loaded or hand washed. But I do have an area in the bathroom I don‚Äôt like my husband to touch where I keep my face towel. I don‚Äôt like people touching my clean clothes or towels etc. I can touch it with clean hands but no one else can. What a joke huh?ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I feel rude too.  But I guess I have places that if they are touched I need hands washed like the trash can area and dirty laundry area. I really try to not add more because it is hard to undo them. ### ",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tixshw/dont_know_what_is_supposed_to_count_as_clean_any/
tiqp1o,"Riding the high of good times... gonna do something ballsy today. I'm going to go to a (small) concert. Anybody else got small victories to share? Today's the day. I've put off deciding if I would got to this concert all week. It's just small, with a local rock band, but I haven't been to a concert since 2018 or so. Partly that's due to Covid but mostly that's due to my OCD and PTSD which both get worse in crowds.

But recovery's been... slowly working in the right direction, and today, I feel safe enough to do it. So I'm going to do it. And the show is small so I know I (shouldn't) get overwhelmed. (I hope.) But if I do, I have a plan to leave, and I'm bringing my vape so if I just need a short break, I can go out, have a smoke, and calm down. Get back in the zone. That's all the plan I'm allowing myself. No rituals. No fussing. Nothing I can worry about. Just go there, get it done, and come home like anyone else would.

I'm nervous as hell, but I'm not giving up. Here's to live life like everyone else in the world, and taking back the things I used to enjoy.

But I'm so hopeful that I can get back into some of it now. :) Even if bad times come again, and I'm sure they will (bipolar will ensure that if OCD does not) I think it's vital to take the opportunities for joy when we can. Save those memories up for the times when it's too hard to make more. ### That's fantastic! I'm so happy and proud for you, that's real progress. Yeah, sitting with the anxiety is always so stressful. Good to do, but stressful. Here's to success! :)

So thank you for sharing your victory with us so we can cheer you on & you can cheer us on! ### PS.. you rock just like the band. Keep telling yourself that as you rock out. Make up your own lyrics in your head. 

‚ÄúHey you, look at me, I rock! 

I am here! Yes I am, I did it!‚Äù

Or ya know whatever words come to your head. Just keep them positive and rock on! ### Wow, small world! And thank you so kindly - same to you - wishing you strength, peace and joy. Yeah, one of the hardest part of both OCD and Bipolar is that even in the good moments there's always the knowledge that the bad times will come again. I've had to learn to treat it like seasons. Winter comes and goes, but it doesn't last forever. So value the spring while you can, and make the most of it. Makes no sense to waste the spring being angry at the winter. Just enjoy it while you can, and hunker down through the rest of it. At the very least, it makes us into pretty tough cookies. :) So there's something like pride in oneself to be found in that. :) ### Same to you, same to you. We're both kicking butt today and we deserve to feel good about it.

I almost babied out at the last minute because my first uber got lost and cancelled the trip on me (all my careful planning, nooo) but I just ordered another uber! And I got in a bit late to the venue but it was fine and nobody cared! And after an hour of psyching myself up, I talked to the nice lady at the bar and ordered one non-alcoholic beverage *with a lime wedge* like an actual human adult!! And on the way home, my uber driver said he thought my outfit looked cool!!!

As I was there, I had this thought of 'this is what life could be like more, if you keep fighting your OCD' and honestly, I'm never going to stop fighting now. It sounds funny to say, but I genuinely feel more proud of this moment than I did of finishing my thesis. It would sound ridiculous to anyone who doesn't understand OCD, but that's how powerful it feels to get one over on this thing.

Your brain can trip you up because you can get aroused - you're imagining something sexual, and no matter how disturbing it is your body can get aroused. I ended up getting aroused many times. It tripped me up a lot. But it doesn't prove your fear. I'm a teenager, and my psychiatrist looked at me in the midst of my breakdown after I asked her if it proves it's true and they literally just shrugged, saying you're a teenager it's expected. 

Essentially I don't know what's a groinal response or not. Some people say it's just hyperfocus and not arousal, others say it's just unwanted arousal. What I believe it's just whatever unwanted feeling you get that you don't want. OCD messes you up big time so try stopping the compulsions, rumination, and seek professional help because OCD is a monster wanting to ruin your life. It will get better!

I was really drunk (as most people were) and at some point, I went to the bathroom than went back outside. later, probably around 30 minutes- an hour later, I walked back inside with my buddy to leave for the front door and while we were passing the bathroom, a load of anxiety hit me like a train. Thoughts flooded in my head of ‚Äúwait did something horrible happen in the bathroom and I just don‚Äôt exactly remember what because I was too drunk‚Äù. Quickly, I tried to remember why I could be panicking. The girls bathroom was before the mens so scenarios of me going into the wrong bathroom by accident and then doing something horrible came flooding in. If you‚Äôre  like me, you might have an idea of the kind of things I worried that I might have done while intoxicated. Wait, I remembered, there was security stationed at the bathrooms, there‚Äôs no way I could have been allowed in. Before long, however, I remembered vaguely looking at a girl crying. Could I have seen a a girl crying in the bathroom because of some evil act I did. No, there‚Äôs no way, there were security. But what if, for some reason, the security guard stepped away, allowing me to do something horrible and that‚Äôs why I have a vague memory of a girl crying in the bathroom.

I had almost an identical experience. I always drank too much bc I felt so nice to have that relief from intrusive thoughts. I went to PCB with a ton of girls from my sorority and guys from a fraternity. We all rented a house and we had a night where we stayed in and partied. I drank way too much which I always did bc I loved the escape from the thoughts. The next day I was sick to my stomach that I had done something embarrassing. It felt so real even though all my friends told me that I didn‚Äôt do anything.

I quit drinking completely at 25 and committed to ERP therapy using an app called NOCD. My life is significantly better. I was considered a ‚Äúhot mess‚Äù and a party girl in college even though I was super popular. I dated ass holes and had constant stress and drama in my life. I was miserable.

tijex1,"Is anybody else mad at their psychiatrist (and the mental health system in general)? I have had OCD most of my life and it has been sheer hell. I have also spent all of that time reading and researching my condition so I could be proactive in dealing with it. However, I am no psychiatrist and so I have relied on mental health professionals to provide the right treatment. My OCD had reduced but had never really subsided despite being on medication and having therapy. I have been in the system for over 20 years. Recently though my medication was upped to a higher dose and my intrusive thoughts vanished and my general sense of anxiety disappeared. When I asked my Psychiatrist about it they said, ‚Äúoh yeah it‚Äôs been well known for years about the efficacy of this drug‚Äù. I was dumbfounded because I have been in emotional turmoil for years, desperate for a cure. Every time I saw the psychiatrist they listened to me share my story, nodded, sometimes they empathised but other times were dismissive e.g. I talked about my propensity to binge eat but they just said ‚Äúeverybody does that from time to time‚Äù however the medication has put a stop to that too. It would have saved me ten years of compulsive eating. Now I‚Äôm in the obese category and my health is not in a good place. This could have all been prevented. It‚Äôs like no one cared or shared my sense of urgency in dealing with this thing but they were more than happy to take my money and let me continue to suffer in silence.

I saw four therapists and a psychiatrist before being diagnosed despite going to therapy for a very obvious compulsion! ### Psychiatrically, I was on the wrong meds, for the wrong condition (misdiagnosis) for over a decade. Physically, I've had a chronic pain condition which no one has taken seriously until 2021, probably for about 17 years I've had that.

In both cases, I wound up self-medicating, with alcohol for the mental illness and with a metric fuck ton of Advils and Tylenols which did nothing for my physical pain except give me chronic intestinal ulcers. The stress of it all on my mind and body caused me to develop IBS which is likely to follow me for the rest of my life. 

For all the doctors I'd gone to, the first person to ever take me seriously was a talk therapist. She wasn't trained to deal with OCD or any of my physical issues but she was the first person to tell me stuff like 'your anger at your situation is justified' and 'a thought on its own isn't evil, and having intrusive thoughts isn't your fault.' She convinced me to reach out to a psychiatrist and while my current psychiatrist isn't perfect, she got me on anti-psychotics, which have saved my life (I was bipolar/psychotic/OCD. They'd been treating me with SSRIs for generalized anxiety, which did nothing but made me impotent, have memory problems and permanent brain fog, and be dangerously depressed.)

It's taken me altogether almost 20 years to get my life to something even half resembling normal. I still can't work, I don't date, I can't socialize easily, and I'm still barely hanging on on the bad days. 2/3rds of my life have been like this.

I mean this sincerely: FIND YOURSELF A HEALTHY OUTLET FOR THE ANGER. If you let that shit fester, it will poison you with so much cynicism it'll fuck you up. I bottled my anger up for so long that it made me just... miserable. Horrible to be around. Bitter. I'm unlearning that and it's been great to realize I don't have to feel like that anymore, but it's made me aware of how unintentionally draining and hurtful I was to people, because I'd had my trust broken so many times by people who were supposed to 'help' me.

You're absolutely justified to be angry at the way the system has failed you, but try not to get caught in the trap of 'what might have been.' That shit is soul-crushing. Don't let their past incompetence sabotage your future. You deserve more than to carry their legacy of apathy around on your shoulders forever.

The psychiatric system is confused and corrupt.

Ask God for help with this. He can heal anyone. Ask in Jesus‚Äô name. ### Well that sucks. But I think that's about your specific doctor. Some are much better than others. It's good to see their reviews online beforehand. Not really watch for good reviews, just absence of bad ones. I couldn't be happier about my doctor. ### I need to wait six months to a year before I can properly be assessed, but I‚Äôm definitely worried about my mental health and worries being completely written off like this. ### The problem with the experts is they‚Äôre only trained in theory. They have no idea how we *actually* feel. They just know it‚Äôs hell.

Edit: it took me 12 years to find a decent doctor. I feel like it‚Äôs partly because this doctor is part of a new generation, the older generation doesn‚Äôt see OCD as a huge issue where I am located. ### I believe that both religious help and psychiatrist help are good sources.

I‚Äôm not a professional of course so take this with a grain of salt, but I like to view all the tools we have in treating OCD as exactly that: ways of treating or addressing the anxiety, instead of fighting with it which is what obsessions/compulsions/reassurance/ruminations do. Breathing exercises typically work by activating the parasympathetic nervous system, which helps in relaxation. Medication, ERP, going outside, exercise, breathing, etc. are all ways of constructively lowering anxiety through treatment, so they all work well together! I mean, not in a sense where, in the moment that you‚Äôre actively practicing holding with the anxiety, that you breathe as a way to AVOID doing the ERP exercise (as that‚Äôs avoidance). But, breathing when you‚Äôre feeling anxious (or even when you‚Äôre not!) is not counter-productive, just another way of directly managing OCD! ### No!

tiwanh,"hi! I was wondering how to/if I should get help hello! This is my first time using reddit! I came here because I've been really confused, and I think I might have ocd. To keep it short, a few months ago I wasn't doing that well lol, and basically had a bunch of racing horrible unwanted thoughts/fears taking over my life, and did stuff to help ""soothe"" myself. This mostly was tons and tons of reassurance,  praying/bargaining with my mind? (it's hard to explain but every time I would get a bad thought I would try to make up for it, religiously), and a lot of rumination and checking. I also counted and did other stuff which I'll talk about later because it's really odd.  
This all happened about a year ago, and I want to talk about what it felt like, because it kind of feels like I've been stuck in a whole lot of confusion, and was hoping for some guidance.   
So it started with racing unwanted thoughts around the middle of the pandemic, and it was about things that were I thought was morally wrong. I'm not going to get into it as much as the others because it's pretty shameful and disgusting. I even thought that my family members would be taken away as a punishment. This was ""soothed"" by the praying/bargaining thing. On top of this, I was really scared about the pandemic (like everyone), but it got really bad, and I was really paranoid, and I went through tons of reassurance, like to the fact that I made my mom take me to the doctor to check for a variety of problems with my body, and wouldn't be able to get on with my day because I was just paralyzed with fear that I was infected. There was even a time I was convinced that I had eye cancer due to a little spec in my eye.  
At the same time (they all ganged up on me I-) I was stuck with magical thinking, and every time I thought about something bad, I was convinced it was going to happen. For some reason, I only recently picked up on me stuck with magical thinking. I don't really know what to say to this because I've been thinking for a long time how to explain, but it just felt like it was going to happen if I thought it, but it was also more subtle? I'm sorry I'm not making any sense.  
At the SAME time, I was convinced I was on the brink of Death. Even typing this terrifies me, since I still  am getting over how much pain this part caused me. Every day I would tell the people I love that I love them, and I think the reason why I had this part was because of the fact that this part felt like a punishment for the racing unwanted thoughts. I prayed so much to ""soothe"" this, and I had something where I would rub my fingers against the lines of my hands.  
A few months after this, I had a weirder soothing thing for the fear of being poisoned. When I even smelled/applied something like shampoo, my brain was convinced that I ingested it. This happened with things like dishsoap, so I couldn't even go into the kitchen. The weirder soothing thing was spitting out all my saliva. That's literally it. A kinda funny part of this though was this spitting thing was also occuring when my mom brought home goat milk soap, and I was literally terrified of it, but my mom was so fond of the smell.  
And then I remember one day after holding myself down (like when you get confident that the irrational things aren't real, but then hold yourself down, because you're scared that you got to cocky and now the fears are coming for you) I literally felt like I've done so much, so I didn't react to the bad thoughts. Supposedly, that's how you're supposed to treat intrusive thoughts. It gave me a break from the unwanted thoughts but I still feel a little guilty.  
Around this time, I found out about what OCD was, and I went insane researching over and over. I had come back to my reassurance period and re-read the same articles, and re-watched the same videos over and over again to convince myself I had OCD. However, it didn't work. I convinced myself that the only way to prove that I had OCD was to check my emotions, and see if my unwanted thoughts were fitting along with those with OCD. I was constantly checking my emotional reaction to everything. (To which, you'd guess) my emotions stopped functioning correctly and my intrusive thoughts just left. It had even gotten to the point where I'd force myself into stressful situations to try and get the unwanted thoughts to come. I literally drank so much coffee hoping it would spike my anxiousness. I still feel like a loser after that, especially thinking about how many people suffer from anxiety, and I was trying to collect it like seashells on the beach.  
Then everything went numb. The only thing that maybe indicated I had OCD was maybe my rumination, and at that point rumination took over my life, where I was basically analyzing my past behaviour to see if I had OCD.   
Months later, I got a counting compulsion. I'm not going to mention the numbers since I heard it can cause people's compulsions to start? But basically it was basically tons and tons of repeated counting. I couldn't breathe or think or do anything when the time included certain numbers.   
After that it was the same numbness  
And then recently (like as recent as a few days ago) I kept checking my pulse. If it started slowing down, I would have to do an activity to get it back up, and if it was beating fast then I would panic.   
Now I'm currently nervous about a few things. My parents are very... immigrant. I don't think I could ever ask them for help. I'm not nearly old enough to move out and pay for my own psychiatrist. Typing all of this out (thank you, by the way, for reading all of this) it seems kinda obvious I may have an anxiety disorder, or maybe just spiked but I don't really think that far ahead. I don't want to self-diagnose, but I also don't want to wait years for help. I know I'll have to suck it up, but I'm hoping there's another solution that my stupid brain didn't see.

tiw4y3,"About reassurance seeking When I was starting to do CBT my ex-therapist said that reassurance seeking is repeatedly asking questions and ruminating even if you know the answer (very basically).

While on this subreddit I see a lot of people who think that reassurance seeking is ruminating  or repeatedly asking questions even if you don't *actually know* the answer.

So, what do you think is it?

Sorry if I wasn't clear.",1,2022-03-20 18:04:09-04:00,"Reassurance seeking is asking people (or ruminating about things) to verify if something is right/okay, even after it‚Äôs already known. Like repeatedly calling someone to reassure yourself they‚Äôre alright, repeatedly asking someone if you‚Äôre actually a serial killer to reassure yourself you didn‚Äôt accidentally kill loads of people without noticing, repeatedly asking if the oven is turned off to reassure yourself your eyes aren‚Äôt playing tricks on you and it is actually off or repeatedly asking if someone loves you to reassure yourself they‚Äôre not pretending.

Asking a question you don‚Äôt already know the answer to is just asking a question, that‚Äôs pretty normal, *if* you stop asking after receiving an answer. Like if you were to ask someone ‚ÄúDid you shut the door when we left?‚Äù until you receive an answer, then not ask again, it‚Äôs just a question. If you continue to ask that question after you‚Äôve already received the answer once is when it becomes reassurance seeking. Like if you continue to ask ‚ÄúBut did you really shut the door?‚Äù or ‚ÄúAre you certain it was shut?‚Äù to reassure yourself that the answer was the correct one, it‚Äôs reassurance seeking.

Continuously asking questions with no known answer (like ‚ÄúWhy do people exist?‚Äù) can still be an OCD trait, but it‚Äôs not really reassurance seeking because there is nothing to reassure. Your obsessively trying to answer it, but you aren‚Äôt trying to reassure yourself the answer you already have is right, because nobody has an answer in the first place. At least thats how I see it.

Really the best way to tell is to just ask yourself why you‚Äôre asking that question. If you can say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm repeatedly asking (insert question here) to reassure myself that (insert reassurance here),‚Äù then it‚Äôs probably reassure seeking. ### ",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tiw4y3/about_reassurance_seeking/

These are the things can be described better outside of other categories i listed here. Like if i want to tell you the moment i had an hour ago, i'd call it an intrusive thing. 

Also everything you're having as a part of OCD is an intrusive thing, otherwise you wouldn't be obsessed with them. I learned this myself, there are 2 main things in this disorder: Anxiety and Intrusive Things (Obsessions and compulsions are also followed by them). When you fix/solve/repair/cure or whatever you want to say, these 2 things; there will be no OCD left to stop you. There will only be intrusive thoughts, anxiety and other things you've experienced (and i didn't count here because i'm focusing on these two) as seperate things (most of the time!) and harmless to you. 

I'd like to talk with someone about my previous stresful moment to relief a little bit but i have to sleep for now. If you'd like to listen to me, i'd be more than happy to tell!

tj1eov,"Intrusive thoughts are making me think I like my best friend‚Äôs husband. The title says it all. 
Hi everyone! I (24F) have been struggling with OCD since I was in third grade. I‚Äôve had a plethora of intrusive thought themes, but this one is really bugging me and it started today. 

Some background: my best friend and I have been friends ever since we were little kids (6 years old). I‚Äôm her maid of honor in her wedding. Her and her husband are already legally married, they‚Äôre just having their ceremony. I absolutely adore their relationship and I couldn‚Äôt be more happy seeing her happy with him. He‚Äôs such an amazing man for her and treats her like the queen she is. They‚Äôre such an amazing match. I truly can‚Äôt see either of them with anyone else, but each other. I also truly have never seen her connect with any other guy like she does him and this makes me so happy to see because this is exactly the type of love she‚Äôs been looking for and it‚Äôs exactly what she deserves. I was there when they first met all the way up until they got legally married and now I‚Äôm helping her with planning her wedding. I couldn‚Äôt be more excited! 

In no way, shape, or form do I have feelings for her husband or want to be with him. I even knew her husband before they met and even then I never had any sort of interest or feelings for him. I think he‚Äôs a good guy and we get along very well as friends. He always tells me he and my best friend hope I find an amazing man and that he and my best friend will make sure that the guy I‚Äôm with is a good man who deserves me. I also would never dream of doing something like this to any woman, let alone my best friend who‚Äôs practically my sister. I‚Äôm actually currently interested in someone else, and thinking about this guy makes me so happy and giddy inside. I‚Äôm so excited to get to know him more (he‚Äôs one of my friend‚Äôs friend), however my OCD is making me think I‚Äôm not interested in that guy anymore and that he‚Äôs not good enough and that I like my best friend‚Äôs husband. 

I know these are OCD thoughts, however I just can‚Äôt shake them. But I‚Äôm also scared that it‚Äôs not OCD. Does anyone have any words they can offer me?

Where I live, inspections seem to happen a lot. They are generally not super invasive, but people can be careless and end up touching a lot of things they have no need to. I was wondering if anyone has experience speaking to their apartment management to get them to be more respectful/careful?

thx13j,"The way OCD can leave us traumatized isn‚Äôt talked about at all‚Ä¶ Like i said, the way OCD can leave us traumatized isn‚Äôt talked about at all like there‚Äôs not even a single article about it &amp; it‚Äôs always about the other way around (trauma causing OCD).
OCD will make you lose your own identity, it will make you hate yourself, it won‚Äôt let you get sleep, throw you into a depression, play your worst fears on a loop all the time and more terrifying things. And then it‚Äôs so hard to love and trust yourself after all you went through with your own mind. It‚Äôs just traumatizing.
The fact that I wouldn‚Äôt even wish it to my worst enemy says a lot.",119,2022-03-19 11:02:13-04:00,"I just thought about it recently. No matter if I get better the damage this illness has done is surreal. I've already lost so much. 6 years of suffering daily. The worst thing is that everybody thinks I'm totally fine. Inside me, I'm at war. ### It's a bit like getting gaslit by your own brain. A trauma I'd find difficult to explain to people who haven't been through it, but definitely a trauma. ### I agree, emotional trauma is a legitimate thing and this illness knows how to cause it ### I totally agree with you. I was in a manic episode a few months back and my OCD was through the roof and my only focus at the time. Nobody tells you how you can go back to trusting yourself and loving life again, or how you can ever recover from an experience like that. ### I agree üíØ

Panic attacks as well. Any of these things are not merely symptoms, they are causes of repeated retraumatization. ### I know I feel stupid when I say it out loud but I‚Äôve felt for a while that my own brain has traumatized me so much. It‚Äôs painful. ### I agreeeeeee I actually think about this constantly I can‚Äôt believe how much of my youth has been completely joyless ### Agreed. I feel like I don‚Äôt even know who I am anymore. Looking in the mirror is sometimes scary, but most of the time it‚Äôs sad.

I never dissociated before having a severe OCD break. But half of my days are spent depersonalized, traumatized by constant fear and caution, constant abuse of my own mind for thinking ‚Äúthe wrong way‚Äù. ### I'm in a dump today for this exact reason. I'm feeling like shit because I've been having intrusive thoughts all day. And I'm so incredibly tired and frustrated with myself. I'm trying to read, watch things that I love but some new intrusive thought regarding whatever I'm doing is invading my mind. I keep thinking about other people's judgements about me and the perfectionist inside me is killing and smashing me into pieces. It's very difficult to practice any counter thoughts. I keep repeating the same thought over and over in my brain out of control. I hate this and I'm so worn out. Today is so traumatic and I'm thoroughly scarred ### Even worse: the idea that you can traumatize yourself. ### I agree.  The impact it can cause to one's body, mind, and life is intense.  

I haven't seen it mentioned anywhere either, except for the people who have undergone it themselves.  It left me feeling lost and alone with my experience, like I wasn't ""getting"" it or doing OCD right (oddly enough).  I felt shame, embarrassment, and humiliation for ""letting"" it get so bad.

I wish there was more awareness about the real impacts this disorder can bring.  It can certainly save someone's life. ### Agreed! There needs to be more publicity about this. It's like my mind is traumatizing itself. ### It really is. I constantly replay the moment when it got so bad that I went to the ER (Not even knowing I had OCD) and just how traumatic that was for me.. I like woke up and was never the same again. It's been an extremely challenging and traumatic 3 years. ### This post is so well timed. Lately i've been trying to do a fuck ton of research on OCD so I can clarify my personal experience. Ive struggled a lot with pocd and harm ocd, and so Ive tried to figure this shit out for a long time since both of those themes and my severe ocd overall has left me with literal trauma. 

but youre so right. NO articles about how ocd can cause trauma. No theses, no dissertations, no studies. ### If a person said the things that my brain says to me, it'd be in jail. ### Well I guess since no one else will talk about it, we‚Äôll have to ### [deleted] ### I feel like the best way to describe this is the album ""the wall"" by pink floyd, though not about OCD, it can relate with past fears and traumas coming back to haunt and battle us, and in result we get separated from the real world and encapsulated in a wall, or berrier that blocks and berricades us from future succses, achevements, actually enjoying life, but enclosed in this wall and in that said wall is horrifying traumas, events, and thoughts on repeat over and over and over again, as the wall gets bigger, it feels like there is no escape, this is what everyone masks up as ""quirky"" and ""loves cleaning"" but its much more severe down on the inside, its this internal game of hot potato of what to traumatize next, its scary, and nobody knows. ### Thank you THANK you for saying this!!! I am traumatized and many most of us are!! ### Dude after I got my Prozac increased last year and feeling better and increasing again to 60 and then feeling great... All that trauma building up for decades just hit me. Like I felt better and many intrusive thoughts stopped.. but like I still couldn't move on with my life. And like 9 months later I realize it's because I'm still processing everything how ocd really really fucked me since I was just a little kid. How so much shit was fucked up because so much constant thoughts of anxiety and inadequacy throughout my life.

Even at 60 I thought it couldn't get any better. And I just started 80mg last month and it's like another big leap of relief that I didn't even know I needed.  Even at 60mg when I thought most of the intrusive thoughts were pretty much gone, at 80 it still felt like a weight was lifted off soul and conscience. It's hard to explain because many times ocd is just a bad gut feeling and not really clearcut thoughts.. but the weight being lifted were these shitty gut feelings when I'm just going about my day like expecting the worst to happen all the time. 

It's like how do I process this? I'm almost 40 and you're telling me all I needed was to literally take more pills all this time. And it has formed so much of my identity up until now and it's like now I can be a totally different person? Now?? It's sort of like a culture shock when I never left the country. Everything seems so different even though I'm still me. Identity shock maybe? Is that a thing? Lol. ### Seriously it‚Äôs traumatized me so much ###  Yeah. I have this thought thats in my head that says ‚Äúƒ±f you talk about your fears and your intrusive thoughts too much, they might happen in real life.‚Äù Because of this im scared to tell anything about anyone. I have severe ocd for years and i dont wanna go to therapy. No medications. Just pure OCD taking over my brain. I hate this. Somedays i feel like ive never lived because of the battle in my brain. I wake up, tryna hold my shit together, do stuff if i can and the blink of an eye i have to sleep and this is most difficult part of the day. God. It feels like a curse sometimes. ### It got to a point were I was questioning if I was a good person at all and if all the affections I'd shown my wife and kids was an act so nobody would think I'm evil. If every conversation was a front to hide myself if I told lies to seem interesting and sane. It literally hurts my brain sometimes I believe I can literally feel that part of my brain waking up to cause mayhem  talking to myself like gollum trying to convince myself I'm not bad. ### It has left irreversible trauma that can never be fixed ### This is so fucking true, it really does. I compulsively google PTSD stratergies as I find them helpful. ### It‚Äôs hell on earth ### i feel you. but ive figured that once im well medicated/treated, as soon as the thoughts lower/lift, i start getting my confidence again. So hang tight, we have time on our sides since science is advancing so fast - look for all possible treatments meds etc, and never forget that everyday has new possibilities for new treatments coming our way <3 ### I agree so much and I wish that this was a widely recognized concept on the clinical side of the community because I sometimes feel like I need help from the trauma this disease has put me thru ### I‚Äôm reading all these comments and I‚Äôm just stumped. I don‚Äôt think I can conjure up any thoughts to add. All I know is I relate so much. I‚Äôm 44 and have been battling this for over 20 years. Still sort of scratching the surface. I often picture being able to blow that part of my brain off just like Edward Norton in Fight Club. It‚Äôs a beast like none other. The optimism in me says there‚Äôs a way out someway. It‚Äôs not me, it‚Äôs my ocd. Move forward‚Ä¶ ### I think about this a lot myself lately. Recently I‚Äôve noticed a shift in me, like I‚Äôm not who I once was, and when I pin it to a timeline, my life seems to be divided into the halves of ‚Äúbefore OCD got bad‚Äù and ‚Äúthe hardest struggle I‚Äôve had with OCD yet‚Äù. Not to be a downer, but I genuinely think if I ever slipped that far again, I would not survive it. Trauma caused by OCD is so, so real, and worse, it feels almost impossible to talk about with people, unless they are a sufferer themselves.

I don‚Äôt have an especially positive note to end this on, just‚Ä¶one more voice to say I feel this, too. OCD can be so lonely and hellish, but it isn‚Äôt forever. My heart seriously goes out to everyone in this community. May you all see better and better days. ### I'm absolutely not trying to downplay anyone's obsession themes but living with undiagnosed OCD with the really heavy hitting violent and sexually violent themes for years, or decades, is really fucking traumatizing to go through, and it definitely should be talked about more. I already have some emotional and mental ""religious"" cult induced trauma from my childhood and going through violent sexual intrusive thoughts since 16 years old only added onto the trauma. ### it‚Äôs traumatizing in itself to pinpoint the moment when your mind snapped. i‚Äôve had underlying symptoms since i was a child, but as i‚Äôve hit my early 20s my life has become increasingly difficult. every day is a struggle to exist and i feel insane. my brain is on a constant loop. i feel like i can‚Äôt truly enjoy my relationships and my experiences. it feels impossible and horrific to have this brain. i have always likened myself to a ‚Äúphilosopher‚Äù type but it is so painful. just to exist. i wouldn‚Äôt wish this disorder on anyone, it is agony at times just to be alive. ### Oh my gosh THIS. 

Whatever caused my OCD to start as a kid traumatized me enough to cause OCD, only to be traumatized by my own brain for years later. The fear alone we deal with is the type of stuff people deal with when they have PTSD. It‚Äôs scary. We loose our identities in this. Not to mention the other mental illnesses we all inevitably develop with it. ### It makes me so sad and angry to know how much suffering people who have ocd deal with.
I wish that more people would recognize the day to day suffering and yes, how it has and will continue to be so traumatic, even if the ocd is better.
I worry for my son. He‚Äôs struggling with it, and has now for years. Nobody has ever stopped judging him because of how much it has affected his entire life. I know that I don‚Äôt fully understand, although I have PTSD and depression. At least I know that even though I don‚Äôt understand, I know enough to know that he‚Äôs not exaggerating his pain. 
I would do anything to take this issue away from him. 
I‚Äôm sorry for those of you who deal with OCD.
It just plain stinks that you all have to go through the hell it puts you through:( ### It almost destroyed me

Fuck that tho ### I just want to be carefree I can‚Äôt do things normally anymore it‚Äôs ruining my life and relationships with people ### Well only somewhat. You will be traumatized as long as you have it. Once you cure it, the trauma goes away with the whole OCD. I don't think that's the same as what psychiatrists call trauma. I was like that ""traumatized"", now I'm fine and have no more trauma. Actual trauma wouldnt've go away like that. ### So many battles to fight every day. So many wars 
per year. ### This is so true and the worst thing about it is that I could say so many things about my general day-to-day experience surviving with this disorder over the years and feel like I've barely scratched the surface. ### Yes-I have sleeping problems because of thoughts that play through worse fears/memories. Gotten mental breakdowns from that-had to keep secret from the rest of my family because they expect me to keep a certain tone around them. I have a fear of blood from past trauma and I can‚Äôt look at my face in the mirror for too long or my thoughts will get worse. 

Only when I‚Äôm alone and listening to music or movie trailers or other videos for a while will they stop which has led some people to think that I hear voices though I don‚Äôt. If I‚Äôm in my bed with my headphones on away from the rest of my family watching something, that‚Äôs about the most of a break I can get. ### I can ignore most of my intrusive thoughts but the sexual ones really get to me ### The symptoms may subside with medicine but without it all I can think about is the contamination and the worms. I can‚Äôt look at worms the same anymore, it‚Äôs put such a deep trauma in my brain that even medicated I sometimes still feel infected ### I know. I'm once again in recovery for addiction and my mental health,  and I feel like my self awareness at this point in my life is pretty high. So I just paid attention to my inner monolog as I went from having a good day, to ruminating which is one of my compulsions. It immediately went from making an effort to love myself,  to just straight up hating myself.  

I'm 31 now and have dealt with this most my life. Had extensive Therapy and know erp well. But it's still so often such an exhausting fight.  Just exhausting.  It sucks the life out of me. It's like it puts a Grey filter over anything decent. ### I have been thinking this a long time, i repeat things even in my sleep  but my mind bugs even more in the dreams. ### Yess, nobody understand this. It‚Äôs a huge struggle. I even decided that I refused to have biological children. My anxiety, OCD, and Depression are already bad enough. I know it‚Äôs genetic so I don‚Äôt want to pass it on to my biological children. ### Someone said it!!! So much of my early childhood memories are tainted by how much my ocd traumatized me and ruled my life for so long. The worst part is that no one takes ocd seriously, I can‚Äôt count the amount of times I have to explain Pure OCD to people and how debilitating it is. You‚Äôre not just being gaslit by your own head, but society as well ### I feel this post 100%. Sometime I wonder what's the point of it all, each day is a struggle and a ball of anxiety and depression. As well as worry over all the types ocd I have and thoughts that constantly plague my mind. ### Yes, I never see anyone talk about this! I've been thinking about this lately, especially when it comes to really graphic intrusive thoughts... it's just so much for a brain to process. ### Sure I‚Äôm physically healthy, I‚Äôm in pretty good shape, but it was a struggle not to >!crash my car into an overpass because some voice told me I would survive!< ### I'm 17 and i can't sleep at night i can't smile can't get comfortable anywhere I'm replaying how i should adjust my carpet at night instead of sleeping. I can't go near dustbins even to throw normal things. I'm scared of smells. And i give myself illnesses while thinking about them. And can't get out of this fucking warfare in my mind. ### I think about my past, different scenarios and i can't just  stop thinking about it. Everything has to be inch perfect. Just can't be fucking bothered with it. Just want one day of comfort and a good sleep. ### I've never seen anyone talk about this before and It is a very real and true thing. I spent years suffering in silence, I developed severe OCD once I got to my teen years and It sent me down a vicious loop. I'll never be able to get back all the things It took from me. It sent me into a deep depression and deep guilt from my intrusive thoughts that ruined any image I had of myself, I was at my worst. I got expelled from school, I couldn't sleep, I couldn't function. Everyday was like waking up inside a nightmare. ### I literally wanted to cry when I read this because it‚Äôs so relatable. I was just telling my therapist how I feel like my entire child (23F now) and young adulthood was stolen from me because I had ocd but didn‚Äôt know because I ignorantly thought all ocd was cleaning/counting like most people. The amount of times I was s****** and i depressed and anxious since I was a kid all stemmed from my ocd and that shit is hard to live with. 

My worst theme was existential ocd which basically took over my life for the past nine months because I found the right med. I was literally walking around 24/7 every waking moment in fear that i wasn‚Äôt real or that my family and friends and nature and art and music was all in my head. couldn‚Äôt eat or sleep. sobbing every day driving home from work. Like.... what the fuck? How do I live knowing that this could creep up on me again? 

I guess I‚Äôm writing this to say that I definitely relate to everyone‚Äôs comments and my heart goes out to all of you who are fighting this illness with me. Here‚Äôs to brighter days and joy for all of us üç∏ ### this. I was stuck in a loop of over analyzing everything and anything, creating false memories, constantly revisiting topics that trigger me, convincing myself I was a horrible person over intrusive thoughts/feelings, etc for months. It even affected those close to me; my friendships, family life, my relationship took a hit too. Some tried their best to understand and constantly reassure, but I feel bad about how it overwhelmed everyone. That said, I envy those who can let go of a moment with ease. Meanwhile my whole world gets flipped upside down and I can‚Äôt allow myself to be present at all. Not until it blows over and who knows when that‚Äôll be. ### Not sure where you read ‚Äútrauma causes OCD.‚Äù That‚Äôs not fully accurate.
And the way to get past OCD is to stop dwelling on it. ### EXACTLY!!!! It‚Äôs an everyday battle, outside i can look like im fine, healthy and everything, but on the inside im literally in hell every single day. That‚Äôs traumatizing ### Facts. I also was thinking about that. OCD is a real war inside your mind. Be strong! ### This is so accurate, I‚Äôm so tired of everything, I just wanted to be happy ### There is a video of a horror narrator on YouTube and he talked about a friend of his who suffers with it. They thought on a specific day they were going to hell, (because they said the name satan) and they could not function or sleep or anything for weeks. They finally got the diagnosis of ocd, but listening to the horror they had to go through was terrible because I know what they were feeling like and they had to go through all at for weeks until the day came and when nothing happened they felt relieved, but they know they needed help.

Just the misery of suffering through it undiagnosed was horrifying to hear. I don‚Äôt remember the video but the YouTuber is Killer Orange Cat.

It reminded me of all the times I was in middle school and I thought something was going to happen to me because xyz and it made it so hard to function. At least I know now to be aware for my kids when I have them. ### Yes this. Feels like something else is controlling my body. ### How do you even open up about it? I tried today well not about ocd but my codependency (i got combo hurrah) and I instantly start feeling like a weirdo. So how on esrth im actually supposed to talk about it????? ### Please tell me you practice ERP or at least know of it x ### Exactly it‚Äôs so hard to explain it to people who haven‚Äôt been through it. ### And it affects so many parts of your life. There are places my bf likes to go to--certain hole-in-the-wall restaurants, friends' houses, etc. That I FLAT OUT REFUSE to step into because I'm too afraid. 

I realized this past week that I haven't been home to see my dad and stepmother and beloved nephew because of my ocd, for almost 5 years. Covid was part of not seeing them for the past 2. But 5 years total. I miss them but I'm terrified of going home. That's brutal. ### The way my OCD makes me question if i‚Äôm overreacting/if what I know happened actually happened is insane. It‚Äôs like an obsession all in itself. ### Holy shit that is a good way to put

It is fucking hard to explain what ocd is like, but yeah, gaslit by ur brain is a good way of putting it ### THIS!!! ### > they are causes of repeated retraumatization

This makes me sad. ### Same, i even made a post some months ago asking people if they felt like ocd gave them a ‚Äúmild‚Äù trauma, i said mild because since I‚Äôve never seen anyone talk about how OCD can traumatize someone, so i used that word to not sound dumb or to not sound like i was talking about something I don‚Äôt know about‚Ä¶. but it‚Äôs definitely not a mild trauma, I can‚Äôt even move on. ### I relate ### Exactly!!! ### Do you not have them everyday?

Mine are all day long, everyday. Sometimes my past,future, or I can even find something new during the day. ### right!!!! ### THIS!!!

Same, I was told I was under taking my xanax. I was so worried about being labeled a drug seeker, especially with my history with alcohol. ### SAME, I can‚Äôt speak about my fears either because of that same reason I can‚Äôt even say it with my mouth to myself because i feel like it will become true. ### you‚Äôre not diagnosed??? please get help, it was hard for me to talk about my OCD i went almost a year suffering alone & undiagnosed til
I couldn‚Äôt anymore like i was mentally and physically sick, then i talked about it and i finally got diagnosed & the doctor gave me the meds which helped me calm my anxiety. ### Right!!!! It‚Äôs impossible to enjoy anything, im just glad that I wasn‚Äôt born with it, i feel for the people who had it since they were kids, it must‚Äôve been traumatizing. 
I started having OCD symptoms at 13/14 and it fully developed at 15, i miss my life before OCD i wish I would‚Äôve appreciated it more. ### Exactly!! ### THIS ### Cure is a strong word. OCD isn‚Äôt cured but it is easily controlled. ### To be honest i feel like i first will have to ‚Äúcure‚Äù my OCD and then the traumas, it‚Äôs a lot of them that I don‚Äôt think about that are still on the back of my mind and they can come at any time. ### THIS ### This!!!! ### Omg i was thinking about the same some days ago, i feel like i would pass my mental illnesses to my kids and I don‚Äôt want anybody to deal with this ### EXACTLY ### THIS!!!  It‚Äôs like OCD wants everything from your past to be perfect!! I know that feeling so well omg ### This is literally me right now‚Ä¶ i feel like my OCD has robbed me of my teen years that‚Äôs why I can‚Äôt wait to become an adult already im so fucking tired, i started showing OCD symptoms at like 13/14 years (I wasn‚Äôt even aware) and i fully developed it at 15 and it sent me into a deep depression too, i was quiet about it for almost a year until i just couldn‚Äôt take it anymore, like i was suicidal‚Ä¶ and then i spoke up about it, and medications did help me. ### I couldn‚Äôt imagine having OCD as a child, that shit must be super traumatizing, like it‚Äôs literally robbing you of your childhood, and existential OCD is so fucking depressing ### No i was talking about there being articles talking about if Trauma could cause OCD, but not the other way around. ### Exactly :( just feeling shame and intrusive thoughts about the worst fucking things that I'd never want to do, that I don't even want to think about as well as reliving my own traumas via intrusive thoughts and their themes. I feel so much older now, and not in a healthy way ### Now you reminded me once when I was 12 I tried to kill an owl to end her the suffering she was going through because someone knocked her down heavily. I was praying to god and begging him for months not to kill because of what I have done. When I got on a plane I would again prey not to fall down. I always thought some higher force will punish me due to the act I committed.  
Now that my OCD is full blown, only now can I see that it started very early on but realised it 15 years later. ### this ### I know about it but don' practice and don't take meds. At least not yet. ### Sometimes I think I‚Äôm fine, and I have been recently, but I think right after that how that one time I wasn‚Äôt and how hard I was derealizing from being in my head so much and I‚Äôm like oh ya, that happened lol ### Right!!!!!! Avoidance, it‚Äôs a symptom of trauma & OCD too, i know how you feel. ### I know how you feel. It's been almost 3 years since I've been home because it just seems like too much. Last time I was there I didn't have ocd, now I'll be going back a totally changed person:( ### Yeah, I totally get that. I had a realization a while ago that my brain just won‚Äôt let me exist as I am naturally‚Ä¶like my brain literally will not allow me to think a single thought without questioning it, and thinking that thought in 10 different ways, and therefore never being able to come to a conclusion on what I am even ‚Äúallowed‚Äù to think‚Ä¶sounds crazy, I know. Idk how many people have that specific experience, but it totally breaks you down as a person. I just think it‚Äôs so crazy sometimes how OCD can completely diminish‚Ä¶everything about someone. I am getting better to some extent‚Ä¶not looking for pity, just sharing experience. But yeah I can‚Äôt imagine many people would mentally be able to handle OCD without some level of trauma, to be honest ### Same, no memories. ### Sometimes they last for days. Sometimes not. I can never tell. On trumatic days like that I can't even think about confronting and challenging my OCD. I can't practice any counter thoughts. It's so severe I shut down. ### I understand.  It's hard to function when your brain's pretty much out to get you.  That's what it feels like for me.  My mind seems more interested in finding all my weaknesses and hounding me with them all day, everyday.  For years.

I lost myself years ago and it was, and still is sometimes, painful. ### It's difficult because i don't have the resources that i need to be able to receive help with my mental health at this moment in my life. ### I don't think that's how it works, since the trauma is a symptom of OCD and therefore should stop being on your mind after you succesfully treat OCD. ### People doesn‚Äôt even understand that at all. They kept saying that I should have biological children smh. My brother and sister can keep building the family line for my dad. Beside I‚Äôve always wanted to adopt children since I was a kid. There‚Äôs TONS of children wanting and needing a family to care for them. ### Bro my past and everything has to be perfect i have to say the perfect words and i have to make zero mistakes in everything.  fuck OCD man. ### If you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please do not hesitate to talk to someone.

Thanks üòî",4,2022-03-20 17:40:04-04:00,"I've had this compulsion to a very small degree in the past and felt the same way - if someone else is around, it doesn't get so strong.

I have other suggestions I can make but I'm afraid of those becoming part of your compulsions, so I'd rather not share those. ### Sooooo the only way I was able to stop checking all the windows and doors in a certain order in the house was when I had a child of my own and I became so worried he would get old enough to notice what I was doing and then he would normalize the behavior.  It was super hard and if someone leaves a door unlocked during the day I still have to.

I have cut out all compulsions for over 3 months now, but I had a doubt.

I'm not OP, but for me, a combo of rationalization and making a conscious effort to be kind to myself helps me with my thoughts. E.g., last week I had an intrusive thought that I'd left my clothes steamer plugged in while I was on my way to work, and had a powerful urge to turn around to check. The rationalization was that I remember unplugging it, and even if I forgot, it would take a very unlikely chain of events for that to start a fire, and nothing bad ever happened the times I did forget. The kindness to myself was that I'm not a careless idiot like my mean brain tries to convince me I am, and even if I forgot one time, it wouldn't mean I don't care about safety. I didn't turn around, and I didn't think about it for the rest of the day until I came home, saw it was unplugged, and was proud that I didn't waste 20 minutes to confirm something I already knew. It's small, but it's something.

I'll be the first to admit that meds were necessary for me to get to this point and to take the worst edge off the thoughts and urges so that I was capable of responding rationally instead of being totally overcome by emotions.

Congrats on your three month streak!! And congrats to OP! ### truthfully i don‚Äôt know. i think it has helped that i‚Äôve been going to therapy and working on accepting doubt. also i think i reached a breaking point recently where i‚Äôm desperate and will try anything to minimize the presence of ocd in my life. i have had this one obsession for a long time and as scary as it is to accept doubt, i‚Äôd rather run the risk than spend the rest of my life in the state i‚Äôve been this year. it‚Äôs been really hard and i‚Äôm totally gonna relapse again but any progress is good progress. ### but also, when the thoughts come up, i mostly just try to distract myself. sometimes it takes a while to realize when i‚Äôm starting to ruminate but i try to redirect my attention to literally anything else. also, one thing i did a lot before i was able to go this long was delaying gratification. when i felt the urge to check, i would tell myself that i had to hold off for 15 minutes and if i still wanted to then, i could. over time i was able to delay it for longer. i‚Äôve also found that occasionally just delaying it can lead to me getting distracted and not doing it at all. 
i think the last thing i tried that made a big difference was trying to avoid my triggers. i know this definitely won‚Äôt work for every subtype, but literally hiding twitter away in my phone so i wouldn‚Äôt see it has made a big difference.

i hope this is helpful! you‚Äôve got this. ### Thank you so much!

tiyqsx,"Im in a very confusing position and I need suggestions. Hi this is my first post as a reddit user, I'd like to share my story and see if anyone can relate to what's going on in my life. So I have self diagnosed my self with OCD after reading and researching about the symptoms in the internet, my main symptoms are counting (for example I always count how many sips of water I drink) and another symptom is repetitive thinking. I was never bothered by this in the past and it never gave me any anxiety, what happened was 1-2 years ago an incident was I broke up with my girlfriend, and I couldn't stop thinking of her (I was also smoking weed like everyday), thinking about her were my only thoughts literally everyday 24/7, I would check her social media, I would check when she's online etc 

What I did to solve this problem was research on the internet about how to stop thinking about something that you can't stop thinking about. I read a lot of articles, which were explaining that the things you want to resist will persist and that you should just observe your thoughts and just let it sit there, this seemed really interesting to me so I started researching more about mindfulness and anxiety etc.

That's when the problem begun, when I started meditating trying to just observe my thoughts, what would happen is that I would have no thoughts flowing, I tried just waiting (in a sense looking) for what thoughts will pop up but nothing came up and that troubled me, it gave me anxiety that when I just observed my thoughts I had no thoughts, so I started panicking, I thought that something is wrong with me and the reason I have no thoughts must be anxiety related. So my plan was to find a way to get rid of this anxiety.

So while panicking my research for anxiety begun, I scraped the internet fully, reading every article, and post I could find about anxiety and how to get rid of it, my first method I tried to get rid of it was to ""accept it"". I hadn't grasped my mind around what accepting it means as I was in panic mode the whole time about the fact that ""I had no thoughts"" so what I did was I started repeating to my self ""I ACCEPT MY ANXIETY"", now here is the ocd part, I wouldn't just repeat it once a day, I would do it constantly and by constantly I mean literally second by second, I would do it until it felt right and sometimes it did and it lasted for maybe a minute and then I would start again. What gave me even more anxiety was that I would forget what I was repeating in my head when smoking weed and I would literally panic, when I forgot the sentence my heartbeat skyrocketed and I had to research in the internet again to find another sentence to repeat to my self or I needed to remember what the sentence before was. 

During the time that I did the ""repeating"" I disconnected from the world, more specifically I started being distant from my friends, I would talk to them nor open up about what I was dealing with, talking with them would be exhausting as I was always in my head ""repeating"" so I started to develop social anxiety, I also started being more distant from my family and basically everyone around me and then my new fear became social anxiety and I had to overcome it, so I researched it as well, I read a book about it but nothing would help. In the end I realised it might no be it.

A year later when I was mentally in a bad position (still ambitious to overcome whatever I was dealing with though) I realised that repeating sentences to my self needs to stop, I realised that this is what's causing the anxiety, so I stopped. My mind though was so used to that habit that even if I wasn't repeating a sentence in my head, every few seconds it would just flashback to the thought of ""I need to stop repeating"" and it would still bother me and give me anxiety. 

That's when I said I have to put an end to this cause its making me life hard, so I started researching more and more until I read about ocd and I related to it a lot. Reading about it and understanding some things about my self was a huge relief, but it still hasn't cured my problem. I forgot to mention that when I stopped ""repeating"" I felt like I had completely forgot how to think, basically what I mean is I forgot how I thought before that and what my interests were, I forgot what I was thinking about and how I was thinking about it which still to this day gives me much anxiety and troubles me a lot. 

I still feel like I need to solve this problem in order to get my life back, I researched everything on the internet but nothing has helped me. I haven't been to any kind of therapist before but I'm keen to try it out. If anyone is dealing with the same thing or has any suggestions please reply to this post or DM me.

I often find myself spiraling down a train of thought and i will visualize what they did together and it‚Äôs horrible because it‚Äôs like im watching it but i can‚Äôt turn away and i can‚Äôt stop it. I will literally sit still for like 15 minutes running through different scenarios of them together and it‚Äôs horrible.

I feel like i did this to myself by asking too many questions about his past relationship but i feel like that was a compulsion as well. I don‚Äôt want to be the jealous type but i can‚Äôt help but feel sick to my stomach after i think about them together. I know he has no feelings for her and im not worried about my relationship in that he will go back to her or anything like that but i can‚Äôt help these thoughts and i hate it and im worried how THIS may impact my relationship because i feel like im always insecure about it and visualizing it and comparing it.

Every time i try to just let the thought pass by i can‚Äôt let it go and i just latch on to a scene. Im just at a bit of a loss as to what i can do at this point because i really am happy it‚Äôs just these thoughts will put me in a mood for a day or i‚Äôll get upset with him for no reason and i just don‚Äôt know what to do. 

Does anyone have any advice on what i can do? Im not too well versed on ways to treat intrusive thoughts so if anyone has any recommendations i‚Äôd really appreciate it!!

tixx0v,"does anyone else experience this? Hello! So I have pure O OCD and sometimes my intrusive thoughts are not always specifically about myself but they‚Äôre just like horrible, disturbing things in general. After a bit of overthinking I always find a way to ‚Äúmake them‚Äù about myself but what happens often is they somehow project onto others? It‚Äôs kind of hard to explain, what I mean is: let‚Äôs say I have and intrusive thought about hurting my cat. Sometimes if I can‚Äôt calm down I would overthink, and for example look at my mom. Then I have the thought: what if my mom hurts my cat? 

It just really sucks because I feel even more guilty about them since I have the thoughts about someone else, who I would never-ever think badly about. 

I am very curious - because I couldn‚Äôt find anything about it online - if anyone else has these? If you do, what‚Äôs the best way to overcome them?

tipz2b,"Advice for Death anxiety OCD? Hi all,  

One of my worst obsessions is loved ones dying - not being able to get the image of people I love dying out of my head, playing it over again and again, etc. I don't so much get compulsions, but a lot of rumination. And my aunt's pretty sick right now (not something she's *likely* to die from, thankfully), which is of course making that fear worse. Now I'm even more worried someone's going to die, like I'm just waiting for that news. I'm having panic attacks over it and trying my best to take my mind off things and socialise making sure I don't just sit around and wait. But it's constantly at the back of my mind, and I'm trying not to force it out because I know that won't help. It's hard to enjoy anything, the worst part is that at some point someone will die, so it's not an unfounded fear, just that worrying will make zero difference. I don't know really know how to calm it down. It's not like with compulsions, where I can attempt to not act on them, but running round in circles in my mind.",2,2022-03-20 13:21:21-04:00,"If you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please do not hesitate to talk to someone.

tixc02,"Irrational fear of being drugged Hi there. I‚Äôll begin by saying that I haven‚Äôt been officially diagnosed with OCD, though it runs in my family and I suffer from an anxiety disorder. 

Anyways, a few years ago now I had a horrible experience after smoking weed. It scarred me so badly that I haven‚Äôt been able to use anything since, including alcohol, though I never had a bad reaction from drinking.

Recently though, I moved away for school and these irrational thoughts began that everything I would eat or drink was laced. I would panic, and then convince myself the panicking was the drugs beginning to kick in. I have stopped eating foods that are popular edibles (e.g. chocolate bars, brownies, etc.). I even had to quit smoking cigarettes cold turkey because I had a fear they would be laced with weed too.

timn1c,"Prescribed Zoloft for Intrusive Thoughts Hello,

I have been having constant Intrusive Thoughts running on a loop literally every other thought non stop for a little over 3 days now. It is at a point now where both yesterday and today they have put me in a  constant state of anxiety and stress which I never had before because I fear the thought will come up again (even though I know it automatically does) which perpetuates the cycle.

I have tried distracting myself with activities which prove futile as the fear persists and thought keeps looping.

Some context: 4 days ago I went to mass for lent service and (I'm Catholic by the way) as I was in the service, I looked over at a statue of Christ and out of nowhere a very graphic and disturbing image popped in (sexual) involving Christ. At first I was just taken aback by it as I was thinking to myself why did this come up but as the days went on that same image keeps popping  back. 

For about 2 days now the image is on a literal thought pattern loop and has latched on to my other anxiety provoking thoughts and, as mentioned above, has put me in a permanent state of tension.

I try to do anything I can to distract myself but they wont stop. I tried accepting it and letting it float in my head and not worry about it but I just keep thinking even more about it and the moment I stop it's back on a loop, like a broken record that wont turn off. 

I feel like I am going insane. I went to the hospital and they prescribed me Zoloft, although I dont know if that will help me and the side effects are pretty scary.

I am honestly lost of options and I do not want to kill myself out of guilt or shame but as of now I see no escape. 

What have you done to remove these intrusive thoughts for good or at least make it a non issue so you can function normally?",7,2022-03-20 10:46:59-04:00,"If you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please do not hesitate to talk to someone. The wonderful u/froidinslip has

Can you access treatment? ### I‚Äôm a Catholic as well and have experienced similar intrusive thoughts. It‚Äôs very distressing. Sometimes SSRI can make things worse before it gets better.

God Bless ### I would highly recommend ERP - it usually has extremely successful outcomes. ### I‚Äôve always had ocd since childhood, but these last four years have been awful, especially this last year.

Originally a video was made on how this specific user on reddit was obsessively posting about quantum immortality and things of that nature, and how they wanted to die because they couldn't figure out the concept of life and immortality and shit like that. 

People suspected he was crazy, or had schizophrenia, or a severe psychotic illness. Some really truly scary shit.

For most of my life I thought myself of nothing but a heterosexual guy and it felt right to me.

Couple months later of overthinking and I got scared that I might be a girl from the inside giving me T\*CD. I'm not really a manly man but at the same time I don't feel feminine either.

tibkzm,"obsessed with 'starting over' I've always been obsessed with starting over, ever since I was a kid. I would think to myself ""tomorrow is the day that I am going to be perfect and happy"" on repeat. I always feel like I can't be happy in the moment and instead I have to wait for myself to be perfect in order to start my 'real life', if that makes sense. Like my life is going great right now and i keep thinking ""tomorrow when you wake up is when your life will start"".

Obviously this is a major problem for me, especially because it makes no sense to anyone else. I just want to be happy and live in the moment and not worry about anything else.

Has it gotten any better for you, or have you found anything that's helped at all? ### This is very difficult. Difficult even to tell exactly. 

I realized, on reflection, the similarities between the social anxiety, depression, and OCD, and found them rooted in what I called socialization. Please don't take this seriously though; I'm still figuring this out. 

This socialization is the amalgamation of the judgements of one's culture, upbringing, morals, school, et cetera, lodged in one's mind. When there is deviation, there is pain. Then one is whipped back into place. This goes for thoughts and actions it seems. 

The key, maybe, is to destroy this chip. I recall how Einstein, in I believe it was a draft for an autobiography, wrote of how he grew a skepticism to every social environment after his religious de-conversion. That might be a way. 

I'm still suffering a lot. I'm suffering plenty right now. Each and every time I take the bait, it gets worse it seems. I did take the bait a couple of days ago. The pain is a sort of fatigue, an inability for the light of intelligence to dominate, to have that eager energy. I'm skeptical, however, even of this claim; it could be something else. 

I went for a walk earlier and thought that I might just seek to distract myself into clarity, then let things proceed from there. That might work. I saw a post on Quora of a similar nature. 

In a sense, it has gotten better. Now I don't sit and recite ""anthems"" to myself in some ""holy"" place like a bedroom or bathroom anymore. I walk straight out. I don't even look at myself in the mirror. I just have to make sure there is no deliberate intention such as ""Once I walk out of this door, this is it."" In fact, not even this. The last straw, it seems, is the reading. I keep reading and rereading. It's exhausting, since I have basically memorized entire parts of works. Today, I caught myself starting the works I'm currently on from the beginning again. I rebelled, and started later in the works. Maybe instead of these static rules, going spontaneous and dynamic might work. After all, isn't dynamic a super set of the static? 

Forum pages have helped. This site has helped a lot. It made me realize what is going on. Otherwise I might have thought everything a fault of my own, a fault in a never ending loop, instead of something not-normal. I stopped taking escitalopram with the hope that doing mathematics, computer science, philosophy, and everything from there would align to wipe out the nonsense. That this would bring a contentment though first, maybe, maybe not, a battle. Reading *Daybreak* also was profound, especially those parts that so capture the problem. In fact I think all these illnesses are evidence of a greater problem, a problem that seems to be untouched, and rarely discussed, and which has perhaps not even been discovered. It might be sociological. 

I'm grateful that people are willing to document their experiences. It has been very helpful. 

What works for you? How bad is it? Once again, thank you! ### I hope that all of us are able to find peace. The things that have helped me are a combination of meds and also the Plum Village app. ### ",28,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tibkzm/obsessed_with_starting_over/

tiuhj8,"Dating with OCD I have a great girlfriend right now, plain and simple. She's kind of a pan, alt gamer girl you see in all the memes, but it's ok because I'm kind of an emo, gamer, CS major. She's nice to me and I love her, and the feelings are mutual. We both have our own mental problems, hers being more depression/schitzo and mine being more ocd/anxiety. 

Recently she had to go on a week vacation with her family which was fine, but she was preoccupied so I couldn't talk to her much. During this time, I had an INFLUX of obsessive, negative thoughts. Questions kept popping into my mind that I had never really asked her. These questions relate to ex boyfriends, sexual experiences, etc. Everyone who's ever dated a significant other knows these questions suck and a lot of people have them, but I could not stop my mind from obsessing over answers. Now that she's back, we were together hanging out, but the questions kept lingering. I ended up being honest with her, asking if it's ok for me to ask these types of things. We talked about them, and I felt better. However, the conversation prompted MORE questions, which I asked about the next day. At this point, she sad the specifics I was asking were not necessary, and that it only hurts the both of us. 

She doesn't feel comfortable, which is fine! These boundaries should never be pushed. I feel like these kinda of questions really aren't necessary. It's not a jealousy thing, but more-so I need to know who I'm dating and I need to know they are ok. Past experiences tell a lot about someone, and if you don't know, then you could accidentally recreate it in the future. After the second conversation, she got sad/hurt and I think she doesn't want to be around me right now. 

However, my OCD is really getting to me right now. These questions, I think, are important for a relationship. At the same time, who cares if you had sex once before(to a certain degree of number of times), who cares if you've had 2 bfs or none? Who cares if you've played a game with an ex before playing it with your current lover. I feel like realistically I can live without the answers, but that doesn't mean I wont be bothered by them. The OCD aspect is what makes them not want to go away. I've had therapy for my OCD before (I used to repeat sentences or words in order to 'say them right' or a certain number of times and I used to not be able to go into certain rooms without thinking of something first or in order to leave), but I've never had it interfere with a specific relationship before. 

What do ya'll think about this? Is this a normal relationship, or my OCD getting the best of me?

Tell her that it is currently manifesting as obsessions over all of these questions about her, and that if you ask her a question that she thinks is leaning into the OCD, she should tell you ""I think this is your OCD. I'm not going to answer that question."" It is going to SUCK, I'm sure. But the best thing for you would probably to be not to even ask the questions (you can already see that your OCD thinks of more things to ask if you do), or, if you slip up and ask, for you to catch yourself doing it and say you don't want an answer, and/or her not to answer it (not ignore you, just not answer the question). ### She does know, but I hate 'blaming' things on my OCD. We all know it's not an excuse, BUT to your point, I would really appreciate some help and patience before she feels targeted. The ONLY thing stopping me from just completely not caring about anything my OCD thinks to ask is that I feel like one day, I would ask something that is super important. 

For example, I gave my girlfriend my blanket that I made a few years ago. My mom showed me how and it was kind of like a bonding thing. I would use it when I was living alone, but I wanted my girlfriend to have it so she has a piece of me with her the nights I can't be there. If she were to have a blanket that she uses that her ex made for her, honestly I would feel a little uncomfortable. Obviously maybe it symbolizes something, and frankly I wouldn't want to be laying with her using it because I find it weird. If she did have a special blanket and I was thinking about asking her how she got the blanket, I would be so grateful to have asked if that was the answer. 

That example kind of sucked, but i think you get my point. What if I miss out on info I should have just because I ignored a question my OCD manifested? ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tiuhj8/dating_with_ocd/
tioopg,Honest question I have asd and ocd the asd is black and white and doesn‚Äôt like uncertainty and the ocd hates it more how I suppose to live a life like this ?,1,2022-03-20 12:23:15-04:00,"First of all, big FUCKING mood. ASD and OCD interact very weirdly and it's not fun. I don't have much in the way of advice since I haven't solved this problem myself but here's a tip that might help... 

Looking for things that *are* certain is good, and choosing to focus on them. OCD itself becomes a routine after a while and you can recognize its patterns. Your obsessions/fears/memories might never be certain, but what *is* certain is that you have OCD, and it'll usually behave consistently and predictably. 

For example: I have horrible hypochondriac OCD. I see an odd spot and feel compulsed to check it over and over and the intrusive thought that it might be skin cancer. I can't be certain of illness. However, this has happened to me *so many times,* that I *can* be certain that this is OCD. Thus, I can behave in a routine manner: wait it out, don't act on compulsions, with the knowledge that I'll calm down eventually. 

TL;DR: You can be certain that you'll be uncertain, understand its cause, and have a solid consistent routine for how to manage it. 

I wish I had more for you than this and solidarity. ### ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tioopg/honest_question/
tilf4k,"Did Meds Ruin Me? i was diagnosed about five years ago, mainly for ruminating and using anger to control situations.  It is a late life diagnosis, at 50, the result of an unhinged angry rant at work.  I have been through a series of meds, which have had mixed results.  For a few months, I went off and then felt bouts of anxiety.  Now, I am off again.

For decades I have had a sadness on Sunday afternoons, when the weekend came to a close and work loomed.  I enjoy work but it can be stressful.  I teach and i am sensitive to criticism from my admins, parents and students.  Of course, I focus on the negative and feel I can never be enough.  Recently, I realized that sadness (what I have called ""the Sundays"" since I was 23) was actually anxiety.

So, I've had anxiety.  But, what I consider ""normal"" low level, periodic anxiety.  It does not seem to run my life.  I have had few panic attacks, and only since I've started meds.

And that's the thing.  While on meds, I never felt my level of anxiety diminish.  In fact, as I've gotten older my job has created more anxiety.  Some of that is the changing nature of public education.  Some is COVID.  Some is my own damn desire to fix every student.  Add watching our society fall apart and go authoritarian.  But are those changes talk-therapy solutions or are the meds supposed to be doing more?

And now I am getting the periodic panic attack.  My fear is the meds messed up my chemical balance and things are now worse.  My therapist says that when I find the right med it all clicks.  Perhaps, but I've tried five or so and at best they level, at worst they've shredded my short term memory/recall and given me tinnitus.  I'm not looking to blame--meds work for so many friends and improve their quality of life.  I just want to adjust my expectations as I live without for a bit.  I cannot remember if I've always been like this and just never paid attention or if this is the new me.",1,2022-03-20 09:46:54-04:00,"I've always heard the typical response from many people that I need to keep trying different meds. I've tried 7 or 8 meds, and none have got rid of my ocd. They have just made it so its not EVERY second of the day. Currently now no meds work, and I do indeed wake up with ocd and still have it until bed time.

tiklte,but why? why or what evolutionary or psychological/physiological reason does OCD and the guilt exist? Why does this exist? I had severe childhood trauma. Why did OCD develop as a result?,3,2022-03-20 09:03:42-04:00,"I am in NO WAY a doctor and am kind of talking out of my ass here, but I remember reading a medical article once about comorbidity of PTSD and OCD being about 30%. PTSD, some people think, has an evolutionary function mainly because of hypervigiliance. 

Like, imagine in nature, a rabbit with hypervigilance to avoid predators lives - a rabbit that doesn't constantly check its surroundings gets eaten. It's a similar thing. And for all it can be crippling, it can also protect you (sometimes) in the horrific situation. My dad has combat PTSD which is a good example of this. As a civilian, it doesn't help him, but as a soldier, it did help him to be alert/aware of danger.

If OCD can develop from/be comorbid with trauma, then theoretically, it could be like traumatic episode = hypervigiliance = SOMETHING MESSES THE HYPERVIGILANCE UP INTO SOMETHING IRRATIONAL = intrusive thoughts = compulsions to 'protect' yourself. Maybe? That's me guessing. I don't know for sure, but it seems plausible.

I'd love to hear an actual professional's opinion on this though. I've always wondered if some of what we see as mental illnesses aren't so much illnesses as evolutionary maladaptations. ### My therapist said it's from avoidance. The more you avoid something on purpose, the worse it gets, you think about it more.

tifosf,"A question about past mistakes So basically, I said a lot of things I never should of to other people when I was an older teen. A lot. We all laughed at it because we thought it was funny, and then I came to realize what I said was absolutely wrong, and am ashamed of it. I don't talk to those other people anymore (we were friends) and now I have new friends who I love dearly. The issue is that I've told a few of them about my past, but not all of it. I haven't told them all of it because it is deeply embarrassing and I know they would no longer want to be friends with me anymore if I told them, despite the fact that they were understanding about the other stuff I told them. The reason why I ask this in this subreddit is because I have real event ocd, and I am constantly thinking not only about the things I have done, but about how cowardly I am for not telling them. 

I am planning on slowly cutting them off from my life  by not talking to them/seeing them anymore. Sure, they'll wonder where I am, but I feel as if it is better that they don't have to deal with me anymore because of how I was, even if I believe I've changed (which, I personally believe isn't something I decide. I think other people are the ones who judge whether you've changed or not). I just wanted to know if anyone else thinks that me not telling them and facing the consequences is cowardly, and if cutting them off is a good thing to do, because I seriously cannot tell anymore. I'm afraid to lose them, as they're the only people I've ever felt I can truly call friends, but I made the decision to act like an asshole, and so I feel as if whatever price I pay is deserved. Any thoughts?",13,2022-03-20 03:23:05-04:00,"I don‚Äôt have a answer but I want to let you know that this is extremely relatable for me! 
I try to think that I don‚Äôt expect every person in my life to tell me all their sins, so why should they expect that from me? ### I have a question for clarification. Do you want to cut off the old friends or current friends? ### I really understand you. I have OCD and my brain is also tormenting me with memories. I always find new reasons why I am a bad person and every time this reason seems fatal to me. At first I tried to fight it, justified myself, and in the end, again and again, I found new reasons for self-humiliation. Then I just realized, that it doesn't make sense! Why should I do this? Yeah, even if I am bad person, what should I do? I cannot delete all my memories and of course, nobody can change your past, but you can always help other people, correct your mistakes and enjoy life. I advise you not to run away from the memories, do not try to justify yourself, cause OCD will always find a reason for anxiety. Be yourself with all your mistakes and bad deeds, and if your new friends are good friends and you feel OK with them, so why you have to stop spending your time with them? They shouldn't know everything about you, and you shouldn't know everything about them. That's ok, everyone has their secrets and personal problems. Just enjoy time with your new friends and don't let OCD ruin your life like this. But anyway it's your decision and only you can decide what's better for you. Wish you all the best! ### ALSO! I want to clarify that I am not trying to ask for reassurance, and I apologize if that's what it looks like. I just want to know if this seems like a good idea. ### Very true ### Thank you for your response. My issue is that I just... don't feel as if I deserve to continue forcing myself into these people's lives if I know what I did would make them dislike me. I just feel like a coward. ### New friends! I have already apologized twice to the old friends for my behavior and cut them off. ### Also it's not that I want to, it's something I feel I MUST do. ### Hey OP, I think this seems like a very bad idea. Everyone has done and said things that they are not proud of. The most important thing about your post is that you are talking about what you've LEARNED. If one of your friends came to you and told you that they said or did what you are so worried about, you would be very understanding and recognize that people change, learn, and grow. As your friends would do for you. The urge to confess is a compulsion; you do not need to confess to being young and ignorant. You are being much too hard on yourself, and isolating yourself will make things worse. Do you have a therapist? ### I understand your struggle. And I feel like that myself a lot. If you had a friend who had done something horrible, and now know that it was wrong, would you still dislike that person? It‚Äôs important to learn from your mistakes but it sounds like you did. However I understand how you feel. ### Well you said you love them dearly so I say keep them. You don't necessarily need to tell them your entire past if it's embarrassing. I think your friends will accept you even if they don't know all of you. ### Sorry just saw this reply. I still say stick with them. Don't isolate ### It's both embarrassing and just... offensive. I look back at my younger self and wonder how I could ever become so horrible and that's why I'm confused as to what I should do. ### ",8,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tifosf/a_question_about_past_mistakes/

It seems you are reluctant to accept that you may have OCD. Have you sought a proper diagnosis? ### I can give an example to see if it sounds like something OCD related or if it‚Äôs just like anxiety or normal:

Just an example ### I haven‚Äôt. It‚Äôs just feels like a very big step to actually talk to medical professionals about it.

Thank you for your answer. I‚Äôm going to read up on those things you mentioned. ### It's probably not necessary to get medical/psychological help unless it is causing you distress, or if it happens to get worse. There may be other ways OCD could manifest in your life, too. There are plenty of resources out there to help you recognise the signs and learn helpful ways to respond. ### I mean the issues I face does bother me a lot unfortunately.

It‚Äôs just I dont know how to explain to medical professionals to get the full picture. Also I‚Äôm kinda scared of the potential results idk it‚Äôs stupid. ### Panic attacks suggest you do need treatment...

saying that, essentially, you're fine with putting this sub at risk for deletion so you feel included is shortsighted in my opinion. especially considering there's a whole sub for people with pocd. since the topic is a lot more sensitive than sexuality or contamination or whatever else, it needs to be treated sensitively. 

i don't think many people with legitimate ocd look at those with pocd as morally less than. i think that idea is coming from inside, since ocd already causes a lot of shameful feelings. like, do you believe people with religious ocd are automatically morally better on the whole? anyone who's suffered from ocd knows it's not by choice, & it sure as hell doesn't mean anything about who you are other than you're someone suffering from a mental illness. ### I don‚Äôt understand how you feel this is ‚Äúputting the sub at risk for deletion‚Äù ‚Äî no one is saying to graphically describe intrusive thoughts.

When I struggled with this issue, I found that Socratic questioning was the most helpful technique to (1) carve out time to process my feelings, (2) apply my anxious energy to a productive task, and (3) give me an end result of ""wise mind"" processing, which acknowledged my emotions but didn't let them control my thoughts or behavior. My therapist gave me a worksheet similar to this one to fill out when I was struggling with this kind of anxiety: [https://www.therapistaid.com/worksheets/socratic-questioning.pdf](https://www.therapistaid.com/worksheets/socratic-questioning.pdf)

You're already acknowledging evidence that your catastrophization is inaccurate (the calm demeanor, reassurance, etc.), so your mind is already equipped to do this. Try it and see if it helps! If you're not in therapy, I'd recommend it so you can experiment with other anxiety management tools that you might find helpful. It takes practice, but this kind of processing can become second nature! ### ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tijaxw/freaking_out_over_upcoming_conversations/

Recently I had a friend, who is very progressive about mental health and openly discusses their ADHD and depression, say this. They mean so well, and maybe they do have OCD, but dear god it is such a yikes to me.


Like imagine someone saying that about any other compulsion besides organizing. Picture of the locked car door (8 times locked) ‚Äúmy ocd loves that‚Äù. 

Also like, it doesn‚Äôt love that? It requires that. The soothing from compulsions only furthers their need and I would never consider them something that makes me happy or calm. Idk, just really struck me that people still say it so flippantly. Severe OCD can take over an entire life and even mild cases take intentional and deliberate treatment. Should I say something in these instances? How to do that without being a dick, since it‚Äôs obviously something I‚Äôm quite passionate about.",15,2022-03-19 14:03:43-04:00,"Omg ikr!

It‚Äôs the same people who say ‚Äúoh your so bipolar‚Äù if someone has mood swings or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm literally gonna have a panic attack right now‚Äù casually from someone doesn‚Äôt know what severe anxiety is actually like. Or using psychotic to describe someone toxic. It‚Äôs 2022 people have we really not progressed at all? Cmon. Maybe try telling them about how OCD is for you and it‚Äôs not just cleaning and hopefully they‚Äôll actually listen ### Ugh same.

I really wanted to say something but I didn‚Äôt want to start a fight at work. The way people use mental illnesses as a casual funny personality trait bothers the shit out of me - and it‚Äôs always bothered me even before I was diagnosed. ### I've started calling people out on it, although in a kind manner since I realize they rarely mean any harm by it. A quick explanation of why it's inappropriate usually makes them really understand. No one is ever shitty about it either because they would have to be pretty audacious to argue with an OCD person about it. ### I always comment online when people say things like this, but never in person because I‚Äôm too scared to. I usually say something along the lines of ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt what OCD is and it‚Äôs a very harmful stereotype. Please refrain from using it as an adjective!

But she told me her organizing was OCD yet she‚Äôs never been to a doctor to be checked for it. ### I haven't corrected anyone since I've been diagnosed and I definitely used to use this phrasing in a similar manner before I knew how crippling OCD can really be. I'd be careful because others with OCD might still say it as a defense/coping mechanism, but I'd simply inform the person and say something to the effect of ""Hey - not sure if you have it but OCD can actually be very crippling to those who do. If it's just that you prefer to be organized, but it doesn't cause you anxiety, you could say 'I'm particular' or 'my desire for organization finds that so satisfying!' instead. If you get anxiety over things not being organized, that might be worth talking to someone about because that could definitely point to OCD. Otherwise, that phrase is belittling the effect the disorder can have on people."" A bit wordy but you get the information and a few suggestions in there without being condescending while getting your point across nicely. I think people still have a habit of saying it because, unless you have the disorder or have seen it first hand in others, you don't really know what it means. Ultimately, I don't think it would hurt to matter-of-factly correct someone, especially if it's someone close to you. This sounds like you wanting to set a boundary, which is very healthy. ### i read a story about a girl who had to get her legs amputated bc she couldn‚Äôt stop picking at the skin

ti8l7v,"Just wanted to make a list of some of the horrific, unglamorous things that I went through during my severe hygienic OCD in 2019, and tell you guys that despite what you may have heard from others, OCD is positively AWFUL. Spoiler for possibility of triggering anyone. For some context, I developed an OCD against my brother in early 2019, and was unable to touch him, or anything he had touched. Quite interesting as we lived in the same house and our family was very close at the time.

\- I couldn't wear any clothes as I found them ""dirty"", so after showers where I was ""clean"" I would walk around the house completely naked until I found antibacterial wipes that I could clean the clothing with. I had no sense of decency.

\- I couldn't touch any doorknobs as my brother had touched them, so I used my feet. Then, I wiped my feet down with antibacterial wipes excessively, and wouldn't touch any of the floor where I had walked before wiping them down.

\- Because of this issue with my feet now, I wouldn't touch the floor. Which is pretty difficult because of gravity. I had to tiptoe everywhere and wipe my feet down after I went anywhere.

\- I started to find my own bed dirty, and I couldn't sleep on the floor as it was ""dirty"", so I had to sleep on a designated chair in my room. It was really uncomfortable and as a result of this I went an entire year without much sleep.

\- Food became disgusting to me, as it had been cooked by my parents, who had touched or hugged my brother/not followed my extremely restricting rules. I couldn't cook for myself, as I would have to touch ingredients that had possibly come into contact with my brother. I was practically starving, until I persuaded my parents to order pizza for me, so I survived off the Cheesy Garlic Domino's Large pizza for over a month, every night. I didn't eat breakfast, and lunch was Guzman Y Gomez fries. Sounds amazing, having takeout all the time, but it got exhausting and my body was lacking the nutrition it really needed to function properly.

\- I wasn't the only one affected by the OCD - my family were too, and my brother developed extreme anxiety and depression as a result of this. He was only eight years old. My parents also didn't handle this well - they would often purposefully go against the rules of my OCD and do things to me that are considered disgusting by regular people, like my mum licking my phone to make me cry more and my brother forcibly touching my arm. I can understand their reaction now, but it was so horrific at the time.

\- I lost interest in all hobbies. Piano - nope, it was ""dirty"" as I had previously used it after touching my brother or not following the rules I had created for myself. Drawing - nope, all of my art materials were dirty. Netball - no, I couldn't even get dressed into my uniform and I was - tw - cvtting myself regularly so it could be seen by all parents watching.

\- Obviously, I was sent to a mental hospital due to all this (the worst experience of my life), and when I left I did (with a lot of hard work) beat my OCD at the end of August 2019. However, I still feel the tendencies today to revert back to my old rules and regulations, and when my brother does something disgusting (because, lets face it, brothers can be truly disgusting sometimes) I feel the same disgust I did back in 2019. I don't think people talk enough about the horror that one feels when they recognise that old feeling.

\- COVID-19. When COVID started in 2020 (and my OCD happened in 2019) people started freaking out hygienically, in the same way I did when I had my OCD, and this was extremely confusing for me. Real-world events can trigger OCD and worsen it, and this also isn't spoken of enough, in my opinion.

\- Not horrific, but I just wanted to mention **THAT** feeling. You guys know the one. When you've somehow managed to follow all of your rules, and you feel overwhelming happiness, euphoria, reassurance and relief. It feels so amazing that sometimes I wish I could go back to my OCD behaviours just for that feeling.

\- Seeking reassurance, to the point where it becomes extremely annoying and people start hating you for it. ""Is this clean?"" ""Am I correct?"" ""Are you sure?"" People with an OCD like I had will constantly seek reassurance that their behaviours are normal, and if someone says they aren't, they won't accept it. At least, this is what happened to me.

This has been a long enough post. But I hope you readers understand that OCD is difficult and horrific. In no way is it the ""easiest mental illness"" as I have heard people say. It was the hardest thing I've ever been through, worse than depression and anxiety and domestic trauma and even self h@rm, and I encourage all of you on this sub to seek help and attempt to beat your impulses.

Your post is encouraging me to beat whatever I'm dealing with right now. If you don't mind me asking, how did you come to recognize how irrational your behaviors were? Unfortunately, I don't always recognize (or agree) that my obsessions and compulsions are excessive or unreasonable, even though I have complained about how my compulsions are time- and energy-consuming.

However if you know of any subs I could post this to please let me know!! :) <3 ### I've never posted on this community before, and I'm so happy that you guys have a wonderful automod like r/MadeOfStyrofoam :) ### I found it difficult to recognise that I was in the wrong, as I always saw my behaviours as rational, but after being put into a mental hospital and going through intense exposure therapy that I was forced into (it was against my will, but I'm still grateful for it as without it I doubt I would have recovered) I guess I realised that normal people don't have to have this happen to them. And having people outside of my family seeing what was happening to me also helped; I had thought my family was trying to make me ""disgusting"" but as I realised that other people weren't following my weird rules, I was able to recognise that what I was doing wasn't normal.

If you can afford it and if your parents support it, I really recommend some form of exposure therapy accompanied by a therapist who you don't already know. It was tricky at first (I lied a lot to the therapist by calling things that were ""clean"" to me ""disgusting"" to get out of touching things I didn't want to touch) but with time and patience and the support of your therapist, you will get there :) if I could somehow do it, you can too <3 ### No, I haven't.

If I take out the trash I have to wash 60 times. For some reason, 60 is the magic number and then I am clean. If some of the water sprinkles onto my arms while I am washing, I also have to wash my arms 60 times. Cleaning the bathroom is a nightmare for me because I have to wash 60 times in between each step so I can end up washing as much as over 350 times. I spend a fortune of money on soap and my hands hurt. Same situation with touching my car keys, door handles etc.. If I am outside I have to wash my hands 60 times before I will undress and then put my clothes in the washer. I see a lot of things as contaminated even in my own home and the other day it took me three hours to get out of the house to go grocery shopping because 1 1/2 hours of it just hand washing. Help please...",3,2022-03-20 00:29:46-04:00,"Well i used to wash my hands for about 20' at some point.
Then i went to work to a cafeteria and couldnt wash so excessively there so i got desensitised.
Now i wash them a lot but no more than 3-5 minutes.
At some point we need to force ourselves to stop doing it and that we are going to be ok. ### I used to struggle with this so much when I was 6 years old that I had I peeled big chunks of skin off of the backs of my hands.

Hand washing is a really common obsession. I‚Äôve been there, and it‚Äôs awful. No matter how much soap, how much water, how much scrubbing, your hands or any surface just doesn‚Äôt *feel* clean.

Here are some strategies to try:
1. Use liquid soap and limit yourself to 1 pump. Take time to spread it evenly over your hands so that it‚Äôs easy to feel like your entire hands were washed.
2. Watch [this video of what soap does to bacteria.](https://youtu.be/pyqhg_Efw0w) It always helps me to keep in mind that a tiny bit of soap goes a long way, and being able to visualize ‚Äúfilth‚Äù that I can‚Äôt see really helps. Soap really is incredibly good at destroying bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens. I just try to imagine a microscope slide like this while a wash my hands, and it makes it easier to get away from the sink.
3. [Here is a video of the most scientifically proven way to clean your hands in any scenario.](https://youtu.be/3PmVJQUCm4E) It really helps to know that this is the most effective way to wash hands. If it‚Äôs good enough for scientists and surgeons, and makes me feel better if I‚Äôm washing my hands.
4. Try to identify what‚Äôs really worth washing your hands over. Door knobs in your house? Not worth washing. Shopping cart handles? Yes, those are dirty and most people wash their hands after touching them. Try to write out a list and challenge yourself to identify objectively dirty from objectively clean. It is difficult to do though, so don‚Äôt be hard on yourself.
5. Challenge yourself to get your hands dirty. One of the strategies that worked for me was getting comfortable with having unclean hands. I started to struggle again a lot with hand washing a few years ago, but I decided to get a job at one of the most unclean places I can think of; a Value Village. The first week or so was hellish, I was showering for an hour at a time each time I came home from work. Over time though, I was able to reason with myself with what to clean and when. Showering after work is normal, but not for two or three hours at a time. Instead, I worked my way down to showering for only 10 minutes at most. Same goes for hand washing. Instead of washing my hands every 20 minutes at work, I managed to get used to only washing them when absolutely needed, or when I was going to eat or use the restroom. Challenging your obsessions can help.

Make sure and use lotion or aloe vera on your hands to keep them hydrated. The biggest risk to excessive hand washing is drying out your skin, and moisturizing will keep you from really hurting your hands.

It helps to talk to a therapist or psychiatrist. They can help you find strategies to avoid excessive hand washing. For some people, medication does work to limit obsessions.

As for number related obsessions, that‚Äôs a lot more broad. For me, pair or even numbers were always what I went after instead of absolutes. This depends a lot more on the person, and I‚Äôd recommend talking to your doctor about it. In the mean time, try to work with your number instead of against it. For example, instead of washing 60 times, wash your hands for 60 seconds.

I hope that this helps! ### Thank you so much for this information, it is helpful. I don't know why I am stuck on the number 60. That number does not apply to anything else in my life, only the handwashing. As you can tell I am OCD but the handwashing situation is destroying my life. ### ",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tid5uj/struggling_with_beyond_excessive_handwashing_it/

Spring of 2017 I was put on medication that has worked wonders for me. Every so often I still think ""have I just been faking it this whole time? Surely I'm making it all up for attention. It no longer impedes my daily life to the same level it used to, so surely it never did."" And of course there's the classic ""this must mean that I don't need the meds, I've never needed the meds."" Which I logically know is not true, but since when has ocd cared about logic? ### The funny part is at some point you will consider that you are faking again. Which brings the biggest point, to stop trying to figure any of these things out. That is the compulsion that fuels OCD. ### You are not faking, that s for fuckin sure! Great to hear your meds are working! Keep evolving despite of medication thought!

tibh2y,"Anyone else told they don‚Äôt seem like the ‚Äútype‚Äù to have OCD? I recently told my friend about my OCD diagnosis and his response was ‚Äúreally? You don‚Äôt seem like the type to have ocd.‚Äù While I think he didn‚Äôt mean it maliciously, my heart sank because not only is it felt invalidating to myself but also others that may experience OCD.

Has anyone else run into this preconception of what OCD looks like and how it manifests?

Background: I was diagnosed with OCD December 2021 by my therapist. I‚Äôm a private person in general, so I only told my bf and close family at that time.",5,2022-03-19 22:48:15-04:00,"Yeah, there‚Äôs a few ways to look at this.

I think it‚Äôs commonly assumed that only stupid people would ‚Äòbelieve‚Äô OCD when actually it‚Äôs usually quite intelligent people, in my experience. Just Google it, there are loads of famous examples!

In this case though, maybe your friend thinks all people with OCD are into over-zealously washing their hands and turning off light switches, and you don‚Äôt seem to him like you‚Äôd do that. 

Or maybe he‚Äôs one of those people who thinks if you seem like you‚Äôve got it together, it doesn‚Äôt make sense that you‚Äôd have a mental health issue. ### I understand how it must've felt. I told a friend of mine a little about my OCD, and she was very nice about it, but a few days later when I went over to her house to work on a project, during a conversation about handwriting, she casually went ""yeah I can't bear my handwriting to be bad, its also kinda because of my OCD  you know"". After knowing how much I suffer every single day, I thought she'd understand, but I had to calm myself down. OCD isn't really talked about, and thus we can't really blame people for not knowing about it, cuz even though I've been suffering all my life, I was one of the ""omg I'm so OCD"" people until last year. So if people with OCD don't even know what it is, I don't expect others to either, no matter how annoying it is.

Hopefully your friend meant he hasn't really ever seen you have issues around him, and thus didn't expect it. Either way, I totally understand how it would've felt. ### Yep, all the time. Even had a teacher point me out in class to say that I'm ""not the type to have OCD."" From my experience, it stems from the ""OCD is all about neatness and cleanliness"" stereotype. ### I generally don't tell people I have OCD.  I'm certain I wouldn't ""seem"" like the ""type."" my desk at work is not perfectly tidy but I know where everything is and it is organized.  I'm pretty sure I ""seem"" like I have my ish together.  I have only told my very closest friends and only told my mother within the last year even though I was diagnosed 15 years ago.  I think it presents very differently in different people and outsiders only think of the movie version of OCD.  Granted, I'm fairly certain I am not as severely affected as some people, but it has definitely made me struggle with happiness, security, anxiety, and on and on. ### My contamination OCD is literally the reason I‚Äôm so messy though.  OCD logic is weird and only certain things or things that were exposed to those certain things registered as dirty, but also heavily avoided cleaning because of the care I had to take to not cross-contaminate.  

Want to add, I realize it may sound like I misunderstood your reply and disagreed with you, but I‚Äôm just adding to why that stereotype makes no sense ### ",6,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tibh2y/anyone_else_told_they_dont_seem_like_the_type_to/
tie3y7,"New obsession - scared I will infect my baby with oral herpes I'm so paranoid about this that I haven't kissed my baby yet and don't allow my family members to kiss him.

I don't even think I have oral herpes (if I do it's asymptomatic), but there's a high chance I could because my husband and my high school boyfriend both get cold sores on occasion. More than half the adult population has oral herpes.

Anyway, I was upset today and crying hysterically while breastfeeding my child (I'm okay, just going through a lot) and didn't realize until later that he was getting a bit of saliva spray from me sobbing so close to him. Now I'm worried he will have to be hospitalized or worse.

However, obviously you‚Äôre aware that the specific worry about herpes has turned obsessive for you. I think you already know herpes doesn‚Äôt tend to pass from a small amount of saliva spray, but rather close physical contact like kissing. It‚Äôs scary when OCD involves a child so I understand you must be feeling really upset and stressed about it. Can you access therapy? ### For sure, but I do think it is bad to be this concerned about it. The chances of something bad happening from me kissing my child on the cheek is probably quite low. It's just an issue that most people wouldn't even consider, but I spend so much time worrying about.

I have a great therapist, thankfully.

thw7eo,"Obsessing over a horrible comment I commented over a year ago. This was a horrible thing of me to do. I feel so disgusted I can't bring myself to tell anyone about this, not even the closest person to me, but I have to confess. So in winter of 2020, I posted  a video on tiktok of this one character on his birthday about how much I love him. Somebody commented ""Fuck him"". I had already seen a lot of hate comments directed towards him, so to piss the commenter off, I responded with ""Oh I'd love to"". I feel so damn disgusted because the character is 17, even though I was 14 when I wrote that comment. I feel like a pedophile. I sexualized a character who is a minor. Just typing this whole thing makes me wanna cry. I'm a horrible person and I should've known better. I haven't said nor thought about anything like that about any other teen character but I still feel like a pedo...and I have always hated the adults who sexualized anime teens, but how am I any better?? Don't think anyone else saw that comment, which makes me feel even more guilty. I feel like I should confess to everyone and tell them what a disgusting thing I did. Why did I fuck up my life at 14. Is it even possible to change from this? Am I done for? I feel like dying. Do I still deserve to live?",33,2022-03-19 10:21:19-04:00,"Are you seeing a therapist OP? 
Obsession over past deeds is a facet of OCD that can be very difficult to deal with. Therapy can be so helpful.  

I'm in my 50s and still have anxiety over things said and done 20 years ago.  The thing is- I am literally the only one who cares, or remembers those things. ### I know pointing out the logical flaws usually does nothing for other OCD sufferers, but a pedophile is an adult who is attracted to children. Even if your reply abt the character was serious, it's not pedophelic for a 14 yr old (child) to find another child only 3 years apart, who is OLDER mind you, hot. That's not how pedophelia works. Teens have sex with other teens. Are they pedophiles? No. The age of the person finding the other person hot is just as relevant to what is and isn't predatory, and if you are YOUNGER than the person you think you're preying on, that's literally impossible. ### I want to avoid reassurance as much as I can because I know that‚Äôs not going to help you in the future, even if it feels good to get reassurance in the moment.

But yes, of course you deserve to live. You have OCD and you deserve help. Is therapy available for you at all? Is there any adult in your life that you can talk to, that would be able to help you get professional help? ### You didn't hurt anyones feelings or devestate anyone. You didnt ruin anyones life.  You made a snarky comment about being attracted to a character who happens to fall just under legal age. When you yourself was a minor.   You deserve to live. Your not a pedo and your not a bad person. Be well and God bless ### My heart goes out.
In that context your reply was totally normal and acceptable.
This is the OCD and it's irrationality. The OCD seems to be effecting you greatly. Please see a therapist asap. ### Can I just say that I find it weird how society is so fixated on pedophiles/pedophilia that somehow we've convinced children that they're pedophiles because they're attracted to their peers? 

OP you didn't do anything wrong. Even if you were legitimately sexualizing this character you're a teenager who thinks another teenager is sexy. That's....completely normal. ### Well, everybody said it already, this is classic OCD.

Your comment was nothing to feel so bad about. It's not a real person, it's a character and you weren't sexualizing it, you just replied a mean comment with what you thought was an ""even"" response. 

Even if you intentionally did sexualize that character, that would be a 14 year old feeling attraction to an artistic representation of a 17 year old. Nothing wrong here at all.

And no, you shouldn't have known better at 14. It's really nice to see you care about these issues, but please, PLEASE seek help, don't let OCD take over your life, OK? ### Listen, that what you said is completely normal i would say and there is no reason whatsoever to obsess about that. Like why? You are not a pedo, you just have OCD and you have to understand that that what you commented is ok. Just chill, its just OCD, a bad one. ### I really understand you. I have OCD and my brain is also tormenting me with memories. I always find new reasons why I am a bad person and every time this reason seems fatal to me. At first I tried to fight it, justified myself, and in the end, again and again, I found new reasons for self-humiliation. Then I just realized, that it doesn't make sense! Why should I do this? Yeah, even if I am bad person, what should I do? I cannot delete all my memories and of course, nobody can change your past, but you can always help other people, correct your mistakes and enjoy life. I advise you not to run away from the memories, do not try to justify yourself, cause OCD will always find a reason for anxiety. Be yourself with all your mistakes and bad deeds and remember that obsessive thoughts are always meaningless. Be strong! Everything will be fine :) ### this is literally so stupid I‚Äôm crying ### I‚Äôm going to be blunt. That is fucking stupid to obsess over. You were literally a minor yourself when you wrote it. ### you deserve to live. this is just your ocd talking. ocd doesn‚Äôt get to say what is right and wrong!! i suggest getting ocd therapy it helped me a lot. when i get these types of obsessions i tell my ocd things like ‚Äúi can‚Äôt change what i‚Äôve done, i‚Äôm going to move on.‚Äù ‚Äúso, what‚Äù ‚Äúur dumb ocd‚Äù and things of the sort ### please no one give reassurance! it only makes ocd worse. ### [deleted] ### hey i‚Äôm not op but i was wondering, are you speaking from experience? like is this actually something that can truly improve with therapy? I have so many of these ‚Äúpast guilt‚Äù obsessions that i never considered the guilt could ever be alleviated. as such I just never bothered telling them to my therapist.. ### I was supposed to get help a long time ago but things got complicated and now I have to wait for probably a couple of more months until I get proper help. But I can't tell any adult about this because of how horrible it is. I know you said you want to avoid reassurance but I want to know what your thoughts on what I did are. ### But how is it acceptable?? I just saw a post on tiktok again where they called ppl who sexualized a 17-year-old fictional character ""red flags"". Many people have said the same thing. And I should be getting help but my parents don't believe I have any problems, but thank you for your concern. ### Well sorry it might seem dumb but I can't help but be terrified of being a bad person bc of this when others have been hated on for doing the exact same thing ### Then why do people get so mad and call others red flags and bad people when they do that? Idk it makes me feel even worse if I even try to justify what I did ### What do you mean? /gen ### YES, therapy can absolutely help. It can be helpful to learn how to break that cycle of over analyzing things that just don't matter.  
I still struggle with it a little,  but rather than guilt,  I might feel mild embarrassment.  I deal with the thought in the moment and move on with my day.

I didn't get full blown OCD until later in my life (in response to trauma) but I must have been predisposed,  as I have always over analyzed past events and dealt with the subsequent guilt and anxiety. 

Since you are already in therapy,  you have nothing to lose and everything to gain by letting your therapist know about these thoughts.  Good luck! ### I‚Äôm really sorry to hear that, I hope you can get help soon. And I‚Äôll just say this: I don‚Äôt think what you did is bad in any way, no matter what way you want to look at it, you were 14 talking about a 17 year old, that‚Äôs someone 3 years older than you. Even if 17 is a minor that doesn‚Äôt mean anything, minors being attracted to minors (especially when you‚Äôre the younger one here) is completely normal. I know it‚Äôs hard but please stop torturing yourself over this. It‚Äôs way easier said than done but start trying to let the thoughts go. It‚Äôs going to be very anxiety inducing at first but it‚Äôll be worth it in the long run as you won‚Äôt be suffering anymore. ### People say that in regards to grown ass adults sexualising a minor. It's impossible for a 14 year old to be a pedophile if they are attracted to someone OLDER than them, that doesn't make any sense. Teenagers being sexually attracted to teenagers is normal. Grown ass adults being sexually attracted to teenagers and making sexual comments? Not acceptable. If I had saw your comment I would have laughed, it seemed proportionate to the situation and 14 years olds say stupid things sometimes but there was nothing even remotely wrong with what you said teenagers have crushes on other teenagers all the time. If you said that in regards to a 10 year old that would make you a pedophile though, which is someone attracted to a PREpubescent child, someone who hasn't even hit puberty yet. Also sounds like your getting too wrapped up in Tiktok there's so much misinformation spread on there, if it's affecting your OCD so much I'm begging you to just delete the app and go for a walk instead. ### Youre literally making no sense bro that why it‚Äôs funny, go to a police officer or a therapist and tell ‚Äòem this shit and they will laugh at u, you‚Äôre okay and not a pedo at all ### They say that to actual adults fantasising over teenagers. It's not the same. You're a teenager, your fine. There's a tremendous difference. ### [deleted] ### Then why do ppl on for example twitter and tiktok start hating on ppl when they do the same thing I did? Ik tiktok and twitter has many toxic users but idk I really feel like I did something rly wrong man ### But I still sexualized a minor. It's bad even though It's a fictional character and older than me. ### From what I‚Äôve seen, these people are usually referring to adults sexualizing minors, not minors finding other minors attractive. If that were the case, wouldn‚Äôt every kid under the age of 18 who is dating another minor or finds another minor attractive be a pedo? ### Because they‚Äôre chronically online and a bunch of idiots, literally no one in real life acts that way. Besides, you wanted to fuck a character when you were 14 so what? Characters aren‚Äôt real, there‚Äôs a big line between fiction and reality, characters portray attitudes that are seen as attractive or idealistic to a certain niche, that‚Äôs why some people fall in love w them (losers) but there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that. If you start seeing patterns irl that indicate that you‚Äôre actually a pedo, that‚Äôs when you should be worried. But come on, being attracted to a character is normal. I like saiki and I am an adult, but I am in no way attracted to 16 year old boys, I only like characters like him. You see what I mean? ### [deleted] ### Did you forget what sub this is?

Why are you being such an asshole? You are in a sub about OCD and OP is looking for help, not your stupid, sarcastic comments. ### But why do other teenagers get called out for doing a similar thing? Even though the character is older, sexualizing minors is still wrong. And ik I did it over a year ago but still it doesn't change what I did ### Reddit put it on my fyp, so no I didn't know. I was trying to rationalize the irrational. And besides the first comment i don't think my responses were that bad, once I realized they were serious I tried to help. ### Both of your comments were shitty (I only saw 2). 
You were not helping a person with OCD with those comments. 

FYI,  someone with OCD knows that their thoughts aren't always rational,  yet they still struggle.  It's the worst kind of hell. ### The 2nd one came across as shitty because you had more context than I did. In a regular vent thread I'd say it was sound advice. Which I thought this was. I deleted the comments because I realize now it wasn't appropriate for the situation. Hope the OP gets the help they need.

ti5j74,"I can‚Äôt eat anymore (tw: Ed) It‚Äôs gotten so bad that I can‚Äôt really eat or cook anymore. I only eat a small amount of pre packaged snacks and drinks when I‚Äôm so hungry I can‚Äôt anymore because being in the kitchen causes me stress. I generally don‚Äôt like leaving my bedroom. 

Even grocery shopping is extremely hard. Sometimes I have to take a new cart and re-fill everything because something in my cart touched something. It takes ages and I touch things in the store that cause me to run to the bathroom to wash my hands. Sometimes I throw what I buy away as soon as I get home. 

As far as eating and cooking goes, I‚Äôm terrified the food will get in my eyes, hair, on my clothes and already have a huge list of foods I won‚Äôt eat because of that. I mostly only eat pre packaged dry food or plain toast. Nothing that is spicy or runny.

I won‚Äôt go near the kitchen sink because it‚Äôs full of triggers ( makes me drink less water then usual too), and can‚Äôt wash my dishes or get water for cooking, so I don‚Äôt cook. When I cook I can‚Äôt watch every move of mine and every time I attempt cooking something on my body gets wet or touched something it shouldn‚Äôt and I have to go shower, wash my hair and change. 

All of this has gotten so exhausting I would rather just not eat then take the challenge upon myself and risk contamination and the whole cleaning ritual that comes with it.

I sympathize with you not wanting to even perform daily functions due to the fear and I feel that way at times too.  The thing is, we have to fight even if it is all the time.  Our brains are essentially attacking us and we need to defend ourselves by doing things that reclaim our lives.  I just started therapy last week and had a really shitty day once again today, giving into compulsions, feeling super guilty and depressed and overall just exhausting myself with cleaning compulsions.  But I have resolved that no matter what I will fight this thing with every inch of my being until I die and never give up.  It will not conquer me easily at all.  I guess you could say that is my cross to bear and my purpose right now is to overcome.  If you haven't yet, I encourage you to seek therapy.  It won't get better without it and in fact will continue to deteriorate.  If you can do nothing else, seek out a therapist at all costs and get started treating this debilitating disorder. ### You should definitely see a doctor.

This isn‚Äôt uncommon for some people with OCD, but it‚Äôs quite dangerous. You need to talk to a doctor as soon as you can, they can absolutely help you get over this, and help get fluids/food into you so you‚Äôll feel better.

This happened to me when I was about 11. Got severely dehydrated and made myself sick. Had to go to the hospital and felt a million times better when I finally got some food and water into my system. They gave me an intravenous some soup to start, it was easier to get down, and it really made tackling the OCD so much easier.

You can beat this! Doctors can and will help.

Take care and please be safe! ### If you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please do not hesitate to talk to someone. The wonderful u/froidinslip has

ti74bt,"Amazing achievement. We all deserve happy days. Spreading some positive vibes. I've been having a problem about my creative projects for a long time now where I'm worried that I'll draw/create something accidentally 'evil' that harms people. Well, I forced myself to share some of my work on Saturday with my family and they said it was good.

I had a bit of a wobble after/because of that, and started to spiral, but I went back to my workbook and did my ERP exercises, and I successfully got myself out of the spiral within 24 hours, without a) giving in all the way to compulsions (I tried doing them but they didn't feel like they were helping anymore so I tried to cope without them instead and I WAS OK!!?!) or b) giving in to a secondary self-harmful thing like binge eating, self-harm, etc. I did spend a bit of money uncarefully, but even then I was less reckless than I usually am when I'm freaking out. And all of this is happening while I've been in a hypomanic episode with my bipolar, which makes my OCD generally worse.

I still feel kind of wobbly, but I feel strong enough to at least know I'm not going to hurt myself, and that's... really cool. A kind of confident feeling. I'm not my own enemy at least today. It makes me feel like there is hope after so many struggles.

I just want to share it so anyone reading this knows it's possible! You can have good days. **You deserve good days.** You deserve to feel proud about your good days, but also about the episodes you start having that you have to fight through, because fighting OCD is a full time job a lot of the time. You're stronger than you know - we all are. And we all deserve happy days. :)",2,2022-03-19 18:54:23-04:00,"Congratulations! Proud that you battled through, that's a great achievement!

I can't go against him anymore, I can't stop my brain. OCD guessing things right that, even i never can guess that things. I'm starting to think he has a soul. Maybe it is something paranormal. ƒ∞ hope it is, because it would be easy to get rid of. Maybe this being just teasing with me. I hope so.

Low key I keep having an intrusive thought were I think that someone else is with me in my room but I recognize it as irrational i don‚Äôt believe it at all I got full insight but my intrusive thoughts get so irrational it‚Äôs so overwhelming trying to combat them ### Maybe your OCD is just too strong? I can't describe it well, but when I start to give way to these thoughts, they become stronger, and the compulsions are uncontrollable. And when it becomes unbearably hard to live with it, I just tell myself ""stop"" and try to stop this as fast as possible, like no ""one more time"" or something like this. The first time is difficult, but every hour it gets easier and easier for you. I even got rid of OCD for a while on my own, but never completely succeeded. Of course, you need therapist and meds for the treatment of OCD, but there can be some ways to make your life easier. Do you understand what I am talking about? ### This is probably a lot of anxiety and ocd playing with me but I need advice I‚Äôm scared , so last week I felt strange me and my boyfriend had a Chinese takeaway he made himself sick so every time I‚Äôd eat I‚Äôd have anxiety that omg what if I‚Äôm gonna make myself sick and have an eating disorder I was already anxious last week then I was talking to someone about the situation with my boyfriend been with him 6 months I‚Äôm not deeply attracted to him I don‚Äôt love him or have crazy feelings for him but I love how we are together I love him for who he is he treats me well I love what we have i don‚Äôt wanna be with anyone else I don‚Äôt want him to either but iv been crying pretty much everyday hardly can eat or sleep constantly getting anxiety because I feel that okay then if I had friends and a social life would I care about him but when I wanted to be friends with these girls I still wanted to be with him anyway before all this I was fine so was he I‚Äôd never hurt him but it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm getting anxiety is it fair staying with him bla bla when before all this I was fine iv told him everything we both wanna stay together but can u grow to love someone who your not deeply attracted too he‚Äôs not ugly he‚Äôs not my type but he‚Äôs cute I love how we are with r sex situation I lost my virginity to him in Oct 2021 and it just feels like somethings going in and out of me the only time I get pleasure is when I watch porn and rub my clit I always used to wanna have sex with him but I hardly do it as I don‚Äôt feel no pleasure I care about him I like him a lot obviously since iv been like this everything with us feels strange like iv lost feelings for him that‚Äôs obviously because my anxiety has been high but when everything calms down things will grow am I lying to myself am I a bad person I want things to go back to how they was with us last week I was anxious anyway so it took something to trigger ocd and get me all worked up I‚Äôm trying not to cry and after this I‚Äôm not talking to anyone about it cuz it‚Äôs feeding the anxiety if I can be okay today as I was yesterday then maybe this time next week I‚Äôll be fine I just don‚Äôt wanna cry for anyone who‚Äôs had intrusive thoughts ocd or whatever you‚Äôll understand what I‚Äôm talking about when u can eat or sleep constantly crying u feel like ur going insane it doesn‚Äôt matter what anyone says really it‚Äôs the same thing going on in my head ### Yes, I have had this illness since childhood. I don't think there is anyone with me, I just used it as an analogy. I only have such ideas. For example, a thought comes to my mind if this person texts me right now, it means x, my intrusive thought will happen. or if this word is used in 1 minute on television right now it means x will happen. Most of the time they happens. Like in 5    minutes after i thought that if my friend texts me, she really texts me. Or  television thing, i heard that word in one minute. Then im going crazy. These are just basic examples. There has crazy ones too. Like it only can happen once in a year and i predicts that true. Then i think maybe OCD is something invisible with me. Like supernatural and pop that thoughts into my mind. Btw sorry for english:) ### Yeah i understand what u mean. Im really ok with any type of ocd but these coincidence thing ruins everything.

ti6se6,"Panic OCD, SEVERE, CRIPPLING, and life ruining after my first panic attack please help For starters I've suffered from OCD my entire life, things such as having to touch things with both hands in the same spot, counting, making sure the volume is on even numbers, hair pulling, etc, etc

I've never had the physical side effects of anxiety though (from what I understand ocd is classified as an anxiety disorder).

Two months ago I had my first ever panic attack after smoking too much weed and my life has been hell ever since, it was the first time I've experienced ""panic"" such as the burning in the chest, the sinking feeling in the stomach, the FEAR that something is wrong.  The problem is that ever since that panic attack started, I've been stuck in a state of panic and my brain is doing it obsessively, constantly using the panic neural pathway in the brain (this is what I figured and how my psychiatrist explained it also).

So I've basically been stuck in a never ending panic attack for two months and it has ruined my physical and mental health, I have a rush of adrenaline and sinking feeling in my stomach every 15 seconds for NO reason at all, my brain is just very obsessive an it keeps activating the panic button.  I can't control it either, it won't stop no matter what I do.  My mouth is always dry and I feel on edge and over stimulated 24/7.  My joints hurt all the time and the worst thing is my ability to heal has been drastically shut down, my joints and muscles don't heal from wear and tear anymore so I've been bed ridden.

I've tried SSRIs, benzos, antipsychotics, etc, and NOTHING has helped at all, some things may help me cope and deal with it better but nothing stops my brain from constantly panicking.  I've been looking into assisted suicide as I can't imagine the rest of my life being in a permanent panic attack, this is no way to live.

Anyways, I need to know if anyone has dealt with something similar and if there's any way for me to get out of constant fight or flight, thank you.

TLDR; my brain learned how to panic and it's obsessively hitting the panic button for no reason.  ",21,2022-03-19 18:38:00-04:00,"So covid made me a wreck like this. It was insane. I downloaded an app called unwinding anxiety by jud brewer. At the time the app was free for 30 days and so I had nothing to lose. I gave it a try. It worked a ton and now I‚Äôm taking Buspirone and it‚Äôs helping me also. I‚Äôm only a few weeks in but I can already tell a difference. I also take clonazepam every night at bedtime because I am scared I‚Äôm going to go to sleep and not wake up (my brother died if covid this way and wasn‚Äôt even that bad). Between these three thing plus weekly therapy I‚Äôm finally feeling some relief. They each individually helped but I need them all. Please don‚Äôt end your life.

You just have to find what works. For me I find talking to my panic and Ocd as if it were a monster. It has a face and in my mind I talk to it. And when those feelings come I specifically tell it I‚Äôm not worried about you. I literally will become curious and try to pinpoint exactly what it is that I‚Äôm feeling, where am I feeling it, on what side of my body am I feeling it more, do I feel it more in this body part or that body part, and I also try to focus on my feet NOT my breath. The feet do not hold anxiety and therefore you can ground yourself by focusing on your feet what do you feel, do you feel more pressure on your right foot or your left foot, do you feel each individual toe, can you feel the top of your feet, the bottom of your feet,are they warm, are they cold etc. there are several techniques that this app teaches you and it is worth every penny. Also find a way to make others happy. It gives meaning and value to living. I crochet for the homeless. It brings me joy and a reason to live by helping others less fortunate. Please keep me posted.

Sending love & healing. You are stronger than you know. ### My OCD symptoms starting showing up after my first big panic attack at 14. I completely understand how you feel. After that, I was a nervous wreck. Didn‚Äôt want to leave my house, got an illness I was unable to heal from, missed out on quite a bit of school, etc. That started a snowball of events, and now less than two years later I‚Äôve gained five diagnoses and counting. It‚Äôs a rough journey and is hard to recover from. I‚Äôm very grateful to be in a loving household and have access to NDIS (disability funding) because of the country I live in. I still struggle every day but it‚Äôs getting easier.

I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. ### Thank you so much for the comment and support it genuinely means a lot, I've been reading about my experience with my ""panic attack"" from weed and my symptoms and I've read other people experiencing a similar situation from covid where they get stuck in fight or flight like so it's helpful to read your experience as well but I'm also sorry you're dealing with this hell.  I guess when something bad happens we go into fight or flight and our brains think we're still in danger?  It's so fucked up like a mix of subconscious OCD and PTSD.

I'm sorry about your brother and I've had sleep issues since this has occurred as well, I'm using an antihistamine + gabapentin just to get to sleep, I genuinely can't fall asleep without medication anymore it's hell.

>I downloaded an app called unwinding anxiety by jud brewer. At the time the app was free for 30 days and so I had nothing to lose. I gave it a try. It worked a ton

I'll try this, I believe in the power of the mind since I'm no doubt creating all of my own symptoms.  It's just scary that I can't seem to control it at will, there was a stretch of about \~20 minutes when I was talking to my friends and laughing having a good time about two weeks ago where my symptoms were alleviated by at least half so I think I need to do things that make me feel safe and happy but it's really difficult to do that when you're stuck in fight or flight.

Also for your other comment, I haven't tried Buspirone but I'll ask my psychiatrist, rn I'm trying out a different SSRI to see if it works but idk if they're really affecting me at all (it might as well be a sugar pill).

The benzo I used for a week helped quite a bit to help me ignore my symptoms but I'm scared of dependence and addiction so I stopped.  I also stopped it since even though it was helping it didn't fully get me out of fight or flight, it just made the adrenaline rushes less severe if that makes sense.

I'm just scared because not only of the constant fight or flight but because I've developed severe depression and anhedonia as well, I can't seem to enjoy anything anymore (I MEAN it's hard to enjoy anything when stuck in fight or flight but it's been getting worse for me since this all started). ### If you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please do not hesitate to talk to someone.

I‚Äôm saving this. Very helpful little bot you are. ### I understand all this and can relate. You aren‚Äôt alone in feeling this way. It‚Äôs hard to be happy when you feel terrified all the time. 

Buspirone isn‚Äôt addictive that‚Äôs a great thing too. You can stop without withdrawals too which is great. But my doctor felt it was important for me to be on a the clonazepam and I trust my doctor. It is scary but I was able to take prescription sleeping pills and stop them so he feels I could stop this too. But everyone develops addiction differently so you could be different. I was just at a point I couldn‚Äôt survive without help. I hope I can get off them someday but I‚Äôm in no hurry. I think this will take me some time to overcome maybe even a couple years. So you need to work with your doctor and determine what meds are worth what risks. Because the way I see it, if you aren‚Äôt alive long enough to worry about being addicted it‚Äôs a moot point anyway. So the goal is to stay alive then deal with weaning off the meds later. I‚Äôve weaned off clonazepam one time before when things were bad so I am confident in my ability to do so but I also know not everyone can. I‚Äôm just saying when you are struggling at the point you are you need to be sure you don‚Äôt get to the point of giving up before you exhaust all measures. One more point is weed or other drugs like alcohol etc can also be addictive. I feel more comfortable taking a prescription I know how I deal with reliably and consistently versus not knowing what the street drugs have in them. Now medical marijuana is a different story but can still be addictive even thought it is consistently batched and harvested. So just wanted to throw that out there that the risk of addiction is there for both weed and antihistamines. But you also have to do what keeps you alive and I get that too. I take Benadryl nightly with my clon. I am sure my body is addicted to both. But I‚Äôm also aware this is keeping me alive right now. 

Ok long explanation just to say don‚Äôt rule out something that takes the edge off. But definitely find something that works best for you whatever that may be. I think nothing in itself is a magic bullet. I think it takes a combo to fight this disease. You have to come after that monster from all sides or he‚Äôll attack from an angle you didn‚Äôt have protected. Meds is just one tool. Try all the tools available to you. 

One more thing. Reddit is therapy for me. I like to help people. I don‚Äôt know you but I genuinely need you to stay alive. I can‚Äôt explain it. It make me want to stay alive so I can try to help others stay alive. I seek out hurting people and give them some love and advise because it keeps me alive. It gives me worth. It heals me a little every time I can help someone else heal a little. Your life is saving my life. You reaching out reminds me of the hardest times in my life and how someone helped me. Some stranger on Reddit. They talked me out of it. I give that back to others because I remember what it felt like. I‚Äôll never know their name but they saved my life. Don‚Äôt even know what country they live in lol. But I mattered to them. Just like you matter to me. So please just keep fighting. Subscribe to happy subs like aww, puns, jokes, what‚Äôs wrong with your cat, and the list goes on‚Ä¶these keep positive things in your feed. Unsubscribe to negativity that enters your feed. Find a way to laugh and smile at least once a day. It just feels good. And please‚Ä¶just keep trying. And please keep me posted. I genuinely do care. I please know someone under the same starts will be saying a prayer for you tonight before bed (sorry if that offends you I don‚Äôt mean for it to. I have no desire to change your mind about god. I just want you to know I care enough to pray for a stranger I‚Äôll never know.) üíï ### To your response as well‚Ä¶yes meds only take the edge off for me. It just helps it doesn‚Äôt stop it. It helps me to stop it myself though. ### One more thing‚Ä¶I‚Äôm not ‚Äúweed shaming‚Äù you. I am sorry if it came off that way. I‚Äôm just saying everything has a risk and dependence possibility. I genuinely don‚Äôt care if you smoke weed. I‚Äôm just using that as an example to do what works for you. ### Thank you for this, I'll keep this thread updated. ### No I'm never smoking weed again, since smoking too much was what caused the issues in the first place, never again. ### I‚Äôll be thinking about you until then. ### I get that.

Then to fixing my iPod Touch between certain lines on a table cloth.

Then to worrying about the cleanliness of my PS3.

Before it really got bad, I had social anxiety and depression, though I suspect these three intermingle and interact.

I was usually happy, though extremely sensitive, and experienced heights and also very mixed sentiments (once I was laughing and crying tears of anger/sadness at the same time).

I was and am very intelligent, with an unusually early reading maturity, though I never cared for ""developing myself"" consistently, was never pushed by anyone, and would read dog breed books along with the classics and philosophy. I also did whatever I pleased. I never cared about school or grades (actually my ACT, taken in the OCD cycle, though I will take it again due to the COVID transfer college season, was a 35 and 36 for English and Reading respectively, and a 21 and 25 for Math and Science respectively. When I got interested in mathematics and computer science, and their connection to philosophy, and on their own, I jumped to those subjects; now I'm a computer science and philosophy double major). In fact, if I recall correctly, how I started reading Homer at eleven was when I missed the date for choosing a book for an assignment, was given a generic book by the teacher, got upset, and chose it anyway. However, I never read a lot either. I should have read more (something I do now in all areas really, though I have some biases just given by duration).

Around eighth grade and ninth, I realized my social troubles were due to my intelligence. As a result, I became a clown. Then when this phase went away, I was stuck in the middle of a desert (already in the OCD cycle). I didn't know what to do. There was a lot of internal setting measure updates. I'm still doing this.

It's hard, though I don't really have any nostalgia. What I have thought is this: I should consolidate myself by taking the elements of my past, and rearranging those units into the present and future. Also, don't let new or seemingly entirely new things detract me from taking them on full speed. Aside from this, there are things that are always there, or which come about (like the falling of baby teeth and the growing in of adult teeth).

I was never social. I only realized just how alone me and my parents naturally are. It's inherited. Though I wish I could have taken advantage of this bonus (I am now). Though I dislike psychometric testing, for reference, I usually score between zero and five on extraversion, above around eighty on conscientiousness, over 95 on openness, and between one and five on agreeableness. I have seen one who scored a zero on openness, but it seems very rare.

I do recall in elementary school that every year I would resolve to be more talkative, and would eventually fail. All my friends (there are really two real one's right now) I have known for years (since 2nd grade for one; another since 6th). We are still close, though we go to college in different areas of the US. We can go for a long time without talking, but once we meet, it's just like yesterday.

I was insecure, truth be told, of my introverted tendency. I think my parents are too (though they are still in denial of their own selves I believe, to an extent, and hence thought or wished themselves to be otherwise. Unfortunately, that is not how sociology works). Now I just take it, though I think to single out traits to be proud of is silly.

I was also very confident, sure of myself, most of the time, sometimes very arrogant, and very straight, and without tact.

At certain points I've tried to change instead of augmenting myself. Bad idea. Human nature is like a wave: sure, it will reach some distance of beach, but it will always go back to the source.

As I said, past patterns are good, but it's good to be open to the new or the seemingly entirely new (I say seeming because some part of their arising it seems is already there, a part of nature).

Sorry for the long post. Hope it helps. ### CW; little bit of a vent but completely related to the question - My anxiety only started at 13. My OCD began to show itself at 14. I‚Äôm turning 16 this year and it feels like I‚Äôve gone through hell in such a short time frame. I‚Äôve picked up multiple diagnoses since then, and everything just blurs together and overlaps now. But I very clearly remember my world before. Life of the party, always on stage. Confident in myself. Straight A‚Äôs in school. Happy and free spirited, with joy still in my heart. It‚Äôs gone now. I‚Äôm a shell of what I used to be, but I‚Äôm learning to accept it. I‚Äôve become a new person and I suppose that‚Äôs okay.

I definitely am not trying to do that here.

Ever since I can remember I‚Äôve had these never ending guilty thoughts about being a bad person. Almost every day in kindergarten and first grade I‚Äôd have to go to the nurse‚Äôs office because I‚Äôd feel so anxious my stomach would hurt or I‚Äôd pee my pants. Then at night I‚Äôd go wake my mom up, crying, and ask her ‚Äúwould you still love me if I ____‚Äù or ‚Äúam I a bad person‚Äù. In middle school I developed an eating disorder that I had throughout high school. I also went through a stage where I was pulling my eyelashes out because I said they hurt. My parents took me to my pediatrician for it and she said it was in my head, but I still pull my eyebrow hairs out when I‚Äôm stressed.


I‚Äôm currently working as a barista, and I‚Äôm very messy when I make drinks (because of my ADHD). However, my coworkers all know I am very freaked out by things touching my drinks that I make for myself. Like I wrap the straw in a paper towel-or put a cup on top of it- because I‚Äôm afraid of anything touching it. I also had a panic attack last week because a customer had a cut on his hand when he handed me money. I spent like 15 minutes in the back washing my hands in scalding hot water.

I definitely have anxiety, depression, and ADHD. My question is, is it possible for ADHD to mask/counteract symptoms of OCD? I can be forgetful and messy, but I have all these other behaviors that I don‚Äôt understand. I don‚Äôt know how to get rid of them and I thought maybe if I knew what they were from it would help.

thyvm6,"Living with OCD for as long as I can remember‚Ä¶ Hello to anyone reading this, I‚Äôve been struggling with OCD for more than half the time I‚Äôm alive. It waxes and wanes over the years but has proven to be immensely persistent and debilitating in many aspects of my life, be it socially, physically, mentally or professionally.

Mental illness has always felt pretty taboo to me where I‚Äôm from and I‚Äôve only very recently decided to seek help from my school‚Äôs mental health professionals. I recall bursting into tears when describing the first instance of my friends taking notice of my behaviour to my counsellor because I felt so intensely vulnerable. Before then, I only (and rather briefly) told my family I was certain I had OCD. The rest of my life I lived perfecting the art of acting like a perfectly normal human where everything was fine and dandy. 

These therapy sessions helped but then I graduated and stopped them altogether and a year later I find myself pretty much regressed to where I was before seeking help. In fact, I would say that my OCD has found multiple new peaks the last couple months because of the isolating nature of working from home as a result of the pandemic.

I‚Äôm writing this not to lament how miserable my life is, but to take a huge step (at least to me) to proving to myself its okay to be seen and heard because thus far, the number of people aware of my OCD can be counted with my hands.",5,2022-03-19 12:28:32-04:00,"Heyyo, thank you for having the courage to post this.  I've also had ocd for the bulk of my life. 25 currently.

I have also been expending much mental resources to appear outwardly as a normal person. But I think medication really helped in combating the anxiety that comes with ocd and made life easier. 

Mental illness is a taboo here too so hardly nobody around me know about my condition, except my parents. But I would still encourage you to seek help - perhaps at a private clinic.. if you can afford it...

I'm not sure how it is like at your country. For me, I went to a govt clinic which was more affordable.. and regretted it because I realised afterwards that the  health records are tracked in the govt system makes it harder to get hired for govt jobs. 


Please get help! It really makes life easier.. esp the meds ### Hey coincidentally i‚Äôm also 25, going 26 this year. Thank you for your kind words and advice, it means a great deal.

Like you I was very much afraid that seeking treatment would leave a ‚Äòstain‚Äô in my records which would affect my job opportunities. In fact, I only got help after the school health centre confirmed anonymity for those seeking help.

Back then the school psychiatrist did prescribe medication for me, albeit a very low dosage. He told me to take half a tablet of fluoxetine, as my OCD symptoms were apparently relatively mild. Considering he spent approximately 20 minutes diagnosing my OCD, i didn‚Äôt think his assessment on the severity of my OCD was entirely accurate‚Ä¶

The prescription didn‚Äôt do much for me, even after bringing it to 1 tablet. I quickly moved on to ERP with the school therapists and for the first time in my life, I felt my symptoms alleviate significantly with the weekly sessions. It‚Äôs a real pity these sessions ended.

Upon graduation, I was advised to get diagnosed by the government clinics but have so far stopped short for fear of creating a permanent record. I recently started in my full time job and the stigma unfortunately weighs on me.

Alas, I‚Äôm very glad that the medication has made things easier for you! I will definitely consider seeking help again. ### Hello again!

I joined private /commercial sector and kept the ocd a secret from my employers. It was the right move.. sadly the stigma is still there. Even colleagues who had burnt out or meltdown are sometimes judged  negatively ... so.. oh wells. 

I think you could look for private therapists/ doctors. 
Or possible to find out if any of the therapists you have seen previously practice in private or have since moved to private practice? 

(Agreed that Half a tablet of fluoxetine is quite low.. I took multiple tablets fluoxetine as a kid.. then switched to sertraline because fluoxetine caused me drowsiness as a side effect (idk why) and I slept in class..)

 I think it's likely that the presccription didn't do much for you because (a) not the right dosage or (b) you have not found the med that suits you the most..I was lucky to have found a great psychiatrist who was exercised wise judgement and helped me find the right dose and medication...  you can consider starting to look for one too! ### Hello! I also joined the private sector and like you chose to keep OCD a secret when filling the pre-employment forms. This meant continuing the pretence that all was fine, hard because some days I‚Äôm a crumbling mess within.

I‚Äôll consider private therapists, but they are pretty expensive‚Ä¶ my friend pays 100s for a single session which is pretty expensive to me. The therapists I seen previously are catering more to the school so it can be hard to find a common time.

Got you on the meds! I agree, even though the dosage was later increased to 1 tablet of fluoxetine, unfortunately I did not feel any appreciable difference. I will look to exploring other medicine dosage and options, and doing ERP alongside. Thank you for all the advice, it gives me a renewed sense of hope for my condition! ### No problem, all the best comrade!

ti938p,"""New beginning"" OCD I posted this as a response to a post of similar tendency, but thought I should post this separately. 

&#x200B;

Interesting that this type has appeared. This is what I ""have.""

For me, it began in 2016 or so. For around two years prior I had experienced ""just"" (really painful, as it is) depression and social anxiety.

What happened was OCD became nested within these over the ensuing years. As I type, I struggle.

Perhaps due to my fears, I became a sort of religious fanatic. I had prayed (in the typical OCD way) for years before. Yet my prayers became increasingly detrimental.

You see, the Baptist church in the US has this view of God whereby if you do a so-called ""sinner's prayer"", your so-called sins are supposed to be washed away. You will then, in a sense, begin anew. I saw this as a way out and became a fanatic.

Unfortunately, there were many problems. First of all, I couldn't ""perfectly"" pray. Like many with OCD, it is a feeling of ""just right"", but this ""just right"" is based on some criteria of thought. For myself, I kept putting forth what I term objections in the form of ""nasty"" thoughts that would lead me to believe that the prayer was not perfect. Even if I did get the prayer right, I would have heavy doubts about my memory and so have to ""restart"" again. To be precise, these were all sinner's prayers. Then the recognition of ""nasty"" thoughts became more perceptible, I more judging, and there goes hell. Aside from this, it is common for the members in Baptist churches to happily state their ""born again"" day, usually to the effect of, ""On \[enter date\], I was saved, and since then, I have been saved."" Happily ever after. Note this is common even outside of the Baptist church. You have Physics Olympiad winners having similar narratives. Boxers, wrestlers, many who have so-called conversions. Keep in mind it is that: a story, a self-constructed narrative, a trying to shape one's history, one's story.

This was initially, by perception, a response to my use of porn. Plus the sinner's prayer, along with the fears I mentioned.

Yet it only escalated. Soon my self-sabotaging phase would be for a weak, I believe sometimes even longer. I would have to set everything up, especially at a certain time and date, usually a Sunday, a day I perceived as ""holy."" Also, the digits then had to be right. No ""suggestive"" digits that might lead to omens like six, or some numeral combination of month/day/year. This only prolonged everything. All the while, I would be basically in a ""coma"", away from reality, or doing things that would be ""sinful."" I would have to take the opposite end to my supposed heaven. At times I might also go to a local canyon to do this ritual (nice story, eh), or take a screenshot of the date and time, to keep it ""memorable.""

In time it became worse, though it got a little better as I began college while taking Escitalopram. The self-sabotage time decreased, but, despite this, I would still repeat every day or every other day or so, which would just be a recalculation to the same effect.

When I transferred, the OCD got really bad. I ""resolved"" even harder to be ""perfect"", and, by the end of my last semester, had to drop a course because I was redoing the readings and problems over and over. By a certain time, one cannot catch up. This happened this semester as well, although perhaps with a secondary reason. I continued with the rituals, but the criteria was even more strict. Far more. If I got up a minute late, then restart. If I drop my phone, restart. If I have a suspicion that I did something wrong, restart. If I haven't memorized everything, restart. If I'm not acting according to some vague definition of perfection, restart. Again, I would take screenshots, I would go to the bathroom and tell myself that now this would be it. I should state that by then, I was (and am) an atheist, though labels don't make much of a difference when the same blueprint is there. Last semester as well, I developed horrible contamination fears. This centered around poop, semen, work, memory, and what I mentioned above. This has been really bad. If I don't clean the whole room (my areas, not my roommates), then I think that I will somehow have this memory forever, that I won't be able to think and perceive clearly (my intelligence will drop), I'll become deranged, that I will think of myself as evil and deranged, that I will fall apart mentally, that I will recall in ten/twenty/forty years that I made a fateful decision, et cetera. There are false causalities everywhere. I also became fearful of my intelligence, thinking my IQ = intelligence (which is nonsense and false) is too low, that I can't do anything, that I'll be disabled. You see, you end up becoming this way, as a result. You effectively become disabled, constrained, and strangled by these debilitating themes.

I should also mention that it seems that much of this is a feeling. There is a rational conscience, knowing what is true, but it's calling from afar, blocked by some black bog. Also, if I believe in the ""new start"", then the belief is that the rational perceiver will come to the front, that I will be intelligent, that I will be allowed to be. The past couple of days have been bad. I was on vacation last week, and I resisted, but the doubts were so bad, and I caved in, thinking it would make me feel better. I took the bait.

For example, along the past number of years, I have read *Basic Mathematics* by Lang maybe over a hundred times (maybe more). All works that I have started I have not finished, although some have been so helpful when I was in the ""right"" state of mind. That book by Lang is great by the way.

I should mention some other fears too, though they relate. In *Daybreak* (as below; sorry, I'm going off my head with little edit), you can see this. Aside from the ""sinner's prayer"", my assumption was that God was rewarding me, that he was giving me powers, that he was making me powerful, more precisely feel powerful, feel right, that he was making me intelligent, that he was protecting me and others, and giving other gifts.

For example, in *Daybreak* by Nietzsche, in the first thirty aphorisms or so, you will see just what is happening. You will see OCD. Nietzsche will walk up to you and point this out (although maybe your OCD will gnash and thrash as it does to trick you into thinking you are crazy and not to be trusted; this too varies depending on the ""new start"" and if it feels right).

All of this led to an awful time in school, a living hell, alongside the rational things (which become at this point hard to disentangle).

You see, in this state, at least in my experience, one becomes totally preoccupied with the thought that ""something is wrong."" This is the case for the social anxiety and depression I mentioned too. In reality, this whole line of thought, with the OCD, is a product, it seems, of socialization and nonsense.

The remedies are really hard. I need to think and perceive (my intelligence needs to be present to deal with the other issues and all issues really), so that is what I took to be the grounding, and as a result sought to escape from. That seems to work, but, for instance, is difficult even today. For example: those works that I read, did I read them before the restart (true)? Though it is true (and so what if not), there is a fear that if I didn't, I'd then be mentally incapacitated and dysfunctional. Then right back to doubting, feeling horrible, mentally blurry and blind, no energy, and needing to ""restart.""

my parents are fine, at least what i see is a healthy relationship. sure, they have their fights and stuff but that's okay, most of those are mild and they never get violent. and don't scream a lot. so i know I've had quite the perfect childhood. my parents didn't.

but something just lit up like a bulb in my head after a fight with my mom today. and she said something like ""i don't think i deserve this kind of treatment from you"" through text because i hadn't answered the phone for a while. i feel really bad but then i just remembered the time when she yelled at me and told me I'd end up sucking to truck drivers on the road, the times she'd explode and threaten me and my dad that she'll leave and storm out pretty late at night. and I'd go cuddle with my dad and he'd have to assure me that it wasn't my fault.

and i think my dad once took some cigarettes from her and she got so mad she went out to buy some and was extremely angry, yelled at both me and my dad.

these days she comments that she would once pack her bags and leave me with dad. or that she'll have a heart attack and die and we'd be left alone. knowing full well dad had a heart attack and even though i never admitted, she knows so well that i was really scared he'd die. the thought of them dying always makes me cry even though i never let them know.

and it kind of connects with my fears of everyone leaving.

and i don't know. I'm just spiralling a bit. maybe i deserve it. i was never a problematic child per say besides occasional tantrums because of stupid stuff and yelling back. otherwise other people would always be complimenting her on how well behaved i am. but i don't know. it just feels like i deserve more of those these days. I'm more frustrated and lash out back a lot more and get angry and yell and i hate it. 

i really didn't want to yell at her today. I was just in a lot of pain because of a pulled neck muscle i think and she thought i was complaining about the school (im studying abroad at a boarding school and she told me that i should make up my mind whether i want to stay here or come back home because the amount of hw will be the same everywhere and that i should be grateful because others don't get as much help with doing all they have to do for school. she did help me a lot with doing hws and stuff so yeah) and homework. because i had literally cried and gotten so angry about having so much work to do and i felt so bad because i couldn't go out and relax a bit and because i was in constant pain. and i didn't feel like answering the phone because i was feeling so shitty. no matter in what position i sat i was still in so much fucking pain.

I'm sorry that this turned into a whole ranting session, i guess i just needed to get all of this off my mind and i don't want to burden my friends. i guess i just wanted to ask if abandonment ocd is a thing because i always have to do these stupid things thinking that if i don't do them someone will start hating me, stop talking to me, leave me alone or stuff and they take up the time, i look weird doing them and they stress me out a lot and i just know that i ruined a few friendships because of my fear and i just really fucked up a lot of times and spend a lot of times obsessing over whether everyone will leave me and whether im just completely... i don't know. i know reddit isn't the best of places to ask for advice but i really just. i don't know. i wantbto stop hurting the people that i care of. and since the school psych doesn't have any time for like a month or so and i can't go to a psych outside school i can't really figure it out. and i hope nothing that i said was offensive, this really isn't my intention. i just feel so tired. 

I'm sorry if this was too incoherent. its late where i am but i know i wont be able to sleep and i ll just keep replying everything in my mind unless i get this off my chest.

thanks to anyone who listened
i wasnt sure what flair to add so i put venting tho im also maybe asking for advice if that's possible.",1,2022-03-19 19:58:05-04:00,"If you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please do not hesitate to talk to someone. The wonderful u/froidinslip has

tidltt,"Please help guys Im alone. Guys , I‚Äôve been diagnosed with OCD in November 2021 after I left mental hospital and I had 2 flare ups of ocd since then , one was one week and second one lasted for about 2 weeks. Ive been taking zoloft 100mg and I went to ERP therapy for about 2 months , and than I stopped because I couldn‚Äôt find time during the day since I was so busy. Now , I think im experiencing it again. Im an international student in America and I‚Äôm alone here. The last 2 episodes I had were almost the same , and the third one is kind of same , but the feelings are different. First 2 episodes were telling me that im depressed , that I will kill myself , that nothing makes sense , that no matter what I do it will not make me feel better. I managed to get out of both episodes by working , studying and not thinking about it and it went away. Now , since few days ago , It started getting bad , but I was still able to function and make conversation. Im scared because I‚Äôm tired and I had weird thoughts about the past and not being sure was I ever really happy . I‚Äôve been obsessing about a lot of stuff and me not being happy and now I‚Äôm scared because I don‚Äôt feel the same as the previous 2 episodes. Im scared because im totally out of energy and Im scared that this may cause me to lose control and harm myself , which I don‚Äôt want !!! Im scared because I was never tired around this time and just so chill even though I have this awful thoughts. I‚Äôve been drinking alcohol from time to time during past month and a half , and I generally had a good time. I was never tired around midnight , and would always go to sleep around 2am etc. Now , for the past 2 days Ive gone to bed before 1 am and I wake up tired !!! Im scared because I took weed vax 2 times before this and I think I may fucked up something in my brain !!! When I try to distract myself , my brain is telling me that its pointless and that I will suffer and kill myself ! Please guys any help or advice , I just want to be sure im not going crazy !!! Im anxious to distract myself because I think there is something else wrong with me and that eventually I will get depressed and try to hurt myself !!! The worst thing is that I kind of distract myself easily but then immediately intrusive thought pops out telling me oh , u didn‚Äôt feel relief , u are depressed and nothing makes u happy !!! U are going to kill urself !! Then I constantly ruminate if I fucked up my brain with that weed , or is it too much sugar or junk food that I ate , am I mentally exhausted etc‚Ä¶. Guys please help .",4,2022-03-20 00:57:37-04:00," Hey. Should clarify I‚Äôm not formally diagnosed, but given my symptoms I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôve had it for around 18 years. Also, I‚Äôm definitely not a licensed professional, and I highly recommend that if there‚Äôs any time you could make in your schedule for seeing one that you do so. It sounds like ERP and Zoloft helped, at least for a bit. So please, if you get the chance, try to make *some* time to speak to a licensed professional.

That being said, there are a few things that‚Äôve somewhat helped me deal with OCD. One thing that‚Äôs occasionally helped me has been to make the fears small. Keep in mind that OCD‚Äôs only real weapon is fear. Ignore it (easier said than done, I know) and what‚Äôs left? Just thoughts. Yeah, they‚Äôre troubling or even scary, but beyond fear what can they actually do to you? You said yourself that you don‚Äôt want to harm yourself. From my perspective, that makes these thoughts ‚Äúunwanted and intrusive‚Äù. That‚Äôs the dictionary definition of the thoughts that often lead to OCD. And from my understanding (again, not a licensed professional but I‚Äôm guessing your therapist suggested something similar to this in your sessions) the solution here is to just move forward with your day, at least if the intrusive thoughts are what worry you. Again, said than done, but it can help.

Also, something else that helps is remembering that you are an entire person - with hopes, fears, ambitions, skills, likes and dislikes, and plenty of other things that make you a complex being. OCD is just one small part of a much larger picture. Gave me some perspective when I realized this. You‚Äôre a person. OCD is - like the name implies - just a disorder. It‚Äôs a problem (and yeah, it‚Äôs a damn tough one) but that‚Äôs it. Again, beyond fear, it has nothing to use against you. Make it small, and it loses a lot of its power.

Also, one more recent realization that‚Äôs kind of helped me has been to learn to ‚Äúroll with the punches‚Äù. I think I have religious and moral OCD, so if I think a blasphemous thought or think of something wrong, I‚Äôve recently decided that acknowledging the thought and moving forward with my day instead of repeating a prayer or some other action is progress. I don‚Äôt want these thoughts, and the sooner I stop letting them control my life, the sooner they‚Äôll stop being significant. Hell, sometimes I even *welcome* the thoughts, because the rush I get from not indulging in compulsions feels super liberating. I‚Äôm not sure how healthy this is, and I don‚Äôt know how applicable this is to your situation, but it might help given that we both at least have OCD. Basically, I‚Äôd boil this tip down to: Embrace the Fuckups.

Last thing: I‚Äôve been at low points thanks to OCD, but what‚Äôs occasionally helped me (at least a little) has been the realization that I want to experience a world where this disease makes little, if any, difference in my life. In that world, I‚Äôm happier, healthier, and not constantly watching out for stray thoughts or actions. That‚Äôs a world I want to experience, and a life I want to live. I think everyone deserves to give themselves the chance to be happy. That includes you. You deserve to give yourself the chance to experience that world. So please don‚Äôt do what you‚Äôre thinking of doing. You owe it to yourself - more than anyone else - to experience a world where OCD is an insignificant (or even nonexistent) part of your life.

Like I said, I‚Äôm not a licensed professional, and I‚Äôm not formally diagnosed. So please speak to a licensed professional if you can find any time for that. And if you just wanna talk about anything, feel free to hit me up. I can‚Äôt guarantee I‚Äôll respond immediately (it‚Äôs kind of late where I am), but I *will* respond in a timely fashion. ### If you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please do not hesitate to talk to someone.

PLEASE USE THE RESOURCES. You matter and deserve help.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/OCD) if you have any questions or concerns.* ### You‚Äôll be okay bud! It might feel horrible now, but OCD plays tricks on you. Just hang in there, and if it‚Äôs night where you are, try to get a good night‚Äôs sleep.

First thing I‚Äôd recommend is trying to avoid alcohol, weed, or drugs when your OCD is flaring up. Substances make the anxiety 101 times worse if you‚Äôre having a flare up.

As far as your brain being permanently messed up, it‚Äôs not. Marijuana has not been medically proven to cause long term damage, so don‚Äôt worry, it hasn‚Äôt messed you up. The long term effects of junk food are at worst cavities and gaining some weight if you aren‚Äôt careful, but it‚Äôs not going to affect your head.

It‚Äôs easy to feel like your going crazy at times with OCD, most of us have felt the same way. It‚Äôs just your head playing tricks on you.

As far as feeling tired, that‚Äôs perfectly normal. During flare ups, I‚Äôve often struggled to sleep well at night, and have woken up after 8 hour sleeps feeling like I slept 2 hours. It‚Äôs just your condition, and yes it can affect sleep. Something I learned as a teenager is that OCD does stay active while you sleep. If you go to bed in a state of distress, your body will stay that way while you sleep and you won‚Äôt wake up feeling well rested. It can also affect your dreams which flippin‚Äô sucks, but it‚Äôs comforting to know that it‚Äôs normal for people with OCD. There is medication to treat this, and for me it worked wonders.

Take some time to get some rest if you feel like you need it, and contact your doctor as soon as you can. They can help you get this under control.

As for medication, everyone is different. Some medication helps some people, but does nothing for others. It also takes time for your body to adjust to medication, so hang in there and keep in contact with your doctor.

As far as worrying about hurting yourself or others, that‚Äôs very common for OCD. We think of the worst possible thing imaginable, and our OCD convinces is it‚Äôs real or says something about us. It‚Äôs just the illness, and you aren‚Äôt alone. People with OCD are some of the most harmless people around specifically because we‚Äôre scared of our skin to even think of doing something violent.

Again, if you find you‚Äôre struggling too much, contact your doctor, they can help.

Take care of yourself and do something that helps you relax. I personally find that Tetris is always a great distraction when I panic, for example. Try to avoid caffeine, liquor, weed, etc., it will probably just make things worse.

Hang in there, things will get better! ### Thanks a lot man !!!!!!! Appreciate it ! ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tidltt/please_help_guys_im_alone/

thtr1y,"Having a bad day Sometimes it just feels like I‚Äôm not allowed to enjoy anything.

 Brace your self   
okay, so anyone else feels more focused/productive with 4/5 hours of sleep?  
I can wake up and stay all day long 0 carbs, only black coffee (sugar free) and I would be super focused/motivated and get stuff done..once I get home in the evening to study...I eat and I once I eat I cannot focus, mood gets bad and don't feel as sharp..I used to starve my self and literally eat one meal every two days so that I don't let food mess up my mood but seriously it's not like I get depressed..it's just I can't focus(brain fog) lethargic as well and don't feel like studying nor working nor anything!! I get spasms, heart palpitations and swollen fingers(damages arteries from lack of blood flow due to so little carbs) I get white /cold fingers after eating (I think the heart takes blood from fingers to stomach or..it happes 99% after eating) my grades are low and only way to study is to not eat, but that's not healthy and not logical!nutrient deficiencies seriously messed me up! the mind clarity I get fro not eating all day long is unmatched !! but at what cost??? any feedback/help/explanation is sincerely appreciated.  
note: my bp is fine ! when I eat well and when I starve my self, when I only eat one meal a day consisting of around 50g of carbs I get around 120/80 bp ,when I take it to extremes with carbs I get around 110/90..nothing less..also my blood sugar levels are fine when fasting and after eating ! however ! I went through a trauma the last couple of years and since then I've been having a light dull pain around liver/gallblader that only occurs after eating..I went to numerous doctors,did all the tests..nothing was found ! I am extremely anxious I'll give you that! but I'm not sure anxiety is the reason since it only happes after eating.  
I took xanax when extremely low carbs, didn't feel a thing, I also took zoloft, also nothing, then a year later, I took anafranil , it stopped my heart palpitations/chest pains/side pain as well even after eating shit loads of food which is weird ! my only explanation was that the medication only drugged my brain so much that it masked the feelings of pain even though they were present in the body meaning the pain actually occurs but I don't feel it because the medication perhaps affected the area of the brain to feel pain or something like that, this is just an explanation. and I stopped the medication cause it made me cravefood extremely fatigued and I got fired for not being productive (the med contributed), I took ritalin, it helped enormously, but masking the brain fog (even though life saving) doesn't it tell you that there is an underlying issue that should be treated?  
Now I am on  2nd day 20mg lamictal, didn't do anything.., perhaps because extremely low carbs which makes central nervous sleepy and not rambling so there is less firing in the neurons (like coffee/ritalin I can barely feel them when I don't eat carbs) so perhaps that's why lamictal didn't do much but I remember ever since I started I felt even more depressed and anxious/hyper aware depersonalyzed 24/7 fight or flight mode / each second at work is felt slowed 100 times more than usual/feel like panicking all that time without actual panic attacks it's like a state of panic that is continuous all day long ! I remained by carbs low and that helped reduce anxiety to a huge degree ! however not rational ! and not a solution ! my psych doubts I have bipolar so he put me on lamictal, I had weird dreams, a spot of empty hair on my head, fatigue, no rash so far but I believe it made me feel worse, I heard it becomes better, but for how long should I stay low carb and not suffer until lamictal starts giving positive effects so that when I up the carbs I only feel the positives meaning I would have surpassed by that time the negative feelings by low carbs??  
important note, since I am anxious and obsessing about diseases I spent a shit ton of money on blood tests and scans, 90% of docs told me I'm just anxious, but here's the catch !   
all the tests turned normal but I stumbled on an article that correlates heart or chest pain to over active adrenal glands, so I did a major test, and turns out my adrenal glands were secreting a higher than usual amount of something I forgot what it was, and when I researched (regardless of whether google lies or not) I found that over secretion of that substance or hormone may indicate a tumor benign or not, it's a tumor. so you tell me..I have been having chest pains, side pain in flank area, sometimes happens even when I don't eat,and pain in my kidneys area, and pain in my liver region, spasms all over my body and you think all this is just anxiety?  First I never knew how anxiety was, I thought it was just a hyper state of extreme fear but now I think I have been accustomed to being afraid so much for so long that I cannot tell if I am anxious or being normal! I have been through a lot, especially in pandemic, turned homeless, eating one can of sardines every other day, putting 1-2 table spoons of white table salt in two liters of water for the day to compensate for low bp and dizziness (which was dumb) and I did keto that time as well , thought since I'm homeless I might as well starve and take the opportunity to lose weight since I don't even have money.  
the most important thing in this story is this : I don't know if this is some spiritual/energetic/aura effect or purely physiological and only physiological or not , but I one night when I was in utter suffering and constant fear from the horrors of being homeless and the traumas I saw, I thought now or never, I did the cold shower it was around november pure winter, not hot then cold, no, straight cold, I was so sick and demented and animalistic I couldn't care , I was literally I monster inside against the world and how cruel it was, so I wasn't beta at all, I felt like a sick mofo especially the mind clarity and heightened state of mind (although extreme fatigue could barely walk couple of blocks due to starvation, i FELT DRAGGIN MY FEET -LITERALLY) anyways, I went into the shower straight cold ! , okay I thought now what..nothing happened..3 days later all my symptoms vanished 95% no heart chest pains, no side pains, nothing !!! I was hooked !   
another thing: in that very period, coffee even a sip , literally 1 sip ! like you won't believe it when I say literally one sip , 5 mins later I start getting an extreeeeeeme sharp  chest pain , everytime I think this is it !!! also when I drank water back then I had breathing difficulties, it felt literally like my diaphragm was too heavy to pull a breath and I had to do much more effort to pull a breath (not a smoker), the water when I drank it gave me chest pains as well and heavy breathing, I thought well maybe this is an electrolight problem, I did tests, nothing ! it was and still is hard to believe that anxiety can cause such symptoms, not just doubts the thing is the pains were felt sooo realistically, like I would press on the spot and the pain would grow bigger! I can't be imagining this shit !!!! but I'm open and not a close minded person so it could be I don't know. Now I drink coffee although I get heart palpitations(rarely) no chest pains occur, water however when I drink too much too quickly causes a little bit of chest pain, perhaps I hurt my kidneys in starvation period , I litereally remember my self one night, after like 2 nights no food, when I felt sleepy and and fell asleep on a chair or something (not willingly) in the midst of that moment, between awakening and right before going into sleep and closing your eyes, just when I closed my eyes i FELT a huge heart heavy pain that went away 2 seconds after I woke up from the pain. also when I slept in the streets I'll never forget this one, I layed down to sleep and mid sleep I woke up grasping for air it felt as if my lungs almost gave up on me - terror ! I was constantly having horrendous kidney pains back then especially with only water salt consumption which later on led to water retention in legs , one side of face ...(now gone) that night when I was in the streets I measure/counted my heart beats per minute, it was around 50 ! I was shocked! this shiit was bad. even the most athletic don't get to 50.  
so long story shott, I've alllways been sleepy after food and moody and lacked focus and motivation, even when I was a kid, so long before all this trauma/starvation happened. I remember however I was anxious since childhood, ocd , beta boy get beaten and never back fires, mind rushing thoughts, huge lack of desire to study, I actually was about to write a book trying to convince the world how studying and going to school was the most supid thing and I tried to bring about other systemic approaches to teaching, doing my best to rationalyze my hatred towards school. I also remember in high school , I was so hyper aware(dp-dr) of my self, like thinking about thinking about the fact I was thinking of that very fact and noticing how I am  thinking about all of this in a spiral never ending cycle. in class every second was heavier than ever, my realization of this made everything worse, the fact that I was aware and hyper conscious of the fact that I had to wat two looong ffuing hours of suffering waiting in this class was tormenting !! that time It was so unbearable that I thought about going to a psychiatrist, not to be treated (I never thought I was sick/avoided chemical meds) but to only get a priscription (regardless whether I am ill or not) that states I am in a difficult psychological state and would allow me to be absent when I don't feel like it. the system was strict, you get absent your parents get called, you get a warning, your parents get very angry at you and then at the administration telling them why are you asking me to come, should I leave my job and come to see you every time?! don't I have anything else to do? many parents suffered this, but long story short, I never went to a psychiatrist. I hated school so much and everything was so difficult, I failed 3 times and repeated 3 times. the fourth one made it and just over the minimum. then went to university, got my BA with huge difficulty, and dropped out for two years, thought I'd take a rest. and it was a hell of rest, I lost two years of my life working enslaving jobs with extremly dismal pay. which made me the monster I am today. :) such a beautiful world ..I always thought serial killers were born. here's the catch. turned out they were made. (now you may discuss using different approaches and so I could bring about as well the rationality of the realtivity of the principle of relativity and that no one owns the absolute truth which means your claim is bound to being so relative that you might as well keep silent and save the calories but relatively speaking from what I read and saw documentaries, psychos and serial killers mostly had a disturbed past, now my mom I can assure you she is obsessed, paranoid like damn hyper paranoid won't even describe it , and I don't know perhaps she passed me her genetics...had she not used me to satisfy her mom needs to be called mommy, I would have never wen through the terrible shit I went through. now I laugh with friends, but the gloominess inside and pessimism even Schopenhauer the great pessimist of philosophers would seem optimistic towards it. now I don't ever ever want to have children why in the world would I make money and spend it on a child ? the F did he give to me to give my hard earned money to him? so that he can deprive me from sleep at 4 am and I wipe his ass? I was never able to see where in the world people could find pleasure in having kids.  I was like this since 12 or 14...now I despise kids and their noise, I wish I could slap them and tell them to shut the f up , I'm just being honest here.. I don't bare their noise. I went through other stuff which I'm not willing to discuss now which contributed to the distorted person I am today...but believe me...when you slap someone in the face..you create a crying enfant. in other times, you create a monster..ah ...had it not been my faith in god..I would have don things only god would know. and after the years of analysis, I admit I am not normal and I am sick :) due to some humans  after all, life on earth was never meant to be beautiful, it was meant to be war filled and crime filled , with diseases and sadness, other wise heaven would not be heaven. in other words, if we never got thirsty, we would never know how valuable a sip of water is. and for those who going to jump , this is not a religious debate, I was just saying that religion contributes a lot to preventing bad behaviour . plus, no one know the truth right? means you don't have the absolute truth either by claiming atheism.   
long story short ..I have been anxious before all the shit I went through..so the ocd/anxiety that started in childhood had nothing in relation to thefollowing traumas. my question is how in the world if it is even possible for anxiety/depression to cause such realistic pains upon which pressure leads to further pain.  
for those who would ask how I could write all this...pain, suffering, desperation to have answers and have someone listen to you and give you a solution would make me sell my balls to enjoy life instead of this way. so writing is a peace of cake , also in that period of trauma and homelessness i wrote (ba in english) what I think is one of the most valuable works of art written in thrilleer/fiction literature. built on true stories I went through. why I believe it's truely a powerful work of art, not because I am narcissistic, no, I am not, I hate my self that tells you something. but it's because I have a deep belief in that the most beautiful art, is created from the most painful instances in life. one of the Algerian writers called ""ahlem mosteghanmi"" says ""from a wrotten wound emerges literature"", this hit me hard and you will never know what I mean until you read it. if you ever want to read it , it's only around 200 pages, and I can send it for free :) I don't have money to publish it, but if you believe it's worth publishing , please let me know.   
one more thing , the fact that I said ""but if you believe it's worth publishing"" proves that I had doubts which means I am not a narcissist and I am not blindly saying it's indisputably excellent art.  
or maybe I just put that sentence to trick you into belieing I'm not narcissist when I actually am?  or maybe I am not but I am trying to seem smart or maybe I am but trying to divert you from believing that I am a narcissist ? see the cycles of consciousness? it never ends. this was just for two seconds. imagine 24hours a day.   
FOCUS ! if you want to read the book don't be shy :) also there is a coding in a letter in the book, so if you decode it (which isn't that hard) you'll understand things you've never understood nor thought were existing .   
I remember the first day I took ritalin, I called my mom wish I haven't seen in months, ( I was senseless emotionless monster ) I picked up the phone and I said ""mom, I just wanted to tell you I love you"" that wasn't me, that's when I knew the med was talking. I felt no euphoria, it was plain peacefulness and a calm sense of wellbeing, everything was positive, the world was beautiful and I doubted for a second not having kids, but then I wasn't too sure to accept that responsibility (may be a do have adhd since I was a lazy ass all my life, well just after primary school, I was good"" now if you people feel that way without meds all the time..I need a software reboot cause this shit is unbelievle ! like my uncle is a fucking millionnaire literally, I think now I understand how the f he managed to reach that level, doing business and all that, he was always positive he told me once don't let your self get stuck in monotony, it kills, you have to change things. the guy was so f ing discipled and was working constantly all the time whereas all I cared about is to just stay home and watch movies. Neurons baby..when they work in a ritalin-like state, they can make you a whole other person. genetics..he was lucky, now for the ritalin, I'm not sure if a sick person when taking it in normal doses matches the state that of a healthy person or not. if yes then I have been drprived of the joys of life of being at peace in full harmony (like when I was on ritalin, ) if no, ...then...I forgot, it's like an ocd that makes me push my self to forget or actually forget since my mind is fried after all the stress...I remember once I had an anxiety episode, I literally felt my back on fire, like a jolt of extreme and quick split second fire/electricity sensation on my back and especially side...my baby brain is fried yall, so fried, your fried eggs would appear raw - hell- unshelled even when on your plate.   
I can't afford meds nor psychiatry visits, I can barely pay my bills and I feel enslaved I don't even know how I am going to be able to work , the job is mentally tiring, it's a call center..the only job that hired me after being fired from all the others saying your performence was not as expected..., can you smell it? smells like adhd. ""how many times do we have to repeat this to you""? ""what are you thinking about""? ""you forget too much"" oh and the most beautiful part is that I don't just speak to a person, I realize that I am listening to him which makes me ocd and focus on the words coming from his lips and the voice which distracts me from the meaning and I ended saying what do you mean, instead of saying I'm sorry you were speaking chinese. asie from that the guys talks to me, looks me in the eyes, where do I look at ? at the direction his eyes are looking through. and ask my self why do humand jump from looking to my right eye to the left eye then back to my right eye, then sometimes to my mouth, which is weird, cause they don't need to, I blind can fully understand you, I noticed one day that animals are sickeningly smart..since I was hyper aware, I noticed things most people never notice. I looked at a cat a athought came in. the cat was looking at me straight in the face, not my legs, not my abdomen, my face and probably my eyes as well. the son of a b could make the difference and know our central portal of communication, now I know they instinctivly banged and knew to lick their genitals and smell their nose and lick eachothers faces but humans what does they have to do with communicating with us so well that they knew where to look at us when they spoke/asked for food. or just even looked at us staring.  
finally..my pains? after about 3 years now, reduced to a lot but not completely disappeared. I can swear each time I do cold showers I make them disappear 100% for at least an entire week then they start coming back.  
my pains?  
now, for the pains, any help?",2,2022-03-19 18:10:38-04:00,"This is a lot and tbh I did not read it all, I skimmed. I have to wonder how much coffee you are consuming due to the symptoms you‚Äôve mentioned. If you are taking no other stimulants, I wonder if your caffeine intake is excessive. 

Looking for a less triggering job should be helpful. I‚Äôm not sure what you‚Äôre home life is like, but find ways to reduce stress. High caffeine intake, anxiety, little sleep, and skipping meals can lead to many physical and mental health issues, too many to list. Some things you‚Äôve mentioned that I saw while skimming could be explained by those things though. 

I get where you‚Äôre coming from. I used to feel better caffeinated and not eating, sleeping 5-6 hours a night. I was go go go. Eating always made me feel terrible and nonfunctional. An old man told me in my early 30‚Äôs I‚Äôd better slow down or I‚Äôll get slowed down. A few years later and that happened. I had a whole lot of physical and mental health issues arise. More recently I have been healing my body. I stay well below 400mg of caffeine a day. I sleep 7-8 hours a night and get to sleep by midnight, which are critical for healing. I eat small meals throughout the day, not quite keto, but close to it. I take b-vitamins, a multi, and 4 grams of fish oil split doses. I have reduced the stress in my life as much as possible and try to be mindful of where I‚Äôm at and adjust as necessary. I am also in therapy. I believe taking these steps could help you as well. 

Insurance can be affordable if you are in the USA. On the marketplace you sacrifice your tax return for insurance basically. That‚Äôs why I now have it. My copay is $5 a visit. Now I don‚Äôt have an excuse not to get help for my issues like OCD and anxiety. I don‚Äôt want to make excuses anymore, I want to get better. My OCD made it feel impossible to get help because of intrusive thoughts, I told my therapist the first visit how crazy and messed up I am. She told me I couldn‚Äôt tell her anything she hasn‚Äôt heard yet nor anything that would shock her or turn her away and the fact that I‚Äôm self reflecting in this manner shows hope already. She was right of course, OCD is a freaking monster and I was being ridiculous, for many years. I have had a very troubled childhood and a tumultuous adulthood. My OCD and anxiety made me feel literally like a monster and there was much I refused to speak of. Now there is nothing I don‚Äôt share with my therapist, no matter how f‚Äôd up it is. It has made all the difference in the world. 

I know for me I just had to stop. I was driving myself into a nightmare, the more high strung I got the more I believed this is the way it has to be. There‚Äôs so many physiological responses happening in that state that drive it, the only way out is to just stop and start taking baby steps for yourself. If you can relate to any of this I hope it helps and I hope you find peace and healing. ### thank youuuu <3 ### ",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/ti68g8/ocd_the_creation_of_a_monster/
ticnyn,"Asking for help on how to cope with OCD Hii, I hope you guys are doing ok. I‚Äôm new here, and have been diagnosed with OCD about 8 years ago. I have learned so much about this disorder that I feel like I know it from head to toe, yet I still find it so hard to deal with, which is at the very least really frustrating. The most strong type of OCD I have to deal with is the perfectionist one, so like, there are certain things in my day to day life which I have to do just the ‚Äúright way‚Äù, or until I feel like it‚Äôs ‚Äújust right‚Äù. And this has worsened to the point that my body won‚Äôt let me perform these triggering actions, like someone is literally holding me back, just to avoid the anxiety. So, when I try to use my phone, I want to use it, but it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm stuck, frozen, paralyzed. And when I try to expose myself to the imaginary danger OCD is warning me about and actually perform whatever I‚Äôm supposed to do, while trying to ignore all these obsessions and weird motor symptoms, it‚Äôs almost unbearable, I start to question reality, like, if I‚Äôm trying to use my phone again, I start questioning if I really am using it, or if I‚Äôm just imagining it all, and whether something bad is going to happen, something I could prevent, that kind of stuff. So, I really would like to know if you guys feel anything similar? And if so, how do you deal with it? I hope you all have a great day and stay strong!",2,2022-03-19 23:58:50-04:00,"If you were diagnosed, you must have been given medication. It‚Äôs a sickness. Why aren‚Äôt you taking medication and therapy to address it? ### Rightt, I forgot to mention that, ever since I‚Äôve been diagnosed I‚Äôve been on meds and cognitive behavioral therapy. Everything I learned so far about OCD has been through therapy, and the antidepressants managed to hold OCD back for a few years, but that‚Äôs where things got kinda messy. I‚Äôve had every SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) so far, and the only ones that managed to make feel better were sertraline and fluoxetine, but both of them stopped working after a while, for some reason. And the other SSRI meds gave me too much collateral effects, even after months of intake, especially sleepiness, drowsiness, and since I‚Äôm a student, I can‚Äôt afford to feel extremely tired all the time. Some meds also gave me other random side effects which were really inconvenient, like increase in libido and manic episodes. So last year final months I asked my psychiatrist to stop meds, I feel like ever since I started taking them I had to give some part of myself in order to get either some limited recovery or a mediocre one. And it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm doing this blindly too, I was well aware OCD was going to worsen when I decided to stop meds, but since there are plenty of people that handle OCD with therapy only, I decided to give it a shot ### ",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/ticnyn/asking_for_help_on_how_to_cope_with_ocd/
ticcqs,"How to do exposures, what if you take them too far? This post is gonna be really long and TMI(maybe even a bit inappropriate), so I apologize in advance, but I really need help.

So, I'm gonna take a hypothetical example. Suppose someone peed while sitting on a chair(or just anywhere), and even if its just a little bit or a lot, if it happened once, any normal person might clean it if it did get on the surface, but if it happened repeatedly (or even once)and you didn't clean for the sake of exposures, even a normal person would associate the chair to urine, find it dirty, not use it, probably throw it away, etc. Even they'd find it disgusting and anyone who used it without thinking about it at all or finding it disgusting, would be unhygienic, ignorant and disrespectful, especially if its a chair for communal use. It'll be stuck in at least the subconscious of a normal person, and even they'd ask others not to use it. All this seems to justify my OCD, or at least prove the exposures to be wrong. I don't even have OCD about urine, but I'd still clean Or maybe its all acceptable as exposures, although people might still avoid you and your belongings, house, wouldn't wanna be near you, etc., but its absolutely disgusting and unacceptable (and unhygienic and unhealthy) in the normal world, especially if I continue to the exposures, no matter how big, as a preference in the future, because I'm used to it, but I'm not supposed to be.

I have contamination OCD of sexual fluids, wouldn't the same stuff apply for this too? I've been doing exposures with my clothes on and I'm aware I'm gonna also have to do it without my clothes on and partially clothed for exposures, but if I do it repeatedly (or even once) in the same place over and over, whether or not its designated for that particular thing, its like I can almost only ""see"" and feel and think about the contamination on it all day, its forever stuck in my head, and thus it has that ""additional"" contaminant on it which other chairs/or whatever object it is, don't.

Without cleaning at all, and without thinking about it, wouldn't it make that place like a toilet or an underwear, and make me a mad and mental person for not being bothered at all in any way, because all normal people would face OCD like symptoms and react to it similarly to some extent? Am I thus not supposed to clean it, if yes how? Soap and water? The way I used to for OCD or some other way? If I start, I'm gonna make sure its entirely clean and/or feel the need to clean everything else around it and all the cross contaminated things, I just can't help it because I started, and if I don't I'll be bothered by thoughts at least to some extent, and can't stop no matter what, like I mentioned above about the thoughts, obsessions, questions, doubts, fears, themes, etc. But if I don't, then I'm dirty, ignorant, etc. 

 It might even prove to be harmful, health wise, hygiene wise, brain and mentality wise, or just in any way possible, even though my main concern is disgust. And this again might prove to be the new fear, obsession, doubt, question, theme, thought, etc. 

 I'm worried and always compare to normal standards like this. 

I'd appreciate if I could get some advice on this.",5,2022-03-19 23:40:23-04:00,"[deleted] ### Don‚Äôt do anything at all freeze and do something else ### Thank you so much for this, its extremely helpful and I really appreciate it:)

Wiping down obvious contamination is fine, but in my case I'm really not sure, because I have my clothes on, but doing it repeatedly in the same place, wouldn't the fluids somehow get onto the surface through the clothes? I know its not visible and not as much, and that's the reason I refrain from cleaning, but I can feel it and doing it in the same place again and again makes it worse. Its almost like I'm sure, but I'm not, if that makes any sense. Even without clothes, I'm not sure what to do if there's very little or no visible contamination. And if there is something (a lot or little) I don't know how to clean it, like only that particular spot, the entire surface, with or without everything around it and what touched it(cross contamination), immediately or later, can I sit in other places after sitting there, what do I use to clean it(soap, wipes, etc.) and how do I know what I should use, what if its something I can't clean like it'll get damaged or whatever, etc. I just get so many questions for the smallest things, they keep coming, seem genuine, and they just never stop. I find it so hard to tell something's genuine or ocd. ### [deleted] ### Thank you so much, and I totally relate to redditing during work haha.

I understand how the ""contamination"" is totally harmless, but the thing is my issue is just disgust, like I mentioned in the post. I do exposures, live with it, but the feeling of disgust never leaves. I compare the things in my house with everything, and how other furniture, objects, others' houses or just anything is clean and doesn't have that ""extra"" contamination on it. I do not seem to care about germs and falling sick as much, its just come up as a small new concern since I started doing exposures.

Sometimes I'm sure there's contamination, but I can't see it, and then I question if I should clean it or not, because not cleaning would be disgusting, apparently even according to normal standards, and cleaning it would mean my ocd is somewhat justified and this is disgusting. I'm just scared of crossing normal standards, getting used to it, and continuing it in the future out of mere convenience, only to be a ""dirty"", ""disgusting"" and ""unhygienic"" person. I'm afraid I'm sure there's contamination, but I'm not cleaning it thinking its ocd, which is possible, but its also reasonable and rational, and I'm taking it too far or doing it all wrong.
And my issue is also that when I contaminate the place once, it's still comparatively easier to geto ver whether or not there's contamination that doing it repeatedly in the same place. That makes me almost certain that it's contaminated, disgusting and I associate it with that particular contaminant and activity. And the fact my family uses the same place or objects or whatever,  have no idea about this and don't even expect it makes it worse and makes me feel guilty and shameful for spreading it around and to others. ### [deleted] ### Yes exactly, usually erp is for proving that your fears won't come true, but in my case, there is no fear. In fact, the only fear is I'll be living in filth forever and I'll feeling disgusting and it won't leave my head, and that's exactly what's happening. 

Definitely, take your time, thank you so much for the help! ### [deleted] ### Thank you! I agree with you, and I've been trying to ""adequately clean"" and do exposures, but i do not know what would be considered adequate cleaning, and if my exposures are crossing the line. Asking about it would be reassurance, and if I've crossed the line, I'd freak out and get anxious, which means it should be done as an exposure. But the exposure is beyond normal standards. Plus if I get used to it, I may continue it in the future out of convenience, which again brings me back to the fact I'd be ""unhygienic"", ""ignorant"", ""dirty and disgusting"" and stuff. I'm scared it would affect my mentality (ik it sounds so silly, but the things OCD does to you) and people would be weirded out by how ignorant I am when it comes to hygiene and how it doesn't bother me, and it would rewire my brain and make me mental or something.
I've had this theme for around 4 years now. Before this, I'd not engaged in any sexual activity so there was no dealing with any sort of fluids, thoughts or feelings (basically OCD). I do think it has something to do with how my parents deemed masturbation to be a ""very bad thing to do"" when I was a kid, since many kids do it unknowingly at that time, and I had no idea it was masturbation, they just told me it's something wrong. I this always had that shame associated with it, which is gone to a certain extent now, after I've read positive things about such things online and here on reddit, because I had no idea and very little knowledge on these topics. ### ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/ticcqs/how_to_do_exposures_what_if_you_take_them_too_far/
tic6rg,"I don't know if I have counting OCD or not but please help me out. I love to play chess on a website named [chess.com](https://chess.com). this website tells you about the number of mistakes and blunders you have done. One day I casually added the number of mistakes I performed in my last two matches. At that time a thought came to my mind that I won't be able to stop myself from adding these mistakes and turned off the auto-analysing feature of the website.

Everything was alright after that but 4 days ago while I was reading a discussion on reddit I subconsciously counted the number of letters in a word and thought that I won't be able to stop myself from counting the number of letters cuz words are part of our everyday life. I brush aside the obsession most of the time but I won't be able to do it forever. The anxiety is building up day by day and now I'm totally depressed. I lost my interest from everything.

If there is anyone out here who had gone through the same experience as mine then please tell me how you avoided the obsessive thoughts.

I might not be able to seek professional help due to the stigma present in my society.

I had experienced obsessive thoughts in March 2021 as well but they were about checking my mathematical solutions and I was able to overcome them in just one month and was totally fine for the past one year and now I caught a new type of obsession which seems completely unavoidable.

I'd like to start off by saying, OCD loves to play such tricks and almost ""tease"" you into becoming its slave again. Since it latches onto your fear, which in this case is the fear of developing a new obsession, OCD uses that against you.

This happens especially during or after ERP, or when you start to challenge you OCD. The only thing that's helped me was to use ERP strategies irrespective of the theme, due to the amount of new fears and doubts I was hit with. I just accept it, mock it too sometimes, just go ""oh yeah I'm totally so scared of this, this is definitely going to be my new obsession, it might harm me beyond levels I can imagine, I love this anxiety"". Apart from this, no matter how long that thing stays in my head, I do not react in ANY WAY. Reacting = giving importance. Let the thoughts stay, in fact, happily welcome them in, to make sure your brain realizes you couldn't care less.

I hope this helped, and I wish you all the best! ### I no longer feel any anxiety but I have lost all my emotions, desires. I can avoid the urges to count letters but still I end up counting letters numerous times a day. Whenever someone says something, my mind shows me the images of the words/phrases he said. I couldn't even sleep more than 4 hours and spend the rest of the night lying sleepless on the bed.

thxpz6,"Difference between OCD and ‚Äòocd tendencies‚Äô I know a lot of people have a few things that resemble OCD compulsions, they might walk on a certain tile whenever they walk into the kitchen for example, however for about 3-4 years I have had intrusive thoughts and many compulsions that often interfere with my life. It is mainly themed around harm and most of my compulsions involve numbers and avoiding specific objects. I had a therapist for about a year, and whenever I brought it up she completely resisted the idea that I had OCD, and instead just said ‚Äòwe all do things like that sometimes‚Äô.

I know it is pretty common to have the odd one or two things that resemble compulsions for OCD, but for me it does generally cause a lot of distress in a daily basis, and I genuinely think I have OCD.

thma9g,"My 10 lessons, strategies and tools for living a good life with OCD. I've come along way on my recovery journey (which I continue and may always continue) and these are the most important things I've learnt which have immensely helped me. However, I first want to stress that your main priority for recovery should be seeing a psychologist who understands OCD and ERP. 

Anyway, here are the lessons, tools and strategies which have most helped me:

1. Do not engage in physical or mental compulsions under any circumstances. This includes reassurance and confession, which are two of the most dangerous compulsions. Actively label the compulsion and be mindful.¬†


2. You never need to figure out the significance or truth of the obsession or trigger. Even though OCD is a liar, and the obsessions are going to feel as real as they can possibly feel, trying to figure it out still never helps. That's the mental compulsion. Sit with the discomfort and let it pass.


3. Embrace uncertainty. 'Maybe' is liberating. You can never truly be certain about anything and you must accept that. This is especially important for false/real event OCD. You can never truly figure out the past (or predict the future!) , and you definitely can't change it. So embrace uncertainty. ANYTHING good or bad could happen to anyone at any time. That's just life and we must accept it.¬†


4. Don't avoid triggers. Treat them as a good opportunity to accept some temporary anxiety, resist a compulsion and be mindful while you observe the anxiety pass without engaging with the obsession or compulsion. This doesn't mean you do this compulsively and need to seek triggers out (unless practising ERP), but you shouldn't avoid them when they appear.


5. 'Wear the anxiety like an uncomfortable coat' (Robert Bray) and live your life anyway. Bring it with you and accept it on holidays and special occasions. You can still have a great time while anxious. You could still have a wonderful life, even if you had consistent anxiety. 'Get busy living, or get busy dying.'


6. Embrace unconditional self acceptance (Albert Ellis). Remember there is no such thing as good and bad people - just behaviours. No behaviour can universally rate a person. Instead, accept that you are a fallible human being who does good behaviours, bad behaviours (and makes mistakes!) and entirely accept yourself regardless while recognising your infinite potential to behave better in future. To do this, you must also unconditionally accept others and treat them with compassion.¬†


7. Practise Stoicism. Unconditionally accept the things which are outside your control; the choices you make in the present are the only thing you have control over. It had to happen like this and everything is predetermined. The entire past has brought you to this present moment. Also, remember that nothing is good or bad, but thinking makes it so. Treat all adversity as a test from the Stoic gods. You do well by reacting calmly and framing the situation positively.¬†


8. Rationally dispute your fears (Albert Ellis). Nothing is awful enough to justify extreme ongoing anxiety. Reject musts and instead use preferences. E.g. 'I would prefer this bad thing doesn't happen, but I can get through it and still experience some forms of peace and happiness if it does happen.'¬†


9. Practise mindfulness and meditation. Stay in the present, not the future or past as the present is the only time that exists. Thoughts arise from nowhere and disappear into oblivion so let them pass and remember 'you are not your next thought'. Thoughts themselves are powerless unless we identify with them. Also remember there is no self or free will. Most importantly - everything that has the nature to arise must also pass away; this is especially true for emotions, no matter how bad you feel at the time.¬†


10. Form healthy habits. Get up at the same time every day. Aim for least 7 hours sleep a night. Regularly exercise. Spend time outside and appreciate nature. Meditate every morning. Keep a gratitude journal. Eat healthily. Avoid excessive alcohol consumption. Limit your phone use and news/social media consumption. Be social and spend time and connect with family and friends. Read good books. Study philosophy and practise what you learn. Move, get out into the world and get free from your comfort zone. Make decisions according to your values, not the lies OCD spins you.¬†


A final note: sometimes you will just feel anxious or down for no reason except for the chemicals in your brain. Everything will seem triggering and it will be hard to think calmly. All you can do is use the aforementioned tools and strategies and allow the emotional state to pass like it always has and always will do. 'There will come a day when you feel better, and you will rise up free and easy on that day' (The Mountain Goats).¬†",13,2022-03-18 23:12:32-04:00,"All of this ‚Ä¶thank you so much for sharing! I need to put this in the wall for constant reminder ! ### Well said ### awesome! thanks for sharing. 1) alone almost cures OCD :). ### Awesome, positive post. 

I gave #5 quite alot of thought. ### As someone who recently had to deal with OCD symptoms for months this is very helpful, so thanks for the tips. I'll make sure to apply them when I notice the intrusive obsessions happening. ### Really good advice. I‚Äôd add that as part of 6, be gentle with yourself when give into a compulsion. When you make a mistake on the path to recovery, it doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôll never recover; it means you‚Äôre human. Just notice that it happened, pick yourself up, and try again.

Great post :) ### i can‚Äôt embrace uncertainty, not when my thoughts include ‚Äúwhat if i become a ______ in the future?‚Äù that isn‚Äôt something i‚Äôm willing to embrace. ### This is such a good post, it‚Äôs so great so see some genuinely thoughtful and helpful ideas. I‚Äôm about to finish ERP/CBT where we‚Äôve gone through most of these with testing/evidence, and it has genuinely been life changing. 

I‚Äôm a little unsure of #7 though - I don‚Äôt think you need to agree that everything is predetermined and that everything is meant to happen how it does. If something negative happened because of a choice you made, I think it‚Äôs okay to self-reflect, it‚Äôs just about having that healthy framing technique to review it calmly - and just once - like, okay that event/decision didn‚Äôt go the best, but the world hasn‚Äôt ended, now what‚Äôs a good, logical solution (if needed)? Or if it‚Äôs genuinely very likely to happen again, how can I respond differently that isn‚Äôt going to be detrimental to my mental health or others‚Äô? ### You're welcome. It's taken me a long time to get to this point but I hope some of this stuff is helpful for other people. ### I reckon 5 is one of the most important points. The amount of holidays I've let OCD ruin is shocking. That said, I went away for 2 weeks last year and felt great the whole time. There's hope! ### You should look up a YouTube channel called NOCD. They do some really great videos that might help you. OCD Recovery also do some good stuff. ### Thanks! Congrats on taking such a positive step toward you're recovery.

I totally see where you are coming from on #7. For me, I guess it's a bit of a spiritual thing/way of finding meaning in life but definitely subjective.

Best of luck on your journey! ### That makes sense, I‚Äôm not spiritual at all so that‚Äôll be why that part doesn‚Äôt connect for me, but I‚Äôm glad it works for you and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll work for others with a strong spiritual mindset.

ti6okr,"Severe Fear Of Rabies Making My Life Miserable Hi everyone. I have been diagnosed with severe OCD for around 4 years. I was on medication but stopped taking it due to nasty side effects. I also don‚Äôt have the money right now to afford a therapist. I had gotten to the point where I could manage it up until a couple weeks ago. This is when the fear of rabies presented itself. I fear it‚Äôs on every surface I touch and every animal I see has it. 

I work in a grocery store nothing unusual I just carry out peoples groceries and check them out. Last Saturday a man came in and after checking him out I noticed he had a dog tied up outside. The dog started bouncing up on him and biting at his sleeves and I immediately convinced myself the dog had rabies and the saliva was on his sleeves which I thought now touched an open would on my hand. I cried all day in fear of having rabies and begged my parents to get me a shot. They refused and I managed to calm myself down and get better about 4 days later.

The weren‚Äôt biting or barking or being aggressive In anyway. But I still feared they had rabies. When I was putting her groceries in I had gotten a bit of saliva that was from my mouth (50% sure It was mine) on my lips and my nose.

ti9vav,"Questions... So, here's the thing - I have been legitimately diagnosed with BPD & ADHD. I'm here, essentially, to ask if the combination of those comorbid illnesses causes these symptoms I experience or if I could be experiencing symptoms of undiagnosed OCD.   


I become, well, obsessed with how likely it is that the people I know, may know people from my past who saw the darkest parts of my mind and soul and no longer talk to me because I don't want this to happen, and I feel that if it does happen, something catastrophic will occur in my life as a result. I keep myself awake until I can make sure that none of them have mutual friends with me across any social medias, and sometimes I have to check some of them multiple times. This can take me a long time, because there are five of them.   


Sometimes, if I connect with someone on omegle who has one of my interests that I didn't share with any of my ""old friends"" and an interest I DID, too, I feel like something is going to happen and I have to connect three to five times with someone who has neither of those topics in common with me, and sometimes I have to do multiple sets of three tries because even though I completed it, it felt off, still.   


I believe that I was a specific, notorious murderer in my past life and that I chose my mother's womb because she is a healer who could bring me back into a state of lightness, and that I was evil until I discovered this fact in my twenties.   


I sometimes, in the middle of completing a task, have the thought that if I don't finish before a certain point in a song, or sometimes before my trash can closes (it's the kind that slowly closes so it doesn't make a loud sound), etc, something bad will happen .   


I had never thought of OCD as a potential diagnosis, because I thought of the very basic, stigmatized sort of stereotype in film and television, and when I was telling someone (a friend) about some of these traits of mine, she asked me if I had OCD, so now it has me thinking.

thxvt2,"I don‚Äôt see any other way this story ends besides my death hi everyone,

I‚Äôm in a very bad place.

I‚Äôve been suffering from POCD, contamination OCD and groinal responses for a few years now. 

A year and a half ago I was doing very badly, but since this past summer I worked on stuff such as exercising regularly and eating well and doing hobbies I enjoyed and I felt like I was in a very good place and felt like I could live with my OCD. 

Then, this past January, my long term girlfriend cheated on me while on study abroad and because of that I chose to break up with her. We had been together for nearly 4 years. 

Very shortly after that I tried hooking up with this girl but when we got down to it I couldn‚Äôt get an erection. 

I‚Äôve talked with my ex a few times since we broke up and she‚Äôs been with other guys. 

I‚Äôve returned to therapy after not having gone for a couple years to deal with all of this. 

This past week I went on spring break and was quite excited for the change of pace. I thought it might make me feel better. And while it was fun and the weather was warm I was doing very badly mentally. 

This is all just too much. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm strong enough to do this. While my ex was not my therapist I think I‚Äôm realizing how much support she provided me. 

I literally cannot get out of my head. I cannot stop thinking about her, thinking of her with others guys and how I can‚Äôt sleep with anyone. 

I think the groinal responses may have given me pelvic floor dysfunction. I know there is something wrong with my body physically. It doesn‚Äôt feel right. 

I feel like the relationship gave me validation that despite my issues I was still attractive. 

Now I feel like a loser or that I‚Äôm sad or pathetic or that I‚Äôm a creep. What if I was always these things and I just deluded myself? 

What if I can never have sex with someone ever again? Who‚Äôs gonna want some weirdo with my issues that can‚Äôt even have sex with them? What if my ex is the only woman I can ever have sex with? What if she‚Äôs the only woman I‚Äôm attracted to? What if I‚Äôm not attracted to women at all?

I feel nervous and uncomfortable all of the time. I cannot relax. How can I be with a woman this way? 

I want to be back with my ex so badly, but she seemingly doesn‚Äôt want to. I need her. I don‚Äôt want anyone else. 

It‚Äôs all just too much. I have had very strong desires to kill myself this week. It‚Äôs just all too overwhelming. 

I just want to not exist. I just want the world to pause. I feel like my life is passing me by. I feel like time is going by too fast. Why do I have to be this way?

Although it is a very dangerous thing that will mostly just cause you negative feelings and will make it much harder for you to be happy and free. It's not easy loosing somebody in that role because we really don't have very many at one time. You must not cling onto the feeling of it even though it may seem like the only way she can remain in your life. She always will live in your past and you may always have love for her deep down which you should if the feelings were genuine. But you need to let go of your claim on her. She is not a part of your future in the same way as in your past and that was your decision as well as hers. It's not easy and it may take some time but it's very possible. You don't need her to be happy. Those feelings you felt with her that you remember are not gone forever. Maybe The way you remember them are coming from her so that's how you think they have to happen but you can feel them in other ways. After that you can be free and do things that you want to do (even though now it may not seem like there's much you want to do but there will be many things once your mind is clear). You will be able to direct those feelings of love toward yourself as well instead. There are so many people in the world man, all beautiful in their own way including you and i can see you sound like a very caring person who is intelligent too. There are people who would love to be with you emotionally and intimately. Although the road you are going down with your thoughts will make it more difficult to meet people. Which will validate the OCD that you just can't find somebody personally. There's nothing about you that is unloveable. You should learn that. You are not any less coming out of this situation. Don't let it make you think that. Keep your head up! Maybe do some research on relationship psychology as well as continue to research your own OCD. Do not compare yourself to her either whatever she's doing now really doesn't matter in relation to you. You are your own person. Moving at your own pace and that's good. ### Please do not do anything to hurt yourself. You are loved, Jesus loves you. I don‚Äôt really know how to help you so much navigating this. I can‚Äôt tell your brain to stop thinking these things, and i‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre feeling like this and going through this. Your worth more than your attractiveness and sex, don‚Äôt let your life be ruined by such things. Maybe you are attractive, maybe you‚Äôre not and that‚Äôs ok. Maybe you won‚Äôt have a sexual relationship ever again or maybe you‚Äôll find another woman who loves you who can be sexually intimate or not with you. Life‚Äôs not over. Try to go back and do some things you enjoy, i love you and Jesus loves you. ### I don‚Äôt want to die. but it‚Äôs just all too much.

I don‚Äôt believe in God but thank you for the sentiment. 

But no, I need to find someone. Not to make me feel better about my OCD but I can‚Äôt be alone forever. I want be able to have sex with someone. I want to be normal. ### If you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please do not hesitate to talk to someone. The wonderful u/froidinslip has

ti89t4,"Relationship OCD Intrusive Thoughts Hi folks, 

This post is to remind people they are not alone and to allow me to get things off my chest. 

Recently, I have had an extreme OCD flare up at the same time I have started a relationship with a long-time friend. Our time together has been really great and I have begun to experience partner-focused intrusive thoughts around  things like intelligence differences and our compatibility. These thoughts are not even grounded in anything specifically, are random, and have even been insulting and constant. I don't know how this started or where it came from, but I know I wouldn't be having these thoughts or paying them any attention if I didn't have OCD - which is key. Fortunately, I have such a supportive partner that I could even talk about these things with her and she would probably still love and accept me. 

If you have had thoughts/doubts about your partner and their real or imagined flaws - you are not alone. Stick with it and try to interact with your partner as you always would. It won't take long to see why you love them/care for them. If your relationship is new like mine - allow yourself some time to continue to learn and grow with your partner. Ignore the temptation to push them away or end things. ROCD will ruin everything that comes to you, if you let it. Be brave and stick it out. Know that things will probably disipate and become clear eventually. Think about the fact that you are probably with your partner for a pretty good reason (or many). Think about how they make you feel and have always felt. That's really all that matters. 

DM me if you need help/support.",0,2022-03-19 19:53:06-04:00,,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/ti89t4/relationship_ocd_intrusive_thoughts/
thyfmf,"What if your fear can't be disproven through ERP? I've read and heard many experts talk about how ERP can help you by showing your brain that the thing you feared doesn't come true when you resist your compulsions. My problem with that is that my fear (a ""real event"") isn't and really can't be disproven. I may have harmed people, if I did I don't know how many, I don't know who, and I have no way of figuring it out! And even if I did have all that information, I still couldn't be certain. My mind would still say, ""Well, maybe they'll develop some health problem later that the doctors can't detect now!""  


So when I sit with my uncertainty and anxiety, my mind doesn't get to see that the fear was irrational because the ""bad thing"" didn't happen.  


I'm curious if this matters. Will ERP not be as effective? Is there something else I should do or some other way of thinking about this?¬†",8,2022-03-19 12:08:18-04:00,"I don‚Äôt think the point of ERP is to disprove your fears, but rather to teach you how to live with them. 

Maybe you hurt people, maybe you didn‚Äôt. Like you said, you have no way of knowing for sure and there will always be uncertainty. So, with that in mind, what‚Äôs the point of worrying? If you‚Äôll never know for sure, why waste time ruminating about it and looking for a conclusive answer? I realize this is waaaaay easier said than done, but that‚Äôs the basic idea of ERP.  Accept the uncertainty and learn to live with it. As you expose yourself to the fear, sit with the anxiety and allow the thoughts to pass unchallenged. You can acknowledge them and the anxiety they cause, but don‚Äôt fight. You can say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm thinking about x and it‚Äôs making me anxious‚Äù or ‚Äúmaybe the thoughts are right, maybe they‚Äôre wrong‚Äù, but don‚Äôt try and disprove them or make them go away. Just acknowledge them and carry on with your day. 

You CAN cope with the uncertainty. You CAN sit there and allow the thoughts to go unchallenged. You CAN withstand the anxiety they cause. Uncertainty won‚Äôt kill you and the anxiety won‚Äôt either. Once you prove that to yourself and retrain your brain to understand that, the anxiety will lessen overtime. I‚Äôve been practicing this for a while now and I still have bad days, yes, but I have a lot of good days too. It‚Äôs very scary to let go and it‚Äôs really REALLY hard at the beginning, but, in my experience, the more you stick with it, the easier it becomes. ### I've had this issue as well. There are people who have obsessions like counting things or else someone will die, rooted in magical thinking. I'm sure this is very stressful to them but it seems more treatable than obsessions over fires, health events, car crashes, etc

I've heard the idea is just exposure to and acceptance of the thoughts and the uncertainty in life, and just letting them pass rather than grasping onto them and trying to parse out if they really will happen. I endlessly research my fears. ### I know some people say it really helps, and that‚Äôs great, but ERP seems like a treatment that‚Äôs tantamount to giving up on finding something that actually helps.  We don‚Äôt want to manage this shit and deal with feeling terrible‚Ä¶‚Ä¶we want it gone.  In what other disease is the gold standard treatment ‚Äòjust learn to live with it‚Äô.  Please scientists‚Ä¶.find some better drugs!  Or actual treatments. ### As you‚Äôve gotten into your erp, did you have your ocd fight back, hitting you with lots of different thoughts and guilt?

Ive had a few periods (hours) when I‚Äôve felt ok or even joy, and when I realize that I immediately feel guilty, like I need to think about my intrusive thoughts again to make sure it‚Äôs okay for me to feel good. ### If you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please do not hesitate to talk to someone.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/OCD) if you have any questions or concerns.* ### As great as that would be, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs possible to create a drug or treatment that will ensure that you never experience an uncomfortable thought ever again. You can‚Äôt control your thoughts, but you can control your response to them. While things like ERP and CBT don‚Äôt and can‚Äôt remove the thoughts, they can significantly decrease the anxiety that they provoke. They‚Äôre certainly not a utopian cure all, but since that‚Äôs never going to exist, they‚Äôre the best thing we‚Äôve got. ### Yes. As soon as the anxiety started to subside a bit, I was bombarded with new thoughts that asked, ‚ÄúWhat if you‚Äôre not anxious because you like/agree with the thoughts?‚Äù This is a trick and it‚Äôs super common among people in recovery. In a twisted way, the anxiety itself becomes a form of checking/reassurance seeking. In other words: a compulsion. You want to feel anxious in order to prove that the thoughts must be untrue because they‚Äôre unwanted. It‚Äôs very tempting, but don‚Äôt give into it. We can‚Äôt control our thoughts, but we can control the meaning we ascribe to them. I read something somewhere that said, on average, we have around 50,000 thoughts per day. Some are going to be pleasant, others unpleasant, but, at the end of the day, they‚Äôre all just thoughts. When you think about it, there‚Äôs actually no difference between regular thoughts and intrusive thoughts. They‚Äôre the same thing, but we tell ourselves that they‚Äôre different because we CHOSE to ascribe different meanings to them. 

In conjunction with the exposures, I‚Äôve also started doing something called ‚Äúmental noting‚Äù. Mental noting is a meditation where you label ANY mental activity that distracts you from your anchor (mine is breathing). So, for example, if I am meditating and I notice that a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù thought or an ‚Äúintrusive‚Äù thought are distracting me from focusing on my breathing, I say to myself, ‚Äúthinking,‚Äù and then return to watching my breath. By labeling both normal and intrusive thoughts as ‚Äúthinking‚Äù, I subtly remind myself that they‚Äôre the same. I don‚Äôt need to engage with every intrusive thought that comes into my head. Instead, I can treat them the same way I‚Äôd treat any other thought: by acknowledging it and moving on. 

Again, all this is easier said than done, but it can be done. ### I get what you‚Äôre saying, I do, but horrible OCD loops are a lot more than an uncomfortable thought.  I‚Äôve had periods of almost complete remission from OCD where I was left with some anxiety.  CBT helps with that, but IMO, for me, it‚Äôs not great at handling OCD.  It feels like a band-aid.  I know there are lots of mental illnesses and none of them have great treatments, but what if we told schizophrenics to ‚Äòsay no‚Äô to their delusions.  I know the comparison is a stretch, but that‚Äôs sometimes how it feels. ### ",5,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/thyfmf/what_if_your_fear_cant_be_disproven_through_erp/

thgsl7,"i'm fed up, no more of this! i had an epiphany last night. nothing that my ocd has ever told me will happen has ever happened. nothing i have ever feared due to my ocd has ever, ever been true. this is extremely consistent. 

so now i guess the next step is to remind myself of this next time i get worried about something terrible happening. its hard; even with this realization, im still afraid and thinking of all of the ways its ""different this time.""

no more of this. im going to ignore it as best i can. it has never been right before, so why would it be right this time?",15,2022-03-18 18:23:23-04:00,"The only truth about OCD is that it always lies. ### It‚Äôs so tough getting out of your own head but we got this!!! ### Bless those moments of clarity.   
I have been struggling with severe OCD since early childhood, and I felt so liberated the moment I realized that my OCD does not actually result in apocalyptic outcomes if I don't do exactly what it tells me to do. 

I hope that you start to find more peace because of your new perspective. I definitely know it's helped me in huge ways. ### Thanks for this. I will use this tactic also. ### This made me tear up a bit. I was just thinking about how awful I am and how I must do a million things to become better. Thank you :) ### They‚Äôve actually researched this!! I can‚Äôt remember the exact study, but I remember reading one about ‚Äúextreme worriers‚Äù and whether or not the things they worried about came to pass.

Over 90% never happened. And the few that did happen, most had much better outcomes than expected. 

Something that has helped me has been recognizing the ‚Äúmagical thinking‚Äù involved with my OCD. Like, questioning WHY my brain thinks this time it will be different or why it‚Äôs true for me and no one else. The more I question it, the more absurd it gets ‚Äî is it REALLY more likely just because I had the thought? That‚Äôs never been the case before! So why would it be true this time? ### In OCD ERP therapy I learned that OCD is a bully.  And the best way to beat it is to beat it at its own game.. ""You are right OCD, I am a horrible person and this will happen (insert theme here). Doing this takes the power away and will begin to desensitize that theme. ### Very true! ### you can't control your thoughts because they're not a part of you, you can however control how you respond to them. Think of it this way, you're at a park sitting on a bench just people watching on a beautiful sunny day, every person that's there is an intrusive thought, you can't control how those people behave because they're not a part of you, the only thing you can do is acknowledge them as they walk by, while enjoying the fresh air and sunny day. ### My OCD has caused me all kinds of hell in real life, it‚Äôs like a demon manifesting itself. Hate it, if it was a person I‚Äôd do anything to kill it but ofcourse is doesn‚Äôt work like that ### I totally agree with you. All this OCD anxiety is stupid and makes no sense. It is hard to ignore it, but it's the only way to get rid of this horrible disorder. Be strong! We all will be fine :) ### What would you rather be doing than participating with obsessions via compulsions? 

Do that when the obsessions are blaring. Your brain will eventually catch on and throw you less. ### Call OCD on it's bullshit, rather than blindly following it's instructions and I notice it starts to bother you less, like you offended it lol. Occasionally it'll see if it can still scam you, but the less you fall for it's shit the less it will bother you. I'm prone to superstitious thinking, OCD loves that. Being logical kills it. ### This needs to be an affirmation sticker or something. -powerful statement. ### Haha, thanks. ### ",99,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/thgsl7/im_fed_up_no_more_of_this/

I don‚Äôt really expect anyone to read this, and that‚Äôs okay. I guess I just want to get my feelings out there, as I haven‚Äôt been talking to anyone about this at all.

OCD is really starting to win the battle. I can‚Äôt do it anymore. I try to ignore the thoughts but I can‚Äôt. It feels like I give in and do compulsions against my own will. I haven‚Äôt been able to sleep at night because these thoughts haunt me all night. I can only sleep during the day, and even then it takes me hours to finally fall asleep for a while. 

I‚Äôm a high school student and I‚Äôve fallen really behind because of my OCD. I haven‚Äôt done any schoolwork in a month and that‚Äôs not an exaggeration. I am literally failing every single class. 

OCD has made me become suicidal. I don‚Äôt want to die I just want to stop suffering, but sometimes it feels like the only way I can ever stop suffering is if I wasn‚Äôt alive anymore.

I‚Äôve tried asking my mom to take me to a psychiatrist or therapist but she says she will and she reaches out to doctors via email but apparently she doesn‚Äôt get any responses. It‚Äôs been like this for a long time.

And it‚Äôs more than possible to have OCD and struggle with it, and also live a great and full and happy life. Those two things are possible to hold in the balance, as crazy as it sounds. And I look back on that 13 year old kid and it breaks my heart. I wish I could tell her that no matter how endless it feels‚Ä¶it isn‚Äôt. I promise. The terrible thing about OCD is it‚Äôs the doubting disease‚Äîit makes you doubt anything outside of it. So it takes a leap of faith to choose Hope, but choose it‚Äîyou‚Äôre worth it. Talk to somebody‚Äîif you‚Äôre able to tell your mom how serious this really is, do it. Is there a school counselor or someone you can talk to there? Do it. If a hotline is the only resource available, then do it‚Äîwhatever it takes, whatever steps, however imperfect they are, towards Hope‚Äîtake them. Keep taking them.

It is really the best and the only way to fight with OCD. And then I want to tell you about one thing really helped me: I just realized, that OCD is not me, I don't wanna do all these endless rituals. I just want to stop it! OCD is just your brain is trying to calm the anxiety inside you and then all compulsions appear. Earlier I tried to fight with compulsions, but it makes no sense. You should understand, that it's just your anxiety.  Try to understand that there is no point in all these rituals. There is no need to check, repeat and do something again, it's just your brain trying to protect you from stupid and imaginary threats. This understanding helped me a lot, but I am not sure, if I explained all this well. It is really hard to explain. Be strong!

I‚Äôm a 20y/F and haven‚Äôt been in a relationship but I‚Äôm curious, do people in relationships tell their partners about an obsession that they can‚Äôt get out of their heads? I can‚Äôt imagine being in a relationship and not mentioning one that‚Äôs really stressing me out that day but I also don‚Äôt want to stress someone else out/cause them any kind of sadness and end up pushing them away because of that stress. I feel like recently it‚Äôs been a huge reason as to why I don‚Äôt feel ready for relationships, but at the same time I‚Äôm worried that this is just the way it is and I also don‚Äôt want to isolate myself because that‚Äôs not ideal either. 

Basically are my options to either:

1) Be in a relationship where I‚Äôm not saying a lot to make sure I don‚Äôt cause my partner any distress but in turn not be able to feel fully comfortable with the person.

2) Be in a relationship where I‚Äôm possibly causing someone else distress and I imagine this ends up crashing down.

I do sometimes wish that I end up with someone who also has OCD because I‚Äôm sure that would help in regard to them being able to understand what I‚Äôm going through more. The thing is, I‚Äôm ethnic (born and raised in a western country) but the whole topic of mental health is very taboo in my culture. Not to say I‚Äôd only be with someone from my culture, but it‚Äôs just one of those things where it adds another layer of stress because if I were to be in a relationship with someone from the same culture there‚Äôs a high chance they wouldn‚Äôt be able to understand it. Of course that doesn‚Äôt always apply and I hope that changes, but its just an observation I‚Äôve noticed from some close friends I‚Äôve told.

I don‚Äôt know if this even makes sense but yes:‚Äô)",2,2022-03-19 17:29:26-04:00,"Hi!
Personally I do share some of my obsessive thoughts with my partner. However, I think what you share with an S/O is a lot to do with how You view your OCD and obsessions. For me, whether I do or don't talk about something depends on my own feelings of shame/anxiety/frustration and how 'acceptable' I class those as, probably a lot more than how I think my partner will react.
However! I do have a very supportive partner so that is a huge thing in this equation.
Being able to talk to your partner about your issues is a matter of trust on either end. You having faith in them to react in a compassionate way, for example. 


It's probably also important to consider what your expectations would be if you did share that information - so that you can consider if a person you are dating/are considering dating is someone who is likely to offer that or be receptive to a request for that kind of support. I.e. if you would want someone to talk to you about it, or just to listen, would you expect your partner to handle any tasks that are very difficult for you due to OCD or at least be open to negotiations for chores? And of course they'd have to believe that you are struggling/not overlook it in the first place!

But about your options ...

It's absolutely possible for you to have a relationship where you share the negatives of your life candidly and in a way that serves your needs, without hurting the other person. There is a middle ground - it isn't just suffer in silence, or make someone else suffer. In any relationship there has to be room for both people, and that includes their struggles.


While your partner can't reasonably be your stand in therapist and there will always be limits on what they can do, if you have a good line of communication with them they will be able to tell you when they don't feel available for deep conversations about sensitive topics, when they Do feel ready to talk about those things, when they need a moment to collect their thoughts, when they need something from you... You should both be able to listen to each other and respect each others needs and boundaries.


If someone isn't there for you about your OCD at all, or isn't there for you about your pain and struggles in any facet of your life, they're probably not worth your time. Your partner is someone there through the ups and downs, and if they expect you to be on a constant up (or to keep quiet when you are struggling) that's a huge red flag imo.


Edit: not sure how coherent this is as I'm a bit sleepy but I hope it helps answer your question a little bit at least ### Hey! That‚Äôs so good you have a very supportive partner that you can share with! Honestly I think it‚Äôs just someone who can listen and possibly even give some reassurance. I wouldn‚Äôt expect them to do chores I struggle with but I just imagine having a partner that‚Äôs more understanding would maybe help in terms of helping me with stuff that I struggle with at times. I imagine it would be hard to navigate that in terms of figuring out what‚Äôs too much!

Why does it makes it worse in the first place? I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs something related to our self control being relaxed? Like we are not there to be fully aware and try to stop them‚Ä¶ ? Any input would be appreciated. Thanks. Xoxo",29,2022-03-19 02:56:40-04:00,"Weed has actually helped me a lot with my ocd. Because it makes me see things differently I challenge my intrusive thoughts and find reasons against them and it doesn‚Äôt trigger me because I‚Äôm so relaxed ### Sativa makes me have nonstop panic attacks until I come down because I feel out of control. Indica makes me fall asleep before I can feel anything, but I also don‚Äôt like the way it makes me feel. I‚Äôve had to accept that weed just is not my drug.

This is NOT medical advice and I don‚Äôt advise doing it because YMMV and also in most places they‚Äôre illegal (I‚Äôve only tried them in situations where personal use amounts were legal) just a personal anecdote but psychedelics make my OCD completely go away while I‚Äôm on them. I don‚Äôt use them for that though, it‚Äôs just a weird thing I‚Äôve noticed. If I‚Äôm on psychs I literally don‚Äôt care about Anything I usually do OCD related. And when I come down I remember the things I did that would usually be a problem but I still just don‚Äôt care because, well, it worked out fine.

Nothing else I‚Äôve tried (mostly just SSRIs) has done a thing for me. I mostly tend to just stick to high amounts of stimulants because I also have suspected mild narcolepsy (highly comorbid with another disorder I have) that makes my life really inconvenient if I don‚Äôt carefully control it with stimulants. ### To be completely honest, I just quit weed because it made my OCD worse and no particular strain could fix it. When using, it would calm thoughts down, but at the moment the paranoia would kick in my mind would go crazy. 

For me the drug I took that had the ""best"" effect on OCD was xtc, since my mind was on a completely other level. The absolute worst was ketamine because I felt trapped not being able to do rituals to calm myself down. ### Honestly I‚Äôve never thought about it until now - but my OCD has been WAY better since I started smoking. Crazy that I never noticed. It‚Äôs still there but I only have a few rituals and they‚Äôre pretty low-stakes. ### Weed will definitely make it worse. But I can recommend taking CBD pills or other CBD products. Works like a charm, it's usually subtle. I'm currently taking pills that contain 8.3mg of CBD each, and I can take 2 a day. It's helped.

But I can't deal with THC. Makes me all shaky, agitated, and I get stuck on thoughts like I'm chained to a merry-go-round. ### My dear, google ""Mushrooms and OCD"" ### Yeah.... sigh. I experienced the same thing tonite. Maybe our intrusive thoughts were amplified by the weed? That seems pretty likely... I mean usually it helps but brain chemistry and all that :( ### It didn‚Äôt have any effect on my ocd. But i also suffer from crohn‚Äô diseases so smoking for me is a big nooo. ### I've noticed that hybrids work best for me. I've also got some CBD seltzer water to curb the paranoia if it builds up. I haven't quite decided fully if smoking makes it worse as I have only recently discovered that my intrusive thoughts are actually OCD, but I am noticing that I am attaching myself to the thoughts less; however, I can Definitely understand it making it worse depending on the strain. I smoked a heavy indica last night and got anxious, but thankfully I had that CBD seltzer and it calmed me back down. Hope you can find a strain, or that you figure out another alternative! ### One thing I noticed was that in order to really get help from cannabis for anxiety, I needed to eat it and not smoke it. It doesn‚Äôt really matter what form I eat it in - an edible, distillate, RSO - it just needed to go through my stomach in order to give me relief. 

I ended up learning that when cannabis is eaten, it undergoes another reaction in your body and becomes a form of THC called THC-11 (I think? I‚Äôm no expert). In any case, this metabolized form of THC is more sedating than the initial form of THC that gets released and has a much stronger calming effect. It feels similar to taking an antihistamine. If you‚Äôve been smoking maybe try edibles out and see if you have a better time? ### This definitely depends on the person. It works sometimes, but other times, it makes it really bad. I would recommend trying it and see where it goes. ### Weed made mine out of control. ### Weed made my ocd worse I swore I‚Äôd never touch that again. ### I often find that weed both aggravates my ocd and hyper-increases my creativity. So I use weed when I‚Äôm listening to music and want to dance (i dance 10x better when high) or when i‚Äôm watching a movie with lots of metaphors or when I‚Äôm writing. Focusing on something takes away the constant intrusive thoughts or paranoia from the thoughts. It actually helps my OCD be more productive. Indica is a more calm high for me, sativa is a more hyper high. ### it makes mine extremely worse ### Same here, oddly enough sativas seem to help me a bit more. I can logic it out and offer more empathy to myself. I always let my therapist know when I‚Äôm high in session tho ### you dont have to answer this if you dont want, but was the ketamine recreational or medical? im asking because i just signed up for ketamine infusions which are supposed to help ocd ### i wouldn‚Äôt say ‚Äúdefinitely‚Äù 

weed has helped a lot with my OCD, it is the best anti-anxiety medicine i‚Äôve ever had. i‚Äôm a multi-daily smoker and am thankful for its impact on my life ### That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm experiencing right now. And it has happened pretty much the last 3 times I have smoked this strain, but it‚Äôs the only one I have to unwind right now. Most of my compulsions are related to the bathroom. Like just now I was getting ready to bed and I had to splash my face more than 15 times when normally I feel ‚Äúright‚Äù by the 6th time. It makes the ones I have worse and also makes me create new ones. Freaking sucks because I don‚Äôt want to give up weed just because of my OCD. ### Isn‚Äôt smoking weed good for chrohns? My friend smokes all of the time for his Chrohns ### It was recreational and I was pretty drunk at the time. I can trust that it could be used medically since me experience wasn't in good conditions or with an appropriate mindset for it. Another part of me during that was really relaxed, so I think it could work. ### Well, then it works for you. I meant definitely in terms of OP's experience because they said they think it's making their OCD worse ### Oh yikes.... I really hope you are able to calm down! I was drinking some herbal tea trying to relax... anxiety is a bitch.

Damn. Honestly I was there too and I‚Äôm going to get on some medication. Not sure if you are but when I was on SSRIs life was much better.

Sorry to hear about your compulsions. I guess mine is endless reassurance... ### Smoking have some benefits for rectocolitis (could reduce the inflammation) still not recommended (causing lungs ‚Ä¶ cancer) but not for crohn. ( increase inflammation) ### thanks for your reply! ### I don't know where to get that shit üò© ### I‚Äôm not on meds. I was once prescribed antidepressants for treating my migraines but after a couple of months they started to make me feel detached from reality and I stopped taking them. Have been scared ever since then. 

Did you have any weird side effects when taking them? ### No problem! I hope it helps in any way shape or form. ### Oh yikes. Also I have a fear of going crazy and I think a lot of anxiety sufferers do.. ### ",11,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/thpmyz/weed_for_ocd/
ti2wzv,"A Doctor Rant So last Thursday I took a blood test for some issues and I called about getting the results 2 days ago because it had been a full week since the test. The receptionist said that the results are in and I would receive a call shortly. It never came that day, which was fine. Cut to yesterday and after a long day at work I still did not hear back so I check my portal and there they are published in all their glory. I called the office, and they said my doctor was no longer in and couldn‚Äôt read them until Monday. So I went on a Google searching spree for 4 hours just stuck in a thought loop trying to interpret the results. I found some really scary and triggering things. I had told my doctor that I had OCD before the test but it was like it wasn‚Äôt super important to her. 

Why can‚Äôt OCD be taken seriously and not stereotyped so heavily? It‚Äôs like my voice is never really heard. The only people who 100% get it are the people who have it.

thsth3,"Advise needed - UK Hello, using a throwaway account as I am a long time reddit lurker.

For the past few months, I have always gone through the same routine when I leave my flat for the day where I have to check every little thing. This includes things like:

\> Making sure the oven is off, even if I haven't used it

\> Checking the fridge/freezer to make sure its closed, even if I haven't got anything out of there

\> Checking all windows to make sure they are closed, even if I haven't touched them recently

\> Checking all taps to make sure they are off, even if I haven't used them recently

\> Making sure everything is unplugged from the wall sockets

\> Locking my front door, walking away and then coming back to make sure it is actually locked

Recently, I have realised that when I go through this routine, I have been checking these things more and more before I leave the flat. A month/few weeks ago, I may have checked everything 2-3 times, however, today, I must have obsessively checked everything 6-7 times and I literally found that I physically couldn't leave the building. After spending an hour checking everything, I thought I was ready to leave and locked my front door and walked away, however, I found myself coming back as I was worried that I hadn't locked the door, unlocking it, locking it again and repeating this again and again until I got myself into a complete mess and just broke down sobbing and dry heaving and my heart felt like it was going to explode. I ended up cancelling my plans and I just feel so fucking embarrassed and useless.

The best way I can explain it is when I check something (EG: Making sure the taps are off), I can visually see theres no water coming out of the tap, I tell myself theres no water coming out of the tap but in my head, its like neither one of registering in my brain and I have to check again and again.

I also find that when I'm trying to read anything (Emails, newspaper etc), its like my brain just glosses over everything and it feels like I have to physically force myself to pay attention to all the words for my brain to actually process what I'm seeing.

I've also noticed that I have developed an sense of constant worry and uneasiness where I am always worried something bad is going to happen. Again, going back to the taps, theres always a thought in my head that I've left one on and its going to flood the flat despite the fact I can SEE that theres nothing coming out of them.

Todays the first time where I found that I physically couldn't leave the flat because of this and I know that if I don't acknowledge that I have an issue and try and do something about it, its going to get worse and worse and end up crippling my life.

I was wondering what the best course of action would be to start addressing this issue. Is it best if I make an appointment with my GP via the NHS to discuss this with them?",7,2022-03-19 06:58:15-04:00,"It would definitely be worth it to start treatment for OCD, it gets difficult but you have to remember that your recovery depends on your action ultimately. I've been in treatment for around a year almost and still am working on starting to consistently practice ERP, it's been difficult but it's definitely made an improvement in how much OCD affects me to be in therapy, and even though I don't have frequent sessions it still helps me to notice changes and improvements in how I've been responding to OCD that I may have overlooked when I'm updating my therapist on how I've been doing. ### Wow I relate to a lot you‚Äôve said very much, just on a slightly less severe basis. I haven‚Äôt been diagnosed with OCD but I‚Äôm certain it must be this. I have yet to do anything about it for myself but seeing as yours sounds pretty extreme I really hope you manage to get it sorted soon and can live your life happily ‚ù§Ô∏è ### Yes, this sounds like it‚Äôs probably OCD and is severely interfering with normal functioning. Your GP should be your first point of call - they‚Äôll be able to discuss medication options, and also tell you about therapy options available on the NHS. You‚Äôll probably have to self refer to IAPT, but at least your GP can explain the process and provide support. 

Best of luck, I hope you get the help you need and feel better soon :) ### I think it would be extremely helpful to begin to take some action in starting treatment for OCD, I've been in therapy since last spring and only recently in the past few months began doing ERP (Exposure Response Prevention) to treat my OCD and recently saw a nurse practitioner who specializes in OCD for medication management and it has been helpful to have some actual resources for treatment in place. ### I agree I need to start soon yeah, I‚Äôve just been leaving it a while as I‚Äôm currently getting therapy for body dysmorphic disorder and am going through some regular ERP exercises with that so I‚Äôve avoided being overwhelmed too much. Thank you for your message though and I will definitely endeavour to do something about it ASAP! :) ### Of course.

I know that people have all done bad, and most people feel guilt over doing bad things, but it's not realistic to have constant intrusive thoughts over them. I'm not afraid of going to hell or anything like that, but at my core, being a ""bad or mean"" person is difficult for me to process. I know that a few bad things I've done is not indicative of my entire personality or my relationship with every person. However, I can't undo bad things I've done both on purpose or on accident.",24,2022-03-18 18:01:54-04:00,"I think it starts with acknowledging that you can‚Äôt change the past.  The more you accept that and accept that today is your baseline, the easier it is to plan to move forward.   From there, you just have to make plans to improve instead of spending the time worrying.  Then when the bad thoughts come you can say yes, but I am doing x y z to address that. ### OCD loves to attach itself to past mistakes/transgressions that challenges our morality. it‚Äôs one thing to admit or own up to a mistake. Self reflection is not a bad thing. However if you learned what you did was ‚Äúimmoral‚Äù or ‚Äúbad‚Äù, you feel guilty and changed your behavior then you have to remind yourself that. Good people learn and change. We are human ### I would try to move away from thinking people are good or bad. Actions can help or harm people and everyone takes both actions through their life. ### We are all only human. Humans have a great capacity for kindness, compassion, patience, generosity, forgiveness, empathy, and self improvement. We also have an equal capacity (in many ways) for the opposite- I.e. greed, malice, prejudice, willing ignorance, violence, apathy, and evil in general. Being a human means making an effort everyday to act in accordance with our inherent ‚Äúgoodness‚Äù, while also witnessing our neighbors repeatedly, (sometimes knowingly) indulging the worst parts of their humanity. You can‚Äôt just logic your way out of the bitterness and anger that you feel watching others behave badly, and sometimes you find yourself letting some of that leak out, even though you know it‚Äôs wrong, or even though you think there is some morally superior option that you intentionally ignored. 
It is the nature of humanity, the two wolves within us. We try to only feed the good wolf, but sometimes the bad wolf sweet-talks his counterpart into throwing him a bone. Trying your best, chasing the elusive, indefinable beacon of ‚Äúmorality‚Äù, means doing what you can, and when you let yourself down, take a moment to reflect on the beauty and complexity of humanity, and how interesting it is to exist as a human. ### I guess the question is, how long will you torture yourself for past mistakes? ### This is a good post. ### Read a book called 'They Myth of Self Esteem' by Albert Ellis. He argues for adopting unconditional self acceptance and how to achieve this. Changed my life. ### i really relate to this one. I think of it this way, we all do bad things, and no amount of obsessing over our past actions will provide any relief, it only amplifies guilt and anxiety,, which helps no one and makes it harder to grow. If you fear being a bad person, chances are you aren‚Äôt one, and even if you‚Äôve been really shitty, all you can possibly do is learn, move forward, and forgive yourself. Easier said then done, I know. it‚Äôs been really tough but i find it helpful to recognize that the intrusive guilt isn‚Äôt actually even about each specific action. My OCD causes me to feel guilty and my brain provides something to project that guilt onto, even if it was years ago. Therefore, replaying it over and over in my head won‚Äôt solve anything, i‚Äôll make myself feel better, reassure myself that i don‚Äôt have to feel horrible anymore, and it‚Äôll still come back full force, because it‚Äôs not logical, it‚Äôs just OCD. the guilt you feel isnt because you deserve to feel it. you‚Äôre a good person ### We‚Äôre all human. To be human is to be sometimes moral and sometimes immoral. Anything else would be inhuman! ### May he throw the first stone he who never sinned.

Basically, as an atheist, only God can judge you.

Like, every single person has done bad things on purpose and on accident.


I speak as someone with morality OCD who‚Äôs still recovering and trying to figure it out as I go. ### From what I‚Äôve learned about ERP, it‚Äôs more about treating the anxiety we have instead of correcting our thoughts on something. Whether or not our obsessions are based in reality, they‚Äôre still obsessions, which cause us a lot more grief than we need.

What helps me is when my girlfriend helps me through an exposure. When she, the nicest person I know, tells me ‚ÄúYes, you‚Äôre terrible. Awful for even thinking that.‚Äù At first it was hard not to believe her, but now I can see how ridiculous it is when she says it. That style works for me. ### Thank you for sharing this! I‚Äôve struggled with this forever and to the point where I‚Äôve contemplated suicide and even a fear of only being remembered for the crappy things I‚Äôve done. It‚Äôs a toughy but I have good days and bad days and I realize that I‚Äôll never make those mistakes again and that im human and not perfect and am a much better person now it‚Äôs just hard to be present sometimes and not to disassociate and fall into the mind traps but it‚Äôs worth sticking around and healing from it ‚ù§Ô∏è we live in a world of labels but it only matters how we talk to ourselves at the end of the day. It‚Äôs really hard.. but it must get better. Thank you for posting this üëç ### I too struggle severely with morality ocd. The most importance thing that helped me is remembering we are ALL sinners.

Some Christians might say that god‚Äôs forgiveness/love is conditional on you believing in him, but it‚Äôs not. God is telling us that his forgiveness and love is within each and every one of us. ### Really the only thing you can do is compare yourself to you from yesterday.

th3vxa,So this is pretty wild and kinda fucked (I‚Äôll be in detail) So I masturbating last night to pictures of my gf and I was just scrolling and a picture of her cat and her came up and I was still going at it and now my head keeps telling me I‚Äôm attracted to cats and it disgusts me so much can I stop this will it go away it‚Äôs draining me it‚Äôs so bad I‚Äôve had thoughts before that have drained me but,32,2022-03-18 11:25:31-04:00,"You're not attracted to cats. What it sounds like happened is that you were already really aroused and turned on by looking at pictures of your girlfriend, so when the picture of her cat randomly popped up, you still had those feelings of arousal while seeing the cat because you were already aroused. Your arousal had nothing to do with the cat, but because of the way ocd works, you panicked and led yourself to believe that your arousal was caused by the picture of the cat, or furthered by that picture, simply because you didn't automatically stop feeling aroused when the cat picture popped up. I completely understand your worries because it's really distressing when normal feelings (being aroused by your girlfriend) and what can be seen as taboo and horribly wrong (the scary ""what if"" you felt about the possibility of being attracted to cats), feel like they've began to coincide all of a sudden. Just know that this is simply just your ocd being ocd, and you have a big moral compass so any feeling or thought you have that doesn't align with your morals and values basically gets flagged in your mind by your ocd and causes you severe amounts of distress. Ocd is just a bitch like that, I wish you all the best, and I hope you're able to feel more relaxed and at ease with yourself now. ### I‚Äôve had on and off obsessions with this topic. It‚Äôs very uncomfortable, especially when you love those furry little guys. Just remember your brain is trying to find anything that‚Äôs a treat to you and torment you with it! 

Me saying that you aren‚Äôt a furry or attracted to cats is only going to give you a moment of reassurance. Instead of focusing on the exact topic, focus on the *why* you are scared of this. The end line of it is that you‚Äôre scared of being something you aren‚Äôt, this is OCD being your worst enemy. It attacks your morals ### Naw you didn‚Äôt expect the picture of the cat to be there ### Right now you‚Äôre asking for reassurance which is only going to fuel this. What you‚Äôre going to have to do is to stop fighting the thoughts and accept that you may be attracted to cats. This of course isn‚Äôt true, but it‚Äôs how to get rid of the obsession. It‚Äôs very scary in the moment but then the anxiety fades after the exposures. There isn‚Äôt exactly a timeframe, but it‚Äôll get better if you follow those steps. I‚Äôve dealt with sexuality themed OCD so message me if you want ### Here‚Äôs the thing: if you were attracted to cats you would not be disgusted. I know how hellish and uncomfortable the ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù spiral is, but if you can stop it when it starts to happen and remind yourself that you are not a monster and many experience the same realm of obsessions you do and that you are NOT, and I repeat, NOT an exception to this real suffering- you can move past this awful feeling. I‚Äôve dealt with obsessions under this same umbrella. You are not alone and you are NOT a monster. It WILL go away if you stop ruminating. Look up Mark Freeman ocd specialist on YouTube, he helped me so much during my darkest time. ### Edit: as this is posted in NSFW 18+. I'm assuming you're 18+.

Not a professional, this is just my take on the situation. I would say look into research on emotional transference. You care about your gf and were in a state of ""excitement"" and wound up experiencing release with something unexpected in your consciousness. During release, particularly in men chemicals are released (namely oxytocin) that activate the areas of the brain associated with feelings of Love. As this isn't a regular activity the feeling should pass. Though your anxiety about it( which is understandable when experiencing an unexpected and undesirable form of attachment) may make the attachment slightly longer lasting as your building more neurological emotional attachments to this memory. Step back get some pics of your gf that are cat free. Don't try to not think of the cat because you'll think of the cat (brains are funny like that) just work things out with your gf.

If it continues to be a significant form of distress talk to a IRL professional about techniques to get over this. ### Classic OCD at its finest, or worst...

The only thing that helps me in these sorts of moments is to remind myself that THIS IS OCD. It can be easy for me to actually forget that I'm experiencing OCD when I'm truly caught up in it. Instead of focusing on convincing yourself you're not attracted to cats, instead try to focus on reminding yourself that this is such a cliche OCD scenario. Helps me anyway. ### This happens to me, but its for men, pictures of men popping up always lingers around, and this does not help with absolute duchebags in my school calling me gay based off of looks or for laughs and jibs. ### We are not our own thoughts. Our mind has thousands of thoughts a day, random thoughts too like you thinking you‚Äôre into cats. OCD puts that in overdrive. It‚Äôs ok you don‚Äôt have to listen to that thought that you‚Äôre into cats because you aren‚Äôt. Your brain is trying to make a big thing out of something small. ### I know its difficult but when your brain tries to ruin your day with these thoughts just say ""yeah whatever lol"" and move on. Over time your ocd will learn who is the boss and be less powerful. ### You are not attracted to cats. Relax ### Same. But I was doing it for some milfs and then google showed me a pic of a girl that looked extremely young but with big tits. I felt bad later but just kinda of accepted that as long as there where big tits it would do it for me. 

Am I that bad? Idk. ### [deleted] ### OCD conflates dumb shit just to piss you off, and this is a textbook example. That's pretty much how the whole thing works. ### Maybe you‚Äôre just a furry? ### On my case I apparently have pocd and am scared because of course it's frigging wrong and disgusting.

thsevj,"How should i act toward these coincidences? Im sorry that i share so much about coincidences but it doesn't end. so like many OCD patients, i have obsessions about numbers. I gave a lot of meaning to various numbers. Last time when i was between awakeness and sleep i don't know what i was thinking about but i counting numbers and when i reached this specific number (im afraid of because i associate this number with my intrusive thougt) , i heard a woman's voice. Then distracted and wake up. It wasn't dream i just was about to sleep. It was between sleep and awakeness. Then i started stress over why i heard the woman's voice saying my intrusive thought number. Then suddenly my OCD told me look at time if it is x time that means there has a meaning behind this voice. I remembered what was the time when i turned my phone off. Then i stand up and checked time hoping it is not x time. But it was. And 20 minutes passed from the time i turned my phone off and now it was x time. I started feel strong anxiety, why it was exactly that time.

Then the other day in order to make myself calm i bet with my brain that now im gonna look at my phone if the last number of time ends with x number, that means what happened  last night is true and my intrusive thought come  will come real, if not that means it was just a coincidence. i checked time and it ended with x number. 
Days later i was just about to forget that incidence. My cousin came to us and i gave her a question which answer was with number. After gave her this question i regret because i felt she would say that number. She think about that question and said that number. She had 29 number option and she chosed to say my intrusive number. Will i manifested that or that was one of the coincidneces? I really feel bad. There has no cure for this type. It happens so much. Are these delusions?

I've had OCD since I was 8 and have noticed it to have gotten progressively worse as I've aged, I'm 22 and just got diagnosed with bipolar last year so maybe that plays into why it's gotten worse, but I don't know I'm just afraid it will never get better :/ Is there any science behind OCD progressing with age?",5,2022-03-19 12:21:36-04:00,"My experience in helping hundreds of sufferers is that OCD tends to get worse if left untreated. That does directly correlate with aging, but I don't think it's necessarily getting older that causes it to get worse.

OCD also gets worse if you have real life stress to deal with. There is also near overwhelming evidence that females experience worse bouts of OCD in relation to their menstrual cycle. ### I have ocd and bi polar too.  Either one of those is difficult to deal with.  I dont have any answers for you (sorry). I just wanted you to know you arent alone and their are ways to manage both of those ( meds, grounding techniques, cbt therapy etc). ### Maybe I had it as a kid, but it got noticeably bad around puberty.  It was fairly tolerable in my 20‚Äôs and 30‚Äôs and now in my mid 40‚Äôs it‚Äôs getting as bad as it was as a teen.  I think I‚Äôm in peri menopause and that effecting it.  And yes, it‚Äôs much worse the week before my period. ### i totally agree with this and have even considered birth control for it. when i get into a thought loop i just cant fucking stop. my meds help them not come as often but when they do its over. i just dont know how to go about ignoring them and telling myself its just ocd without going into a full blown reassurance bender. thank u so much for ur response and for ur commentary, it means a lot ### I have also both ocd and bipolar and what I realize is my obsessions get worse when I'm depressed, and I almost forget about them when I'm hypomanic. So yeah it gets a little hard to control but it is not something that cannot be managed. As they said therapy would be really helpful if you are really struggling. Rn I'm doing kind of an exposure therapy myself (with the help of someone) and it really works. The thing with ocd is if you do not fight it, it only gets worse.

Mine often shifts between all kinds of harm OCD, inappropriate sexual images, constant guilt and needing to confess, rituals regarding appliances around the house, which really only turns the one person I talk to (my partner) away. I‚Äôve never really been able to get a hold of it‚Ä¶..and I try my best to move on or ignore, Ive tried facing them head on, I‚Äôve tried confessing to relieve guilt and for reassurance, but it seems to constantly leave me dwindling under a dark cloud. It‚Äôs made me feel jaded in all of my relationships, it makes me try to avoid going or doing certain things. I‚Äôve currently been taking Paxil 40mg along with a few different anxiety medicine and nothing really helps. I imagine most medication is to help numb and cope, leaving you to pick up and rearrange the pieces. 

I‚Äôve done this one before, but i decided to write my thoughts out as if I were comfortable speaking them, and both times it‚Äôs resulted in seeming like a suicide note. I‚Äôm tired. I‚Äôve been taking more Xanax than really needed because I can‚Äôt ever seem to relax or get any good sleep anymore. 

The state of the world and the fact what I know I‚Äôm privileged to be where I am just worsens the guilt. Sometimes people around me say it isn‚Äôt real and it‚Äôs all in my head, just move on from it, etc‚Ä¶.but why can‚Äôt I? 

Does it ever stop? Does medication really make a difference if you need to rewire your brain completely either way? 

I know there ARE people who are able to do overcome this. Are we doomed due to the inevitable stressors in the world and country surrounding us?

thurzd,"Forgive and never forget Hi. I'm not sure what to say, cause I've never seen anyone talk about this and not sure if this is an OCD thing. 

I've been having some problems when it comes to forgiving things. My brain immediately goes to ""if someone did something bad they are bad and you need to be afraid"". I obsess about the things people said or did for months and years. I feel like such a toxic person for this. Why can't I forgive and forget? How to stop obsessing about the past?

thmfub,"Disappointing family and friends I hate disappointing my wife and kids. This week my son told me that he wished I spent more time with him. And my wife told me that she feels very distant from me because we don‚Äôt spend time together.

tgzv0v,Have you guys watched Encanto? Under the Surface is such a relating feeling??? Like feeling like I have to be perfect while having pressure dripping that‚Äôll never stop as OCD. I‚Äôm bawling.,18,2022-03-18 08:09:24-04:00,"and Bruno seems to have some OCD tendancies aswell. Good film imo. ### I have watched it. The songs I find most relatable are Waiting on a Miracle and What Else Can I Do, but I resonate with Surface Pressure as well ### Yeah the movie is great at sharing and expressing different roles that people might have in a family, both toxic and non toxic. ### Surface Pressure made me cry the first time, it's my favourite song from the film. But Waiting on a Miracle is far more relatable to me, and to an extent What Else Can I Do ### I heard somewhere that they wrote brunos character with the idea that he suffers from ocd ### Yes!!!! ### no I cried at waiting on a miracle cus it was relatable ### I love that movie. I know the chances of Bruno having OCD are slim to none, but I relate to him with how he feels the need to repeat certain behaviors to prevent bad things from happening. Not to mention, the songs are amazing and also incredibly relatable as well. 

Disney needs to produce more movies like that. ### No. Now that you posted this, I have to see it lol. ### Have not seen it but have definitely heard that song before. And yeah I can totally relate.

At some point I posted before frustration about having to handle everything before/after/during meltdowns/rumination because life simply doesn't stop, which is only made worse by people who don't know about my condition(s) or don't believe me (which is nearly everyone lol). To make things worse, I feel bad about confiding in the people who *do* know what I'm going through because it feels like reassurance.

So yeah ""drip drip drip"" ### no because I‚Äôve listened to that song every day for the past month and watched the movie 4 times because of surface pressure üòÇüòÇ 

It wraps up the eldest daughter family trauma, ocd, and insecurities all into one little song! ### That song made me fucking cry, and I haven't cried in years ### Waiting on a Miracle makes me cry. And Dos Origuitas. Such a great movie and sound track overall. ### yes, Louisa and Brunos stories hit me really hard for this reason, especially Louisa w me being the oldest of my 7 other siblings. ### I think the fact that his ‚Äúgift‚Äù is seeing the future is also a sly reference to OCD.  

My OCD definitely revolves around worrying about future calamity and performing rituals to attempt to circumvent it.

This is probably going too deep, but there‚Äôs also a sort of darkness you carry as this person who is always waiting to get sick, or make someone else sick, or curse someone, or run over someone with your car, or blaspheme, or whatever.  

Worrying about death and dying when other people are worried about normal daily annoyances is an extremely othering, isolating experience.

At the end, I really wanted Bruno to just freaking leave‚ÄîBruno, dude, yes, they‚Äôre your family, but they‚Äôve treated you like garbage for something about you that is 0% your fault.  

Bruno, move to the city, get yourself some ERP and a group of people who love and accept you without having to have their house fall down from a spirit earthquake or whatever, first.  OCD king, you deserve better. ### His 'knock on wood' thing springs to mind ### Not slim to none! It‚Äôs allegedly something the writers did on purpose! He knocks on wood, walks on certain wood planks, has anxiety towards the future‚Ä¶yet that‚Äôs his talent. I think it was 100% on purpose. They don‚Äôt just do those things for no reason. It‚Äôs an important part of this character. ### I definitely thought he had it when watching the movie! And I wondered if the creators did that on purpose; I thought it was neat there was finally a character with an accurate portrayal of OCD.

The reason I said there was a ‚Äúslim to none‚Äù chance he had it, is ‚Äòcause everyone on Instagram & TikTok says he doesn‚Äôt have OCD and cancels people who say or even head canons that he does. Personally, I like to think he has it. :) ### ",71,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tgzv0v/have_you_guys_watched_encanto/
thg04r,"OCD is so isolating and lonely No matter how many friends I have, no matter how many solid support systems I have, when it comes to talking about OCD it will just never make as much sense to the non-ocd having people in my life. I feel like im going crazy. I constantly doubt my intentions and when I express it and I know its ocd related, its understood as making excuses for myself. Maybe I say it for reassurance maybe I dont I just want someone to tell me im not crazy. Maybe I just want someone to understand. Maybe I just want someone to consider it and know at least how it affects me and support me like that. But I dont want to put people through that. How do I even ask for that? Iwant to be helped, but i feel so alone. Im already seeing a therapist but it still feels so lonely. This is so so so hard. After a good 3 week streak its all coming back and I cant help but feel suffocated and alone all the time. People want to help, but they just dont get it. I appreciate it but they just dont get and its so frustrating.

The constant self-doubt. Anything I do is scrutinized by me all the time. Maybe I let it happen. Maybe I brought it upon myself. Maybe I actually am terrible and irredeemable. What if its not OCD. What if I greatly harmed people. What if Im just selfish. What if Im only thinking of myself and I cant be helped. Maybe I intended for it to happen. Maybe that was my motive all along.

Why cant my mind just be left alone. Why cant I just breathe. Why cant I just see life again. I feel so lost and am mourning everything that has been affected negatively by this. I just want to be better. But i keep making mistakes. I keep fucking up. Maybe i deserve this pain and everything that comes with it. Why cant I be better even though Im trying to.

I had OCD and compulsions. My mind forced me to torture myself physically and mentally for hours on end at night and during the day for 10 years. I never talked to anyone, got absolutely no help and suffered in silence.

Think about your situation, about your thoughts. Why do they keep spinning round your head? Simple, you want them to stay away from your thoughts, subconsciously think about them, and the more you think and worry about them coming back, the more often they will appear again in your head.

Which type of thoughts they are and why do they appear? Do you feel guilty about something? Do you feel as if you have a spiritual connection to the fate that is reflected by these thoughts if they are negative, submerging yourself in a non existent world, created by your own mind? An example, if you feel like you do not counter the thoughts with different thoughts or compulsions, do you feel like something bad will happen? ### Make sure to be kind to yourself and remind yourself that your OCD doesn‚Äôt define you and it doesn‚Äôt make you a bad person.

thl13g,"Can Someone Please Tell Me It Gets Better Hi all. I was just diagnosed this year, after a really bad ‚Äúspell‚Äù began in September. I‚Äôm in therapy and on medication, and I‚Äôve been feeling better for a few weeks but it‚Äôs all come crashing down again over the last few days. I‚Äôm so depressed. 

I‚Äôve made it through these rough patches before, even before know what OCD even was. But it feels like this one is never going to end. I feel cortisol and anxiety all over my body, I just want to go to sleep forever (not die, just sleep until the anxiety, anger and frustration disappear). 

I‚Äôd love to hear about how some of you are doing better, living better lives, finding love and acceptance in the world. I need hope right now because I have none.",6,2022-03-18 22:01:30-04:00,"It does! I'll give the negative bit first, then the positive bits since there are far more of them.

When my depression started getting stronger, I actually found myself too exhausted to focus on the things I obsessed over.

On the positive end, self-acceptance goes a long way. Don't get mad at yourself because you have to check the door locks five times. Just check the locks five times and move on.

When I was in middle school, I was incredibly bothered by some shelves where people put their binders after class ended. It was a class you had to take every year, so for the three semesters (in total) I was in that class, I started organizing the binders as soon as people started putting them on the shelves. We only had 5 minutes between classes, and I'm honestly astonished that it never made me late. Though I didn't overcome it at the time, it's not something I stress about anymore.

Something else that helped was to find my own loopholes. As I just mentioned, I had a problem where I had to have everything straightened properly. I lost a lot of time and energy dealing with that. So much time and energy... So I intentionally started putting my belongings askew. They don't have to be in a perfect stack, because I want them to be at an angle, on purpose. It took a while to convince myself of this, and it honestly was freeing. So freeing, in fact, that I now have a bit more difficulty keeping my stuff neat. I feel so much less stressed about that stuff now.

For me, my obsessions and compulsions change every several years. I'll fixate on certain things for like 6 years, then it'll change to something else. Then I have to relearn my coping techniques. But once I do that, it's not as hard until they change again.

A weighted blanket can be very calming for that skin-crawling feeling you seem to be getting. On super-stressful days, try lying down with it covering as much of your body as you can stand, then play some relaxing music.

It helps to have someone who can see the signs of you being overwhelmed by it. That person can then physically remove/take away the source of your stress and/or help you with coping and re-centering yourself. Someone who loves me can notice what's happening and help me course-correct.

If your habits are taking a ton of your time, try to see if you can adjust them downward. If you're checking your locks 25 times before you leave home, try checking them only 24 or even  23 times, then work your way to a lower number until you find yourself unable to go any further. I certainly had an issue with letting my obsessions overtake my time, and it affects my time much less often now.

One of my issues in college was worrying that I hadn't locked the door of my dorm room. I was a third of the way to class when I turned around one time. So I built in extra time for my walk to class. That way, if something happened, I'd still have time to get to class and not be late. I had obsessions about being late, so when I was nearly to class and started worrying about my door, I had to choose between my obsession (never, ever being late) and my obsessive compulsion (checking the lock on my door).

Did I want to risk being late for something I'd probably taken care of? Would it make a difference for my room to be unlocked for that brief period of time, since I was planning on going back to my room afterward anyway? Was checking my door worth being late over?

Throughout college and grad school (7 years), not once was my concern validated, not counting times where I remembered before I'd even left my floor. I'd locked my door on autopilot. Once I realized that, I've become much less stressed about it beyond school. I'll check locks a few times and move on.

As for therapy and medication, keep at it!! Those can really help you focus on what's important in your life.

And of course, self-care is important. Take time to do things you enjoy, even if it's something simple like coloring or cuddling with a dog. You should also do self-care when you're not feeling down or frustrated. Just think of it like maintenance. Taking care of myself is a great way to maintain a level head for a little bit longer.

I personally keep a computer folder where I save things that make me laugh, smile, or otherwise feel better on any given day. When I'm having a tough time, I look through it until I start laughing. And then I keep going! One time, I was sending my best ones to a friend, and I laughed so hard that I started crying. It was really therapeutic, honestly. This has helped me greatly.

OCD is, at its core, an anxiety disorder. If you can find treatments or comforts that lessen your anxiety to any extent, they will do wonders for your fixations and feelings. I now rarely have panic or anxiety attacks (there was a time when I was literally taking fast-acting anxiety medication at least once a week, sometimes twice), and my obsessions and compulsions have much less power over me than they used to. It really does get easier.

You are already a rock-star because you're doing your best to make your situation suck less. Acknowledging where you're at is a huge step. The awful stages pass eventually, despite how it feels like they'll never end. You can get through this!! I believe in you! Best of luck. <3

Sorry if this is overly long or doesn't help you... This is what I felt compelled to write, so I hope it brings you some comfort or understanding.

\---

Note:

I am not officially diagnosed, nor am I a doctor of any kind, though I did study psychology as my minor in college, which is no substitute for medical experience/knowledge.

I know for a fact that I have obsessions, compulsions, and obsessive compulsions, and I began having them before I could even speak. It made my childhood a real struggle because I didn't know how to express what I was experiencing, nor did I realize that other kids didn't have these thoughts or fixations to the extent that I did. ### Yes, things absolutely do get better, it just takes work.

I've had my diagnosis since I was 7 (20 now), and at times it's been absolute hell. I've been hospitalized several times before, and doctors have had to do lots of messing around with medication to get me to where I am now, but things do get better.

It definitely feels hopeless at times, and it's easy to get completely overwhelmed. Finding the right balance of medication and or therapeutic treatment is different for everyone, and for many people, OCD can fluctuate in severity over time. Personally, my OCD fluctuates lots from month to month. Sometimes I'll go months without experiencing any distress from my condition, other times I can spend a day stuck in my bedroom, paralyzed by my obsessions and compulsions.

One thing is for certain though; OCD gets easier and easier to manage over time. The more you work with your doctor, the more you'll find ways to cope and to get a grip on your illness. I personally haven't had a severe panic attack in what's coming up on 2 years. You learn strategies, you learn more about yourself, and how to manage with the world around you when you feel like everything is in imminent doom.

OCD makes it feel like your entire life is collapsing, and it is exhausting. It will get better though, and one of the things you learn when you've dealt with this illness long enough is that it always gets better.

Hang in there and don't give up! It might feel like everything is falling apart, but it won't stay that way. You will get to a point where you'll be able to manage and be able to live a happy life with your condition.

If you feel like you absolutely need help, talk to your doctor immediately, they can help.

I'm diagnosed with ocd and have been a lifelong sufferer (i'm a 25 year old female). After attending several years of counseling and also treating my hashimoto's thyroid issues I was extreamlt surprised to find my ocd symptoms largely went away! I still had flare ups, of course, but I was able to be off all meds for that the past year. It was so bad prior that I was hospitalized for it twice. Yikes!
 I did recently and the results shocked me. Now, there's a LOT of very stressful and upsetting events going on lately mixed with me taking some asthma control meds that makes me mental health worse (on going issue I was already aware of) but I had to recover my lungs after covid. 
After the last 2 days I ended up getting an appointment with a doctor and going back on 2 meds that previously helped me a lot, in addition to getting my thyroid hormones check (i'm low again). Hopefully a few months of this will helpnme get fully back on track and then I will reconsider trying to be med free again.

I have a few stressful family issues in my own family at the moment as well. I think I had the perfect mix for an ocd relapse and to be honest, nothing has ever terrified me like that before! I lived almost my whole life in that awful state and I somehow went from mostly okay to debating inpatient treatment from the sheer fear I was feeling. 
But, i'm back on buspar and abilify as of today, both of which helped me a LOT for ocd and general anxiety. Hopefully in a month or two I will be in a good enough place to try and get off the meds. ### It's a strong mix of multiple types. I've had many themes over the years ranging from checking, contamination, religious ect.
Currently I just got back on abilify, which worked the best for my ocd out of trying like 20+ meds, and buspar, which is good for my general anxiety. ### Thanks so much for the reply! Hormones and stress definitely hold massive power! I found your reply comforting in the sense that i'm not alone and that I can go on into life with long periods of ocd remission! I hope the next remission cycle is more than the year I just had! That makes me so hopeful!
May I ask, did you take any medications for your ocd while pregnant? My husband and I are trying to concieve (after years of infertility) and i'm back on my abilify and buspar, but the doctors i've spoken to seem to be comfortable with those for the most part, yet I am worried about breastfeeding if I have a kid and passing meds via that. I've been considering reaching out to other women to ask their experience :)

Thanks! ### Yeah that is alot of stressful things to happen all at once, I'm sure nobody can blame you for your OCD coming back. Taking it slow and keeping your husband in the Loop about what's going on with your OCD will have you back in no time, I'm sure of it :) ### I‚Äôve never taken meds for ocd, actually.  I probably should have when I was a teen but I didn‚Äôt understand what was going on and didn‚Äôt ask for help.  Looking back, I can see that it started as a kid, then got really bad around 16????  It was much better in college, I think because I was happier and maybe because the puberty hormones had settled.  Then I wasn‚Äôt much effected by it until this past year.  I know it‚Äôs different for many women but I think the pregnancy/breastfeeding hormones were protective for me.  So, weaning, combined with pandemic stress, combined with what‚Äôs likely peri menopause really threw me back into it.  

That‚Äôs not to say I wasn‚Äôt sort of ocd, if you know what I mean, but it wasn‚Äôt debilitating at all. ### Watch the thyroid hormones if you‚Äôre trying to conceive‚Äîthey‚Äôve got to be under 2.5.  The tsh, I mean. ### Thanks so much! 
And yes, my endo has me right in an 'optimal range for conception' so fingers crossed! I wish that info was more widely known - I didnt know until he mentioned it a few months ago! ### Here‚Äôs something else to think about.  So, I read a bunch of research that advocated upping your dose as soon as you get a positive pregnancy test.  I believe the recommendation is to go up 25% or the equivalent of two extra pills a week.  The reason for this is that hormone requirements go up a LOT in early pregnancy and if you wait for a tsh test at 4 weeks post pregnancy test, then the tsh can already be high.  By the time you up the dose it can take a couple weeks to stabilize the tsh, meaning you may have gone several weeks without enough hormone for baby‚Äîduring the period it‚Äôs most critical for them.  

Sorry, I realize this seems OCD.  Lol.  Just something to keep in mind and talk to your doctor about. ### No, I appreciate this sooo much!! I'm diagnosed with hashimotos and I'm often on the hashimotos reddit page - it's super important! 
I appreciate all your help! :) ### ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tho761/sudden_relapse_of_symptoms/
thqvf5,"OCD ever try to make you dislike something you love? I haven‚Äôt had this in a while but it struck me a bit recently tonight. My brother and I talk about science-fantasy and we come from two different views on it. He thinks it‚Äôs stupid and that the two genres should be separate, while I frankly love it and think it offers its own unique ways of storytelling and creates fascinating universes.

Suddenly tonight it just popped up in my mind, ‚ÄúWhat if he‚Äôs right?‚Äù. This shouldn‚Äôt be able to dissuade years of reasons for liking the genre, but the anxiety surrounding it quickly escalated and made me start to think if these were my own thoughts and not just some question that came up in my mind.

thlgpt,"More Zoloft questions I saw someone just made a post about zoloft or sertraline specifically which I saved because a lot of the answers were really helpful. I just got diagnosed with OCD today, I‚Äôm not familiar with medications for mental illness in anyway and discovering OCD and everything was shocking for me so I didn‚Äôt ask the right questions when I was at the doctor and I wanted to see if anyone who‚Äôs actually taken it could answer them?

How long did you take the medication? I‚Äôve got a prescription that will last me 3 months and hopefully I‚Äôll be in therapy within a month or two. I know it‚Äôs normal to take medications long term, I‚Äôve just never done it and I‚Äôm kind of wary and want to know the time frame. One of my fears is just that I‚Äôve heard stuff about taking medication and your brain forgetting how to make the chemicals or something, this won‚Äôt have long term effects like that though right? 

From what I understand I‚Äôd be taking it short term but eventually weening off as I go through or complete therapy. Also, I‚Äôm worried about my sex drive and weight gain. I could deal with a lower sex drive for a period of time, I am worried because I have spent like 3 months losing weight, and then the doctor told me one of the side effects could be weight gain. I do workout and eat at a healthy calorie deficit so I‚Äôm hoping I don‚Äôt lose my progress?

I‚Äôm also kind of concerned about Zoloft addictions? I‚Äôm supposed to take is daily and I guess ween off at some point, I‚Äôm worried about developing a dependence or addiction? 

Also, does therapy help along with the medication. I read online therapy is the best thing especially the ERP and CBT and the doctor did tell me therapy is the primary treatment so I plan on getting in soon. So is it that therapy will give me the tools to get off the medication, or the medication will put me in a place where I realize I can live without obsessing and compulsions in addition to the tools I learn in therapy, or what has been your experience? 

Generally hopeful but just wary because I‚Äôm also wary about medications.",2,2022-03-18 22:26:24-04:00,"Based on my experience, it does help and the side affects, especially weight gain shouldn't be worried about as much. For reference, I used to be on abilify for my OCD, and gained around 20lb, then I stopped with the abilify and went on Zoloft and only gained around 5 or so pounds, and I stayed at that weight instead of the weight going up more. 


I'm not sure how it affects sex drive, but it does help with anxiety, specifically it helps you stop overthinking things.


For me, my compulsions stuck around, but because I didn't overthink things as much, I did them less, and it didn't take as long. The therapy usually helps with the meds, so doing both I've personally seen a lot of improvement, that and I've been sleeping a bit better as a side affect of the Zoloft.


So you don't have much to worry about, and in my experience it helps a bit with the OCD,

Good luck, and hopefully you get a bit better soon! ### Thank you!! ### ",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/thlgpt/more_zoloft_questions/

thcja3,"Plagiarism OCD in University Please Help Hi everyone,

I was just wondering if anyone could relate to being extremely paranoid over accidental plagiarism in college or university. I am currently in third year university and I have never plagiarized in my life and would never even think of doing it, but I was reading up on the school's policy for accidental plagiarism and they take that very seriously. This has made me really really anxious writing essays this semester. One of the ways somebody can commit plagiarism is by taking the ideas of somebody and passing them off as your own. I am really anxious about that when I am elaborating on information from my sources. Like for example if one of my sources states that (just making this up): ""women are 80% more likely to experience physical violence than men"" and I use cite this statistic in my essay, and elaborate in my own words and thoughts by saying ""this could arguably be related to how many women have a fear of walking alone at night,"" like these are my own thoughts and ideas but how do I know that one of my sources didn't say something similar to this and I did not see or write it down?? Now I have pulled all my sentences where I made my ""own"" observations from my essay into a separate document and I am re-reading all my journal articles and chapters to see if I accidentally plagiarized or took ideas without realizing. I am so fucking tired of this, I am sick of university, I am sick with anxiety over the fact that I don't know if I am accidentally plagiarizing.

I can't ever even bring up these concerns to anyone at university because I am scared that they will see how worried I am about accidentally plagiarizing and they will think that I have in fact plagiarized and that's why I am freaking out and then they will pull all my written submissions throughout the past 3 years and go through all them and what if they find that I did accidentally plagiarize?? Fuck school, has anyone else gone through this??

My essay was due yesterday and I started the process of rereading all my sources at 8:30 pm yesterday but I got through one article and had to reread it and almost started crying in the library so I just drove to my moms and now I am rereading that same article and I am just rereading the first two paragraphs over and over because I have to reread my observations/statements and then go back and look over the article. I still have 5 more sources to do this with. I would just rather not submit an essay than be so fucking worried I accidentally plagiarized",13,2022-03-18 15:05:03-04:00,"I absolutely had this when I was at uni, however I wasn‚Äôt diagnosed with OCD at the time and had no idea it was even OCD. I would spent days and days going through my work, checking notes, completely even changing my entire argument/essay in case I accidentally plagiarised without realising.

You‚Äôve got to remember they‚Äôre not out to trick you with plagiarism. The warnings from the university are there purely to stop people writing word for word what someone else has said. As long as you are making an effort to reference, they know you aren‚Äôt plagiarising.

Also I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre studying, but often it‚Äôs pretty difficult to come up with a 100% original idea. I did history and although my arguments were my own, they were all completely rooted in stuff I‚Äôd read and were just a mish-mash of what other scholars had said.

I can absolutely guarantee that as long as you are making some references, and not just copy & pasting pieces of text into your essay, that you aren‚Äôt plagiarising.

Remember, OCD is a bully and is always trying to make you panic. These are just OCD thoughts and not a reflection of you. ### i'm sorry that sounds really difficult :( is there a counseling/therapy service at your uni? It might be worth looking into if so, and I'm sure they won't think you've plagiarized, and the professors are too busy to bother going over all your past work anyway! Plus there is software out there that scans your document for plagiarism anyway, but a) this may be feeding your ocd even if it makes your life easier, and b) sometimes if the cover sheet or question provided by the uni for the project is in the doc the software will think that's plagiarism even though it's obviously not, so isn't always v helpful.

Anyway most of what i said there is irrelevant because ik logic doesn't help with ocd, which is why i'd really recommend therapy. helped me immensely.

i hope you have a great day and good luck with your assignments :) ### This is a super common fear; there‚Äôs actually other threads about that in this sub. When I was in uni, I used to use this program online that was free called Paper Rater. It runs your paper through a data base and shows you what may be plagiarized. As long as you‚Äôve quoted and sourced the article properly, you shouldn‚Äôt worry about it! ### Hi,If you want to take the best tips for [phd writing](https://assignmentfriend.com/blogs/thesis/) then there is one who can provide the best possible tips which is¬†assignment friend.I have taken the services of assignment friend and must say they provide high-quality writing service, particularly in the area of the dissertation, and deliver professional assistance the students whenever they needed. They have employed the best dissertation writers who have acquired positive feedback from the clients. ### Thank you so much for your reply, I really appreciate it. I was also in history but I am in sociology with a minor in history now but my paper is for anthropology, and you are 100% right, it is extremely difficult to formulate a completely original idea and this is why I get so anxious over the vagueness of accidental plagiarism. You are right though that these thoughts are not real. I just needed to know that there was someone out there who can understand, I always hear people saying how they rush to complete an essay in 2 nights or something but I cannot imagine doing that with the sheer amount of time I take looking things over, makes me sad how I am wasting time though. Thanks again!! ### I know it is definitely silly to even think the professors would want to go through the effort to go through all my past work, I feel like I am out to lunch half the time with my thought process! I know I should seek out the counselling services because I don't know how I will be able to write essays next year going through this process, but I think I will worry about that in the summer, I will definitely look into therapy. The most ridiculous part is that there is a plagiarism checker that our assignments go through when we submit them that we can check and change any parts where we may have plagiarized and resubmit by in my messed up head I think it will miss something or I will have accidentally stolen an idea not necessarily a string of words. Anyways thank you so much for your reply, I hope you have an awesome weekend <33 ### Thank you for the suggestion :)) will definitely keep that in mind! ### Thank you! <3 ### I had the exact same anxiety too. I didn't feel better about it until I realized this: the paper is like you're chatting with someone, and the cited work is the first ""text message"", and your response is the other ""text message"" that doesn't need a citation. It's only plagiarism if you use the ""first text"" and then answer it with someone else's ""text"" that implies it's your idea. 

So if you turned in something like this:

""World war 2 could have been prevented if Franz Ferdinand wasn't assassinated, / but this is  oversimplifying things, and if you look at the preceding events, the war was inevitable."" 

Professors would be able to tell that everything before the slash isn't an idea you're pretending is yours because you're responding to it right after. If I was proofreading your paper I'd say ""source?"" Instead of thinking you were trying to steal an idea. 

Even in reddit comments, you'll see someone quote a study but not cite it, and all of the responses will say ""source?"" Instead of people thinking that the information was stolen. So it's easy for people to tell what things you're quoting even if every single footnote was missing. 

Also if you want to talk about this in depth you can message me. I had it SO BAD during highschool, because any cheating was met with academic probation for the first offense, and we had to write ""I pledge my honor"" and sign our name underneath for everything we turned in. Shit was crazy. I study copyright laws as a hobby now, haha. ### Absolutely understand where you‚Äôre coming from and can completely empathise - you‚Äôre not alone in these thoughts and you‚Äôre not a bad person for having them. It‚Äôs just the OCD and other people who don‚Äôt have OCD will just be writing similarly to you (in that they reference the same amount and use similar arguments), but they don‚Äôt have to deal with this extra stress.

How did/is the essay going, did you get to submit it? ### i'm with you on the out to lunch with my thought process !! ocd will do whatever it can to convince us it's right. it's frustrating, isn't it? I used to have a bit of an issue with plagiarism stuff when i was younger, i'd even write what random words i'd found the meaning of in the google dictionary lol- like why would the teachers care about that?!

also thanks! gl with looking into counselling/therapy and that, I hope you have a great weekend too :) ### Hi, thanks for your reply, you made a lot of great points. I guess part of my problem is of course assuming the worse and like the professors are out to get me and trap me somehow, I have really bad paranoia hence why I have never seeked out counselling - I am too worried the school would somehow turn my worries against me and think I am panicking over plagiarism because I have done it when in reality as far as I know I have not. Anyways, I could not imagine going through that in high school!! I understand that academic institutions need to uphold these rules to make sure cases are not falling through the cracks and to keep academic integrity but holy is it ever terrible for people suffering with this.

Using my phone right now is making me worried they're sending me subliminal messages to make it so I won't be able to do martial arts as good as I could.
I don't know if this is a good idea whether or not being as bad as it was if I should have tried to be more slow about it and gradual but lately it was just so bad that I just was tired of doing it so I just stop a lot of my compulsions and whenever I throw a punch or a kick I don't know if it's flawed because of the lacking of practicing consistently because a few months ago some of these techniques were perfect and now it's not after quitting and my mind is just feeling my head with all kinds of doubts and worries.

I'm considering turning myself in as an inpatient because of this because I don't know if my brain will ever shut off and stop sending me messages or using my mom's voice to mimic my own in order to try and scare me into doing my compulsions again.

thehsr,"OCD‚Äôs fake logic Another thing people don‚Äôt talk about enough with ocd. There‚Äôs such an emphasis on it being ‚Äúirrational‚Äù that it gives the impression that your mental compulsions are utterly irrational, when in my experience they usually have a kind of logic to them. They are usually based roughly on some truth, albeit grossly exaggerated. And from that truth (germs make you sick, for instance), your ocd wrongly assumes that it‚Äôs likely that you‚Äôll get sick, and then you start building a system of logic about how germs likely travel, who and what you touched, how long. 

All that rumination is a kind of logic, which is part of what makes it so powerful. You think, clearly this is a rational and reasonable thing to do! I‚Äôm calculating the likelihood of being harmed! But the reality is that you began from a faulty premise (that the risk was never remotely high enough to be worth evaluating) and involved several faulty assumptions (you can calculate or estimate the odds of things completely out of your control!). 

Anyway. This hit me today and I think it‚Äôs important. If you label a thought as obsessive, and then you catch yourself using ‚Äúlogic‚Äù compulsively to resolve it, don‚Äôt be surprised if your ocd brain says, ‚ÄúHey! This isn‚Äôt irrational ocd! This is careful, responsible analysis of a potentially dangerous situation! See all the logic?‚Äù

No. It's more like, YOUR HANDS ARE COVERED IN FILTHY, DISGUSTING GERMS AND THEY'RE GOING TO GET ALL OVER EVERYTHING AND EVERYTHING WILL BE RUINED!!!!!!

thkolq,"Stuck with a single moment and can't think anything else, please help! It makes me feel like i'm a bad person. (I beg of you, please take a moment and read, or just come to talk with me, i don't know what to do anymore :'/) Hi. I needed to talk this with someone so i came here, i hope i can get your help through this. Today something happened in minutes and here i am after many hours still trying to correct that moment to keep going in my line of comfort. I had a huge stress over me for an hour when it happened, i could think properly before my anxiety flared up but after that, it doesn't happen for some reason. Here's the short story of my trouble.

Today i was happy and very comfortable about being able to think with a smile on my face to everything, anything used to bother me wouldn't stay longer than a few seconds because i was good! I came back home, got myself into weather of a relaxing evening, everything was ready to be lived nicely and i was so comfortable :) I prepared myself a nice few things to accompany me while watching a peaceful video, all was wonderful. I was so excited to have a beautiful evening.

  Then i wanted to check reddit before doing these things i mentioned, to see if i had any notifications   
  on my accounts (i have a few accounts). While changing them, i saw a post from a subreddit i hate   
  (full of creeps, low esteem people who know no bounds) and i took a look by accident. It seemed to   
  be something funny, though it wasn't; i just said they were being typical weirdos again and moved on   
  but after that i looked up a little more and i don't know why did i do this, saw another post which was   
  terrible. 

(TW): That was a news of 2 highschool students' suicide upon agree with a message picture to a   
friend's phone. At first, i didn't have something abnormal but then i had that moment i can't   
remember. First, people were sympathizing their situation (most of them were against it though) by   
saying it's all about government's fault, they should resign because of this, country's conditions   
made this happen etc. and i didn't get it, it was nonsense. They were 15 years old and it could be   
anything rather than being due to just a single reason. I thought against them and i know what i   
thought was right. Then i wanted to feel sorry for them but they were just being ridiculous (doesn't   
have a funny part but the word is this) because they told their friend that both of them were going   
to suicide in the message. I couldn't understand the reason of it but i got angry to be honest, who   
would write this to someone they know, it'd be traumatizing for the person reading it!! 

   Their pictures were also on the post too, i saw their faces and couldn't stop myself but to think bad about them. I don't want to be misunderstood but when i saw a face like this, i know what type of a person they probably are in school in my country. I've seen a lot but this doesn't prove anything, just assuming. I got angry to their stupid actions like writing that message etc. and when i looked to their face i began thinking very furious things about them. I'll tell the reason of these thoughts but i'll tell the thoughts that make me feel terrible first. 

  
\- ''They are like these weird people, they deserved it with that mindset. They didn't want to hurt   
anyone but themselves but they just hurt many more they probably didn't think of, now everyone   
has to deal with their actions' results and effects on themselves. Maybe most of them will have a   
traumatizing experience just by knowing them in their class, sharing the same school or reading   
that message.'' 

I just spewed a grudge on them, i was getting angrier every passing second. There also were their   
pictures hanging down on the tree (censored), WTF!!! 

My evening was ruined after this, my peace and comfort was disturbed. I was angry, because i was   
kept away from the calmness of my mind. I looked up to their faces and began swearing with that   
anger. I was disturbed so much and couldn't get it out of my way, did this as a reaction. 

THEN the moment came, i felt terrible for doing this. I wouldn't do such thing to this situation and i had a moment that i describe it as ''i lost the ability of thinking, of my mind''. I forgot what have i thought, i forgot how i was before that moment but all i had was a heavy stress over me and a mind i can't control. I was distracted for a moment but anxiety hit me right at that second, i couldn't remember or think properly. My mind functions were gone, to be short. All i had was a moment i have to FIX, in order to get my mind back, it was there that i couldn't function as normal. I spent an hour lying down on the floor trying to remember what i told to them, what i did wrong. But i couldn't, it's like a blank memory my mind can't process even after hours. Because i couldn't take this stress off of me and my obsession with it takes all of my attention. 

I don't know what to do anymore, i think of saying fuck it all and go on with my time but i know i'll feel bad for doing this. I can't even write a TL;DR anymore, it's too hard to put the reason of all this into letters. I just want to go back in time and never live this moment at all. I feel like a broken machine at the moment, i can't stand up against wrong things my ocd telling me. I, don't, know. Please help me, a little bit of talk would be great.

I have the same problem and my OCD always tries to find something bad about me. At first I tried to fight it, justified myself, and in the end, again and again, I found new reasons for self-humiliation. But then I just realized, that it makes no sense. I am always able to find something horrible about me, but why should I do this? Yeah, I did bad things, maybe even horrible things, but what can I do? I don't want to torture myself with my memories, I just wanna live and enjoy my life and this fucking OCD won't destroy my mind! Just try to understand it and be strong! Everything will be fine :) ### I'm receiving medication and it helps a lot but i'm having these terrible moments from time to time. Thank you for your concern, i really appreciate it. I'm exhausted from losing my thinking due to obsessive things, this is one of them. I somehow can't stop it and live as i was before, i struggle to put two words together after moments like this. My ears burn all day through and i'm feeling unpleasant :'( ### The problem is, the more you pay attention to the obsessions, the more your brain sees them as important. Can you access ERP? It sounds like you are having a horrible time. ### I was too tired but didn't feel like it, actually i could think great before that moment but i don't understand why does moments like these snap somethings in my brain. It's like my functions are being broken, not correct after it. I can make mistakes with the effects of sleep maybe but why can't i see nothing other than my mistake? I don't want to give 2 hours of sleep as a reason but... i don't know. The counter argument comes like this; then you shouldn't be able to do great with that sleep (?). I think my suspicion plays a game on me with this one sentence, when you're sleepy you can make mistakes more often etc. but it tries to make me not listen to it even though i know that's the truth.  


Sorry for venting here, i can't access erp with a professional but i'm always trying to do myself. I'm very good at it usually, but sometimes i can't manage to do it. Maybe stress or other factors but i can't make it work while being in such moments :( ### That‚Äôs understandable. I struggle with sleep too and ERP is so difficult when you‚Äôre exhausted. But your brain feels like it‚Äôs misfiring because it is so focused on reacting with fear to these obsessive thoughts. ### I find myself in fear when i happen to lose my mind in anxiety, it makes it impossible to think and i literally can't do anything. I can't never mind intrusive thoughts etc. and it's a never ending cycle you can't even get a bit of control.

thnn03,"My head feels like it's yelling at me. [potential trigger: dogs and their excrements]

Firstly for context; My mom sometimes baby sits dogs and there's this dog that has zero toilet training and is absolutely spoilt by the owners and she's coming over today, coincidentally my mom is going away today for a day so I'll be alone with the dog. The last time this dog had come over she did her dirty buisness right infront of my room door and I struggled to get in my room for about three weeks even with daily cleaning. And now I'm being left alone with her and I've been on edge all morning.

Secondly, after I woke I was still in my bed for a bit trying not to think about the dog, my mom sat on the bed next to me and her butt touched my leg and that just pushed me over the edge. I've been cleaning my leg for a while now but that spot still feels disgusting and now my hands are gross too. 

I can feel a physical layer of filth on my hands and leg that won't go away even after countless washes with soap. Hand sanitizer usually work great for getting rid of that gross feeling but I think since I'm a bit overwhelmed because of the dog it has stopped working.

Everytime I try to think of something the only thought that comes to my mind is me sitting in a corner covered in dog poop and everytime I open my mouth an image of my mouth being filled with dog poop flashes infront of my eyes. 

I accidentally touched my lips with my ""gross"" hands and now my lips feel gross and they slightly hurt, it's not actual pain it's, well it like to describe it as ""almost pain"", it feels like there should be pain but it doesn't actually hurt. I've been on the edge of tears ever since I woke up because of the dog thing. But we can't refuse to keep her because the owners pay us a bunch because she's not toilet trained and also because my mom doesn't really care about how it affects me.

Suddenly everything has started feel like it's too loud, it seems like every sound just had it's volume doubled, whether that be people speaking or just a tap running with water. I'm trying to calm down but nothing is helping, I tried music because that usually works but that too feels too loud.

I'm still undiagnosed so I don't know for certain if this is OCD but I've been told before by friends and some other  people that are diagnosed with OCD that it is.

th1qd0,"Current state of my hands - red, raw and bleeding. What can I do? They were healed when I did therapy but since I stopped, I started washing them excessively again...How do I solve that?",26,2022-03-18 09:47:59-04:00,"my hands were the same way in middle school. i wasn‚Äôt allowed to see friends unless my hands weren‚Äôt bleeding. i would put lots of thick lotion and let in soak in. that‚Äôs really the only way to help aside from not washing as often and making sure they are lotioned extremely well at night is really helpful ‚ù§Ô∏è ### The solution to cleaning your hands raw is not lotion. It is coming to terms with your OCD, changing the way you think about your obsessions and steadily slowing down your compulsions until you no longer do them. ### I have OCD and also suffered from constant mindless handwashing. My hands bled and hurt, and in the end I decided to stop it. I just analyzed all this and realized that it's not about washing my hands, but that I attach too much importance to it. My brain is trying to protect me from what I shouldn't be afraid of, and in doing so, I'm actually hurting myself. So why should I hurt myself?  For what? What happens if I don't wash my hands again? I tried to take it easy and save myself from real harm (dry skin, pain, etc.). I really understand that it is not so easy to take it and stop it, but after some time of constant analysis of my actions, I got rid of this problem.  Unfortunately, OCD has remained in my daily life, but at least I stopped physically harming myself. Good luck to you :) Be strong and everything will be fine! ### I dint have this compulsion but in the past people have sworn by ""working hands"" hand lotion ### Always put aloe Vera lotion on your hands before you go to bed, that way it allows for your hands to be okay overnight and reheal. That‚Äôs always worked for me.

Try not to use too much sanitizer cause it burns like a MFER!

If you can - try and use a soap with lotion in it or moisturizer.

I hope this helps. ### i had this issue in high school,, thankfully lotion was a temporary fix but i see that you can‚Äôt use it so here‚Äôs generally how i cut down a lot on hand washing- I would wash my hands in a pretty predictable pattern, so i made it a point to force myself not to wash my hands just ONCE a day. Usually I could tell when I would totally panic if i didn‚Äôt and when i would just feel anxious, so I‚Äôd choose carefully, but i eased into exposure. One time a day turned into more, and it became easier to substitute washing them for hand sanitizer (not the best for you but u gotta do what u gotta do). I know I still have to get better about this, but honestly sometimes i just try not to touch anything that will make me feel any urge to wash my hands. That‚Äôs probably not great advice though lol. I think overall I‚Äôve just found different ways to trick myself out of doing it, and though not all of the ways are ultimately what the goal is- I have noticed the compulsion has gotten better overall. much less contamination anxiety than there used to be. ### I believe there are 4 parts to OCD recovery: education, meaning gaining knowledge bout what OCD is, how it manifests and how that applies to your situation; cognitive therapy, which focuses on seeing the errors in your thinking and making changes to your thinking; slowing down and stopping your compulsions; and ERP, which is the art of triggering yourself and not doing compulsions. The last two are parts of Behavioral therapy.

You must, above all, be willing to change, both your thinking and behavior. 

Meds are an option to bring down overall anxiety to make doing the work easier. And it is work.

Self help books can be great, but if you only read one and not DO the work, nothing will happen.

A good OCD therapist is wonderful, but again, if you don't do the work to change, everything will remain the same. 

Oh yeah, and be prepared to get comfortable with being really uncomfortable. ### I'd wish to have that OCD. Dealing with mine has been so bad ### Thank you for the tip but I can‚Äôt stand having lotions on my hands because it makes them feel contaminated :( I‚Äôm trying to reduce the compulsions on my own but it‚Äôs so hard ### I can‚Äôt stand lotion on my hands anyway. But yeah...I understand that. It‚Äôs just so hard :( ### Give me a guide on how to do that tho. ### Hum??? No you don‚Äôt. That‚Äôs extremely debilitating and won‚Äôt let me do anything like normal people ### i‚Äôd refrain from making those statements in the future because there‚Äôs is no worse. OCD is OCD. your words can invalidate a lot of people. ### i completely understand :/ you have the strength within you to do this deep down ‚ù§Ô∏è are you using a gentle hand soap? ### I don‚Äôt know if this will be helpful, but something I‚Äôve noticed about my ocd is that my symptoms seem to get worse the more stressed I am. It‚Äôs like when you feel stressed in your life and like you have less control of your life, your ocd gets worse in order to give you ways to gain ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù, such as acting on compulsions. 

So maybe try to find ways to reduce other stressful things in your life? This is just a thought I had, I hope it helps. Best of luck with everything. <3

Additional thought: if your hands were healed when you were doing therapy, maybe therapy was providing a different sense of control of some sort for you? ### I completely understand I had the same issue a while back, OP all I can say thought is that you HAVE to fight. I sat there letting it soak me up for years and it finally exploded on me, It was so hard to fight my compulsions that I gave up but that is not the answer fight as hard as you can OP things WILL get better I promise you ### At least ya don't get deemed a harasser or try to cut off your own balls thinking you might be a pedo

Therapy helped me greatly but my mother forced me to end it :( ### It‚Äôs still very debilitating. I‚Äôd say at least your hands aren‚Äôt constantly bleeding and you don‚Äôt fear creating a pandemic every day. Plus I have other themes ### could i recommend dr bronners liquid baby soap? i wash my hands a lot and that soap definitely helps but you have to dilute it with water so i use a foaming hand dispenser and put water and the soap in it and it works really well. i learned from drs that soap is anti bacterial even if it‚Äôs not the anti bacterial kind which is harsh on your skin. they said it washes away germs the same way so maybe you could try that? have you tried revisiting what you learned when you reduced your compulsions? i know it‚Äôs hard but i know you can get back to that place ‚ù§Ô∏è ### Hey I struggled with this until I turned to absolute avoidance and wouldn't leave my bed for days, slowly getting better now. Anyways, when my hands and arms were so bad they started peeling, I changed my soap. It is difficult to find a good soap that is antibacterial but I highly highly recommend Simple Soap. I remember it saying ""kills 99.9% of bacteria"", antibacterial, but removes a whole bunch of the bad stuff that can irritate your hands like fragrances. It's super gentle while making me feel somewhat comfortable, if you're in the UK it could be in a Sainsburys or a Morrisons, wishing you all the best on your recovery journey, you got this! ### I‚Äôm sorry to hear that you were forced to end something that was helpful. I‚Äôm not sure if you know this or if it‚Äôs even applicable to you, but in Oregon if you‚Äôre the age of 14+ you don‚Äôt need parental consent to seek mental health services.

Additionally, these compulsions tend to cause interference with our lives and usually aren‚Äôt fun (for example, I would compulsively sweep my apartment multiple times a day in fear that there‚Äôs dirt on the floor, even when no one stepped in that room since my last sweep). Logically, I know that‚Äôs stupid, but for some reason, I had to make sure the room was clean. Not all, but many times, compulsions are emotionally or physically taxing. 

please note‚Äî I am not a doctor or mental health professional, so you can take my response with a grain of salt. 

If you are truly concerned, a doctor and/or counselor might be a good fit. I would do some research yourself and hopefully that might give you a better direction. Best of luck! ### Thank you so much for your reply. I will be booking her an appt but your perspective helps a lot! ### Glad I helped!

thljn6,"This may seem weird but does this mean I'm lesbian? Would really appreciate some answers I'm a straight 20y female and I've been struggling with Hocd for a few months on and off. Just now I remembered something I did as a child and now I think that is evidence for being gay. This is probably the weirdest thing you might hear but oh well. 

When I was about 7 or 10 I used to be aroused like all the time (idk if that is normal for a kid). I used to like watching lesbian porn for pleasure because I thought it was sexy and for some reason a bra and underwear reminded me of sex lmao. So for the weird part I wanted to do the same thing the two women were doing in the video, so I got me and my younger sister to get my mother's bra and pants and put it on (I know) and in a bedroom we recreated the video by kissing. Sorry if that was weird. I think something similar happened again a few years later. But now my hocd is using this as proof that I'm lesbian because I acted on my desire (I can't rememberif I liked it). Doesn't your sexuality happen as a kid? Does this mean I'm lesbian because I found women sexually attractive in porn??",7,2022-03-18 22:30:57-04:00,"I don't think you're going to find any experts here on the subject matter. 

What you are doing is asking for reassurance, a compulsion. With OCD you become fixated on thoughts. You look for evidence for or against the thought (another compulsion)

Doing compulsions will not give you the answer you seek. It will only have you going round and round in your head. 

Leave this alone. ### The only thing that would make you a lesbian is being attracted to women. Eg you enjoy thinking about relationships with them, you'd really want to, you see them in that way etc. ### Thanks.

I'm worried if that means something because some gay people have said if you find someone sexually attractive especially wanting to be with them in porn, that's your sexuality. Is that true? ### What if it feels I do enjoy that, then I panic that I do. Does that mean I'm in denial? ### No. If you truly enjoy it you don't panic afterwards or feel wrong or cry or anything. I enjoy eating chocolate. I never panic after eating chocolate or ruminate or feel awful about it. 

When I'm attracted to a guy (I'm hetero) i don't panic about being into guys. I feel happy and start imagining going on dates and having a relationship and feel happy and excited about it, feeling overjoyed at the idea of it coming true and happening in real life. If you imagine these things but panic because you don't like the idea and would hate for it to happen then it's just OCD. Or anxiety. Or something else. But you're not in denial because you just cannot enjoy something and not want it. :) ### Ok thank you! I appreciate it:) ### No worries! OCD is a monstrous disorder. It will do everything in its willpower to convince you and ruin your life.

thg0in,"Confused and struggling real event ocd Hey guys,

Around August of 2020, I remember getting a flashback to something I did when I was 12/13, that I had completely forgotten I had ever done. From then onwards, I‚Äôve started having ocd symptoms and then go diagnosed late last year (2021). 

I have constant intrusive thoughts and they‚Äôre driving me crazy. I‚Äôve started seeing a psychologist who specialises in ocd but I‚Äôm confused by the recovery. He always asks me what my intrusive thoughts are saying, but I get confused because it‚Äôs nothing concrete. It‚Äôs almost like a feeling of knowing I‚Äôve done something wrong and not letting me escape that. Or that I‚Äôm a bad person and hence I can smile or laugh at things. 

And I don‚Äôt want to invalidate any other types of ocd but I wish my intrusive thoughts were more clear cut and on the basis of ‚ÄúI‚Äôve touched this, hence I‚Äôm contaminated so I must wash my hands‚Äù. 

My psychologist also thinks it‚Äôs firstly not an issue of ocd but of self esteem, which I don‚Äôt know how I feel about.  

It‚Äôs really demotivating as well to think that there isn‚Äôt as clear of a path for recovery in real event ocd. 

It really hurts as well to think that before august 2020, I was so happy and really enjoyed life. Yet now my life feels destroyed and I contemplate whether I even want to be around anymore.

It could be that what you experience is more an intrusive feeling than a thought. Still an obsession.

What your therapist is doing is getting you to deal with the cognitive side of CBT. Looking at your self esteem may come from you believing that an event from when you were 12 somehow mars who you are today. It's called a cognitive distortion.

I like your therapist! ### I struggled with this issue for 10 years and there are no words in which I can describe how much I suffered. I am no psychologist but I would like to give some advice.

Think about that thought in your head and think about how that event affected a person or a group of people.
Did it affect them? If yes then think about how they are now, and that they moved on and might not even remember that experience. So there is no point in blaming yourself, we all do mistakes.

I‚Äôm a teen guy who‚Äôs had persistent inflammatory acne for the past several years, as most teens do. However, I‚Äôve noticed that while most people my age have acne going on the decline, mine seems to still be making itself right at home on and around my forehead, and OTC medications don‚Äôt seem to be working. It‚Äôs not super super bad, but it‚Äôs quite annoying lifting up my hair and being met with a volcanic range of acne pimple in the corner of my face. So I decided to meet with a dermatologist at my local hospital, and they gave me 3 options: topical antibiotics, oral antibiotics, and Accutane. Now, I‚Äôve read plenty about accutane and it‚Äôs side effects, and I‚Äôm particularly concerned about mental side effects in a person with moderate OCD such as myself. I‚Äôve seen conflicting information ranging from studies claiming that accutane can actually *cause* OCD in people that don‚Äôt even have it (or worse, full blown psychosis) to people on other forums stating that they had minimal mental side effects. 

I decided to go with the topical and oral antibiotics until I could get more information on accutane with ocd. So this is the part where I turn to you guys. Has anyone on this forum with OCD taken accutane when they had symptoms present and if so, what were it‚Äôs side effects? Did your condition worsen, improve, or stay the same?

I just feel like taking a loooong nap. Thank God for mom or else I would not even make food to eat, do t have the energy.",6,2022-03-17 18:46:27-04:00,"Omg are you me from another universe?!? I grew up with the internet and have used it for reassurance for as long as I can remember. It absolutely made it worse. The reassurance seeking got so bad that the majority  of my day was spent doing it. My grades fell, I lost hobbies, and I essentially became a shut-in. I used to travel a lot, but I couldn't go more than 15 minutes without looking for reassurance. It didn't help that when I did, I got results that made me believe I was a monster. It was hell. I avoided relationships completely, worried about how I would approach this with them. I shut people out of my life. I ruined friendships.

There were times that I pulled over on the side of the highway just to seek reassurance from reddit or twitter. It was almost like a drug. You get a temporary hit of relief, but then you desire more. So you keep researching situations, thoughts, etc that are like yours but you cannot find anything that fits you exactly, and you go insane. I was so obsessed, so worried about situations that have not even happened yet, and scenarios that I made up in my head.

People who are unfamiliar with OCD truly underestimate the danger of the internet with combined with this illness. I hate to admit this, but I have made many sock-puppet accounts for the purpose of asking questions for reassurance. I started to realize how insane this was getting when I would go seek the reassurance, and the posts I made from weeks, months and years ago would appear first. It has nearly ruined my life, but I've taken control over the past few months, and I'm doing a bit better. ### Yeah, I swear the Internet triggers my ocd so often It‚Äôs agonizing.

The research compulsion is absolutely awful. A big problem I‚Äôve had to realize myself is sometimes I can get fixated on debating with myself if my values are okay at times as well. That can be trying to get reassurance from comment sections or researching stuff that comes from intrusive thoughts. It used to be wayyyy worse a couple of years ago before I knew what was wrong with me. The pandemic making everything go online made the problem 100x worse than it already was. ### I just wish idk I had a job or was still in school then I'd be busy. ### ",103,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tgmipc/this_probably_was_talked_about_before_but_ocd_and/
th9ng5,"Knife Exposure Ideas? (TW: Knives and knife-related thoughts) (Full disclosure that I'm fine and don't even cut myself but was definitely sidelined for a bit by such thoughts.)

Caught off-guard this morning by intrusive thoughts I'm not totally unfamiliar with but don't normally make the cut for ""usual suspects"". I sometimes have a fear that I'm going to stab myself or a loved one. Usually happens when I'm handling kitchen knives, as I was this morning. Hasn't happened recently, and given that my focus has been on handling other classes of intrusive thoughts (such as getting clobbered by a vehicle, doing inappropriate touching of others, or yelling slurs/profanities to name a few), I more or less forgot about it until I was washing a small paring knife and suddenly became super afraid that I was going to use it on my jugular.

I've calmed down after a few activities and simple passage of time, but I started wondering if I could do various exposure therapy exercises with the knives I have to reduce chances of it resurfacing at a minimum and maybe even help with my other thoughts and themes. So far I've just been holding the paring knife and a few other sharp kitchen knives I have, doing some light twirling, and even moving them closer to my body (holding horizontally at chest level and safe edge towards me; even so this generally produces the greatest anxiety which I guess is a good sign?).

I feel like I've seen posts about this before. Do people have other ideas? Has this helped you?",1,2022-03-18 13:57:06-04:00,"What you are doing is ERP, which should be done from least anxiety provoking to most and systematically. 

Write a list of 10 things you could do with knives. You've named a few above. Rate them from least troubling to most troubling. Pick one of the least troubling. 

Do it. Note your anxiety level on a scale of 1 to 10. If your anxiety barely rises, skip to the next highest item on your list.

If your anxiety spikes, note how high. Breathe through it. Stay calm and see what happens after 10 minutes. Hopefully your anxiety lessens. Repeat once or twice per day until doing so barely raises your anxiety.

You should find after a number of repetitions that your anxiety spikes lower and lower and the length of time it takes for your anxiety to return to normal is shorter and shorter.

Move to the next highest item on your list. Repeat.

The highest item should be the one that you think would cause a near panic attack. You work up to it.

By the way, refrain from doing any of your usual compulsions during these exercises. ### ",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/th9ng5/knife_exposure_ideas_tw_knives_and_kniferelated/

th48pj,"Making some progress has made me realize that my OCD was a misdirection and a coping mechanism I've been suffering from contamination OCD for a long while. Recently I've been slowly reducing my compulsions and it made me realize that my real motivation was not contamination, instead I felt like my compulsions were an indirect and subconscious way to deal with other stresses and worries that are much harder or impossible to control.

It feels like my OCD was a jail that I had voluntarily put myself in as a way to mentally protect myself. It was restricting but safe because:

1. Compulsions were an indirect way to deal with stresses, I felt that going along with them somehow helped me with my real problems, or made future problems less likely to occur.

2. Contamination is a ""fake"" problem that I can control, albeit it being time consuming and unhealthy, whereas real problems are much more complex and require more than compulsive cleaning to solve. thus compulsions served as a distraction.

3. Ultimately I knew that I was the source of my OCD, thus it was theoretically under my control, whereas a lot of my other worries are entirely outside my control. I suppose being restrained by a mental problem subconsciously felt more comfortable and masked other problems.

Despite having suffered from OCD for years I don't read or talk much about it, so I don't know how common these insights are or whether they apply to everyone or not, but I felt like putting this out there.",3,2022-03-18 11:41:33-04:00,"I‚Äôm sorry to ask such a personal question but if you are open to answering, were you ever in a abusive situation or are you currently in one?

Very regularly insecurities about being a father or husband or employee will lead to an ocd episode. Day after my daughter was born I spent an hour walking laps around the hospital ruminating. Fifteen minutes after everyone left my son‚Äôs very successful birthday party that I planned, intrusive thought slams me. 

I don‚Äôt read enough about this aspect of ocd. Maybe it‚Äôs uncommon. But I suspect that for many ocd sufferers the obsession can feel ‚Äúsafer‚Äù (even though it‚Äôs hell, it‚Äôs a hell in your head) than ‚Äúreal‚Äù anxieties.

Which means for me that addressing those deeper anxieties makes ocd easier to handle. Of course, part of it is biological, so this isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúcure,‚Äù but I think it can reduce an influence for some of us. ### I'm not sure if I'd call it an abusive situation but I had to be in a supportive role from a very early age because of family circumstances.

I've thus asked a lot of people, and I'll just briefly explain what I understood from it. Yes, normal people would have a problem with it, but the thing is, they wouldn't obsess over it for hours or even days, that won't be the only thing on their mind, they won't be afraid of falling sick or feel so disgusted that they'd go on a cleaning frenzy.

Thus, these are good ERP exercises once in a while. In ERP, you have to challenge yourself with exposures even normal people are uncomfortable doing. The whole point of it is to live with the uncertainty, there's no big harm in not washing hands after touching a toilet seat a few times. Once you're out of that anxiety zone, you can reasonably wash your hands how everyone does without obsessing.

This is because I truly try to understand the people I love. Everyone loves differently. Deep down I know that my family love me, but every now and then, especially since facing many recent adversities, I doubt their love. 

How do you feel used? What happened? ### I feel the same way, friend! I always have empathy, sometimes maybe too much to the point where my family members knows that I will never criticize their BS behavior or if they hurt me or something emotionally I always just lie and say it was fine rather than actually saying it really hurt me. Not only that, but whenever my grandma would ask me how I was doing growing up, whenever I would be honest with her and say I wasn‚Äôt feeling too god, she just gave a very contrived and generic answer. Something that you might expect a random stranger off the street to answer you with if you actually told them how you felt if they asked, ‚ÄúHow are you doing?‚Äù My Dad, I believe is partly the reason I have OCD in the first place. I realize that OCD is genetic, but also environmental too. Like the generic part is the fuse and the environmental trigger is the match that lights it. My Dad always treated me much differently than my brother growing up. When my brother did something wrong, he either didn‚Äôt get it trouble at all or got a slap on the wrist in comparison to what I got. My Dad always yelled at me as loud as he could with me even for the smallest thing. I never did drugs and never drank growing up (I still have never done either), I tried my best I could in school, and I never talked back or anything because I knew he‚Äôd yell at me. On a few occasions, I thought he would beat me. Growing up, I was helping dry the dishes and he was washing them because every Thursday we would go over my grandma‚Äôs house because my parents got divorced because my Dad cheated on my Mom with one of his coworker‚Äôs wives and lost his job as a result of that too. He was very depressed and suicidal at that time and he took a lot of his anger out of me and I was empathetic to his situation every instance. Even though I was in more advanced classes for the first time to required more homework, I had always felt guilt tripped to go with him every Thursaday and every other weekend because he would say ‚ÄúFine! You don‚Äôt want to go with me?! I‚Äôm the bad guy out of your Mom and I, right?‚Äù while shouting but in a hurt voice like his feelings were hurt, but it wasn‚Äôt personal, it was just that I needed to get my homework done and my grandma‚Äôs house was 30 minutes away one way and we stayed there for 4 hours. Not only that, but my Dad would constantly talk about what my Mom was doing to make him angry. I was very into health (and still am to a large extent) and my grandma would always try to get me to eat dessert every time I was over there. She would always say ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not gonna kill ya!‚Äù and even though I thought it would be rude to outright say ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù in a much more stern voice because I thought my Dad would yell at me and then maybe get so angry, he‚Äôd get past his breaking point and beat me. I ruined my life because I was so afraid of him that every major life decision I made was specifically with the thought in mind that ‚Äúmaybe he will go easier on me if I do this‚Äù or ‚Äúmaybe he‚Äôll be genuinely proud of me if I do this.‚Äù Playing football, almost going into the military, lending my brother a lot of money and then him taking a long time to pay it back (and then 3 months later my Dad asking me for a lot of money to buy my brother a car and I gave it to him and my brother did not fully pay me back). My Dad does has not ever brought it up again and it seems as though he genuinely does not feel bad about doing that. During covid, I tried asking him for help to be a co-signer for an apartment (my first apartment) and he said that his credit score was still bad from the divorce (that happened 10 years prior). It was only a few months after when I realized that we had a conversation about credit scores in January of 2020 and when we were talking he said his credit score was ‚Äúcloser to 800.‚Äù Not only that, he yelled at me for my brother agreeing to pay me interest for every time he missed a payment every week (which was about $50 over multiple months) even though he was the one who asked me for the money in the first place for his car. I worked hard as a gig economy driver and saved a lot of of money but my Dad and my brother took advantage of that and my mental illness which is why I lent them the money. My brother had been good at paying me smaller amounts in the past and I was afraid my Dad would yell at me if I didn‚Äôt lend him the money so I did. It messed up a lot for me because I did that. Not only that, he had said that my grandma was a part of the transaction (or that she refused to be) I he had said one or the other at the beginning of the conversation, but when I asked him to clarify by asking, ‚ÄúWait, what did you say at the beginning of the conversation about grandma being a part of this transaction?‚Äù He then took a 15 - 20 second pause before saying, ‚ÄúAre you going to help me or are you not able to help me?‚Äù Then I said, ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôll help you, I just want to know if Grandma is a part of this transaction or not and what you said at the beginning of our conversation when you first asked me. Then he took another 15 - 20 second long pause and said, ‚ÄúOkay, I have to go now, but if you‚Äôre gonna help me, you‚Äôre gonna help me, if not‚Ä¶then alright.‚Äù So he was intentionally deceitful to me too. I had confronted him 2 weeks later about him treating me differently than my brother and he just said, ‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs just a part of family‚Äù and I replied, ‚ÄúSo, you‚Äôre saying that favorites are a part of family?‚Äù And he said ‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶yeah.‚Äù So he obviously does not care about how I feel when he yells at me. After he lost his last job he went back to college and got a degree in counseling and is now a counselor on top of all of this. I feel like my father knows that he is harming me psychologically by doing what he does in yelling at me and manipulating me for money but he not only doesn‚Äôt care, he weaponizes his knowledge as a counselor against me, knowing how to manipulate me and make my life worse by yelling at me.

th27zg,"Need advice, not judgment, please So I'm just going to keep it short because at any moment the OCD attack can come and ill be stuck, and...you know the deal. So basically my first ever OCD symptoms appeared when I was \`13. It hit hard. Not a good time in my life. Ever since then I've been having so many different forms of ocd manifesting itself. Ive faced the symmetrical ocd, contamination ocd, checking ocd, touch twice, 4 times, 6 times to cancel out bad luck ocd, I had religious ocd and also reading and writing ocd(reading same line multiple times even though I already knew what it meant). Now I am facing probably the hardest or the easiest form of OCD. The reason I say that is because pure ocd is ocd in my head so i literally can't escape it sometimes. But then again, I remember back during the times when I had the physical ocd symptoms where I couldn't move from debilitating anxiety/ocd compulsions. and my god did i feel paralyed so many times that I couldn't move my lips to call for help. I'm also diagnosed with GAD, PTSD, ADHD, non-chronic depression, and Substance abuse disorder. Any way that's the background story. What's going on now is that because my last psychiatrist knew I was addictive in nature, he would avoid meds that are potentially addictive. I don't blame him. As I was going through life during the pandemic, something happened, my adhd became at its worst. At the time I didn't even know I had ADHD. The psychiatrist diagnosed me with it but he kept trying to avoid the topic for  2 reasons. 1, my addictive nature to seek drugs to ease my pain. 2. He's one of those psychiatrists that is a ocd specialist and never prescribed adhd meds to anyone before. After 4 months of suffering and taking action myself, I decided to go to a new psychiatrist and in the first appointment, the new psychiatrist straight up told me I should have been on ADHD medication already for awhile now. I get that its hard to deal with patients with substance abuse disorder but delaying treatment for one of my issues just made my mental health worse. After that appointment, I went back to my previous doctor for another appointment because I have attachment issues and it was hard to leave him. Plus, it felt like we were bros for decades when its actually been 2 years. Unfortunately, he said, I should go to the other psychiatrist. Now this, this is when things start getting bad when I thought it was going to be the best (because stimulants!!!!!) So hear me out. During the pandemic and my childhood, my ADHD was at its worse, (sleeping in the brace position because of how restless my body was, constantly shaking my legs seeking for stimulation, playing a game, after 3 minutes bored, went to netflix, after 3 minutes bored, had to put on music, play 2 accounts of a game at once, and put on a movie on the big screen all at the same time and still everything seemed so boring and frustrating).  it got so bad that I remember it felt like everything around me had no meaning and that life was pointless and nothing was interesting, I can't really describe the feeling in words but people with severe ADHD would probably know what I mean. Once college opened physically again after the pandemic, things started to get better in terms of ADHD. It was still pretty bad however as, I would be playing 3 games at once with music on, not being able to sit in my chair for longer than 3 minutes without my body going crazy. I would even read a few words from my textbook and would drift off every 5 seconds no matter how much motivation and will I had, So let's get back to the new psychiatrist. Of course, after being professionally diagnosed with ADHD, my dumbass brain being me saw this as an opportunity to take advantage of ''free highs'' instead of taking advantage to get better. I exaggerated, bsed my way, lied about serious my symptoms actually were. I would act terrified of stimulants always playing the innocent dude whos scared of psychiatric stimulants. I would always question its safety. I would always be like ''it has the word amphetamine, doesn't that mean its chemical formula is similar to methamphetamine?????'' I was basically playing the doctor. I would constantly say how I feel nothing on 50mg of Adderall just to get a dosage increase. Now I'm on 90mg of Adderall, and my OCD HAS BEEN THE WORST ITS EVER BEEN. I'm going through hell, and it's all my fault. Every single few minutes or seconds a horror OCD attacks. Probably would have suicided by now if I didn't take my antidepressants for OCD. I tried taking lower doses of aderall even 20mg of Adderall but it still hurts my ocd. I also have a around 60-70% tolerance to my antidepressant if i had to guess on top of my head. So, things are not looking good. I know once I tell the truth to my new psychiatrist that I'm addictive in nature or the Aderalls are hurting my OCD, its over, no more aderall high, and no chance to sell them either. I don't even need the money from selling it, I literally only think about that because so many people would jump at the chance to get an aderall script just to sell them, And If im void from the Adderall's, Ill feel like I just stabbed my own back. But here's the things, the aderall is making my OCD worse and and feel like hell, but it also makes me feel stimulated and feel normal. For example, i dont get bored or annoyed by anything I did before such as having to do the most simple tasks such as using the bathroom or waiting only 2 mins for the train. Before it was a struggle, now it feels like something I should do when I need to do it. I guess I feel normal in terms of dopamine levels. There are some good days where i take extra ocd meds and continue with the aderall and I get so focused and high  my grades even improve. But it's not improving in the right way if you know what I mean. I know I'm about to be shit on and called a disgrace etc, weak, and pathetic but I beg you, please please please do not judge atm as I already hate myself more than you could ever. All I want is advice and help. Thank you so much to anyone who takes the time to read my post.",8,2022-03-18 10:10:08-04:00,"No judgement!

Addiction is just as much of an illness as OCD or ADHD.

For one, don't feel bad or like you should be ashamed. People make mistakes and this is hardly the worst crime that anybody has ever committed, and substance abuse is not easy overcome.

Be proud of the fact that you're willing to admit that you might have a problem, that takes courage. You aren't a disgrace or a failure, you're a human being who is struggling with an illness and that's normal.

Aderall is not the only medication that will work for ADHD, so don't worry, even if you have to get weened off, there are effective alternative medications and therapies that you can always try.

I would make a point of talking to your *new* doctor about your habit and being completely honest. I know that that's easier said than done, but there is no shame in seeking help for addictions. Even the best of people get hooked drugs. They can and will help you make a plan to transition to another treatment method without going into withdrawal, and hopefully find something that actually helps you. Psychiatrists and physicians help patients with addictions all of the time.

Next, try to return to your prescribed dose. Again, this probably isn't easy, and if you can't then your doctor can always help.

Additionally, I would recommend looking into local Narcotics Anonymous programs. They're a great, non-judgemental and supportive environment where you can discuss your struggles with other current and former addicts, and it really does help to not feel alone when you're struggling with substances. They're often completely free and don't require a membership, and mental health services will usually be present during meetings.

I will definitely try to make the next steps into getting better, I'm just scared once I admit my addiction tendencies, the stimulants will be taken away and I will hate it or regret the fact that I can't have them in my possession anymore for the rest of my life. It sounds so scary but I know I need to do it to get better, but at the same time, I feel like it might even make treatment not adequate. By that I mean, because my last psychiatrist knew that I have addiction tendencies when the Luvox was losing its effect because of tolerance, he wouldn't give me Anafranil which is not even a controlled substance but he said he won't give it because if I take too much I could die I guess. He was looking out for my best interest but at the same time, I cant help but think it would have probably helped my OCD during that really stressful time and my grades and mental health wouldn't suffer as much. I really feel like I'm stuck. But for now I will try to calm down on the drugs that are harming me, and go into narcotics anonymous as you suggested. I hope you dont mind but is it okay if you tell me where you're from or at least which state or country you live in because my OCD jumps to conclusions and thinks that maybe this person might be one of my past bullies which would be horrific but I know that there's a .00001% chance you might be a past bully.

I‚Äôm in Saskatchewan lmao, so have fun looking up where that is on a map.

There‚Äôs always better treatment, you haven‚Äôt screwed yourself out of anything. Even if the aderall gets taken away, there are other treatments that work just as well, and you will find something and feel better.

Don‚Äôt feel bad, your doctor will help and you‚Äôll get back to feeling normal, and you‚Äôll find a new treatment that works for you.

th48a7,"Can OCD make you obsessed with people? I‚Äôve had OCD basically my entire life. I am 24 now, and my OCD mainly consists of intrusive thoughts of harm and negative thoughts like ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a worthless piece of shit, nobody likes you‚Äù. I started a new job recently at a bigger company than I‚Äôve ever worked for before and so there‚Äôs some new territory along with it. There‚Äôs a girl who works here that is my age and a few weeks ago we started going to the gym together (which is really big for me, since I have never gone before out of anxiety) and we talk casually. We‚Äôve talked about guys she‚Äôs interested in and she‚Äôs told me she‚Äôs on dating apps. 

I think she‚Äôs attractive but we don‚Äôt have much in common. She also lives hours away from me and our office. I‚Äôve thought about trying to get her number or asking her out, but at the end of the day I don‚Äôt think we much in common. The problem is, I can‚Äôt stop obsessing that she ‚Äúhates me‚Äù and thinks I‚Äôm creepy and furthermore, that all women think I‚Äôm creepy and I‚Äôll die alone. I messaged her yesterday about a show she said I should watch after I watched it, and she‚Äôs like ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs great, right? I‚Äôm glad you enjoy it!‚Äù And I wanted to talk about it more so I messaged her ‚ÄúDo you have any favorite characters?‚Äù To which she didn‚Äôt respond, but she came in the office later so she may have been driving and didn‚Äôt respond. She didn‚Äôt respond to the message ever. And of course I‚Äôm obsessing over that.. Is this par for the course for OCD? I swear I just want to be friends but I‚Äôm fused with the thought that if I talk to her anymore, I‚Äôll creep her out.",4,2022-03-18 11:41:02-04:00,"If you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please do not hesitate to talk to someone.

th3w0v,"im feeling absolutely insane my intrusive thoughts have gotten a lot worse these few years(mine are usually about dying, some type of medical emergency i cant control etc). Usually im able to just say so what? to myself when im having these thoughts, but recently whenever i have an episode i dissociate like a madlad, scream and feel like passing out it literally feels like im going insane. never felt this kind of horror before. like its normal for me to feel woozy and dissociate whenever i do an exposure but now its to a whole different level.

i also have asd+adhd. the medication i used to take is really hard to get where i live now so the overthinking+compulsion cycle is fueling my ocd. the anti anxiety meds dont help. ive been diagnosed with ocd and other shit for 8 years now but i still struggle with everyday life. never been able to work/attend school in a normal way. it doesnt help that its hard to get help where i currently live, but i dont wanna be an insane person hermit forever.

I always see on job applications where it asks if you have or have had a disability and OCD or anxiety are always on the list, so I disclose that info. But the thing is, mine is so severe that I can't leave my house every day. I found remote work and take classes online so it works fine and usually just order groceries through the app to pick up so I don't have to wander through the store. It's not that I'm afraid I just literally can't do it.

tgsecf,"I‚Ä¶. Am not sure where to turn I am a 23 year old female and I guess I just need reassurance if maybe I should get tested for ocd. I never once in my life have thought I could have this until recently. I have an amazing boyfriend for 2 years now and since the end of January, I‚Äôve been getting guilty thoughts that I‚Äôve cheated with guy friends I use to talk to. I don‚Äôt talk to them anymore and have told my bf about them so I‚Äôm not sure why this is bothering me so much. I started to become obsessed with these thoughts to the point that last week, I started to get sexual thoughts of a guy friend and now I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it, I feel super guilty as if I have had pleasure from these thoughts. But I feel so disgusted by them and would never want to cheat with on my bf. It‚Äôs to the point where my mind is constantly thinking if I even love my bf or if I‚Äôm attracted to him. I try to distract myself but the feeling is still there. And now that I look back on the past, I do realize that i am constantly overthinking like if it‚Äôs not one thing, it‚Äôs another, like something my boyfriend did that got me mad and I will think about it for months and feel sad. But these thoughts have recently consumed my life and not sure what to do. I just want to feel like myself again and be happy. Sometimes I think I‚Äôm overthinking and shouldn‚Äôt get tested and it‚Äôs just my mind but it‚Äôs getting very overbearing now.",7,2022-03-17 23:43:29-04:00,"Hi, so I read the first line of this and thought I wrote it myself. I'm also 23f and have finally decided that tomorrow morning is the morning I'm really going to call an office and start the process of getting tested/diagnosed for what I believe is OCD.  the symptoms ebb and flow constantly so I've always convinced myself its nothing and that I'm lying to myself about intrusive thoughts etc. The only way we'll know is if we just get tested and learn more about our brain, and if it isnt OCD knowing that will help narrow down the problem. Good luck on your journey and I'll part with some advice that has helped me recently ""Your intrusive thoughts are often distressing fears over things you would NEVER actually do, thats why they are stressful"" we obsess over things that do not align with our values, hence why its so stressful. love and peace, friend ‚ù§Ô∏è ### Well, this could be OCD, it might not be. Either way, it sounds like it's weighing pretty heavily on your mind. I think it'd be a good idea to talk to a professional - a therapist is probably the most accessible. And talk to them about your concerns with OCD.
My therapist was a able to diagnose me pretty easily after getting to know me a bit and asking me some screening questions.
One way or another, I'm really rooting for you! You deserve to find peace of mind and to be happy with yourself and your partner. You can do this! ### Wow‚Ä¶ I resonate so so hard with this post. I‚Äôm sorry for how much this is consuming your life and how much suffering you‚Äôre going through with these thoughts. I feel you on what it‚Äôs like to go through this kind of constant doubt about whether or not you love your partner, and getting sexual intrusive thoughts about other people and feeling like your cheating. It‚Äôs debilitating and feels absolutely devastating because you doubt the person you love the most. With my partner, I had these crippling doubts of whether or not I actually loved them, checking mentally over and over again whether I felt anything when I was with them, playing memories over and over again trying to capture a certain moment that would give me proof that I did indeed love them. I resonate with this so much!

These definitely sound like they could fall under obsessive-compulsive symptoms! From what you described about it consuming your life, I definitely think that you should consider seeking out treatment. Once ANYTHING becomes so debilitating that it‚Äôs affecting your life in this way means that you should seek out treatment, and not just for OCD but for anything that‚Äôs bearing down on your life! I would highly suggest looking into the International OCD Foundation (https://iocdf.org), since they have a feature where you can search for OCD-specialized professionals nearest to you! Apart from anything relating to financing the appointment, you have nothing to lose from seeking out treatment with someone who‚Äôs OCD-specialized! Though not about OCD, I had a similar experience with when I was trying to figure out my gender and thought i might be trans. Though I eventually figured out I‚Äôm not trans, I met with a gender identity therapist and worked with him exploring my identity, and through that figured out that I wasn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs a bit of a tangent, but just a way of saying that even if you‚Äôre not sure, it‚Äôs always best to talk with a professional to truly find out!

Also, I would recommend checking out r/ROCD, which is the Relationship OCD-subtype subreddit, and your post very, very much matches that sort of content. I do also want to state that the subtype subreddits (as well as this one) are good for kinda exploring and relating, but they can also become reassurance rabbit holes, and can also be quite sad as well. That being said, just thought that I would link it because I think you might resonate with the content there!

Hope this helped a bit :D ### I'd say get tested just to get evaluated. Couldn't hurt ### Thank you so much for the advice! I felt relief reading this knowing that I‚Äôm not alone. It‚Äôs good you‚Äôre going to get tested üòä I wish you luck and peace in your mind ‚ò∫Ô∏è ### Thank you üòä you are very kind, I am definitely going to ask for help because I deserve to be happy! üòä thanks for the kind and encouraging words, really appreciate it üôÇ ### Aw thank you!!

tggaj6,"Zoloft? Any one take it for OCD? Success stories?? I‚Äôm just starting 100mg after being on 50mg for close to 6 weeks. I was on Fluvoxamine for years, but I stopped taking it(along with my other meds 4ish years ago) because I thought my main problem was my alcoholism. Big mistake. Got back on all the meds, including Fluvoxamine, but Fluvoxamine was never the same. I was told by my doctor that it may not work the same once off it and then back on. That was my experience. The last 4 years have not been the same. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm hopeful Zoloft does it‚Äôs thing and get back on track. One day at a time!",102,2022-03-17 14:05:59-04:00,"I take 75mg of zololoft and it helps! ERP is still hard and the obsessions aren‚Äôt gone, but I‚Äôm not depressed and anxious 24/7 anymore which makes things as a whole easier to deal with. My only complaints is that it does lower my libido and make me often nauseous ### I've been on it for about three and half months now. It's definitely helped with concentration, anxiety, and depression but my intrusive thoughts are still there, just not in my face like they used to be if that makes sense. I'm doing ERP therapy now so I'm hoping it will give me the tools in need to ride the wave of intrusive thoughts. It's tough, but I've had some good days which is nice. ### I‚Äôve been on Zoloft two different times. Both times I a have noticed a night and day difference. It takes a while for me about 2 months, but therapy is what really helped. ### I have been taking 200 mgs of Sertraline (Zoloft) for 4 years and the difference has been amazing. My issues are with intrusive thoughts and I have only had like 1-2 small episodes since starting the meds. I can‚Äôt imagine ever going off of them at this point. ### I'm on 50mg of Sertraline, I was only taking 25mg at first because I was concerned it seemed to trigger my dr/dp disorder the first few weeks. It took me almost a year to move up to 50mg. 

I don't know how to tell if it ""works"" because I'm too mentally ill and still struggle everyday and probably will forever. But I deffo notice when I accidentally miss a dose.

I've tried quite a few SSRI's, I think sertraline is my fave so far bc it helps with sleep. ### I‚Äôve been taking it for nearly 2 months and it still hasn‚Äôt really changed a thing ### [deleted] ### Been on Zoloft 50mg (sometimes more or less, depends on how I am doing and stuff) for +2 years, severe OCD + Asperger‚Äôs Syndrome as well. It helps a lot, but it hasn‚Äôt cured all of my symptoms because many of them are interlinked with autism. As far as OCD‚Äôs concerned, it really helped. No bad effects on libido like many people say, but I have always had a high libido so maybe that‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt notice anything. Good luck! It takes a few days/weeks for effects/action to start, but it‚Äôs a great medicine with little to no side effects. ### I‚Äôm taking Zoloft.

Long story short:

- obviously anxious af and also had mild OCD, so doctor gave me Zoloft
- took Zoloft for a few months, when felt better and eventually stopped taking it due to a bunch of life problems
- Biggest mistake of my life
- Extremely severe OCD for weeks and months all alone in a foreign country with low insight and panic attacks and basically was really bad
- Back with my fam, back on Zoloft, still recovering, but Zoloft is Godsent and I won‚Äôt ever EVER stop taking it EVER ever again. EVER ever again. Zoloft is my life-saving drug. My one and only hope. Without it I can‚Äôt live. I will never stop taking it ever again.


- Success story for Zoloft I guess???


Obviously I‚Äôm still me but now the anxiety is not debilitating and the severe OCD is gone. So that‚Äôs a huge success for me. Only 1,5 months in though with the Zoloft since I restarted taking it. ### I was diagnosed with OCD at 6 years old, and Zoloft was the first med I was prescribed at 8 years old. I took it for almost 14 years straight, upping and lowering my dose as needed as I grew and as OCD fluctuated. My highest dose was 150 and I stayed on that for at least 6-7 years. Luckily I had minimal/no side effects, and I believe that it saved my life. I‚Äôve been off it for a couple years because my OCD has been manageable without meds, but I definitely would say it was really helpful for me! ### Zoloft worked absolute wonders for me! To me it felt like I didn‚Äôt even have OCD anymore and I felt like myself again. I truly couldn‚Äôt believe how much of a miracle worker it was. I was only on it for a little less than a year and I went off it because I was all good! ### It helped me a lot BUT it nuked my (female) libido within about a week. I could no longer even achieve orgasm. Therapist moved me to mirtazapine instead and that also killed my libido AND made me gain a ton of weight. I say exercise, meditation, nutrition. Make sure you're getting enough magnesium, vit B, vit D, omega 3s. ### it worked for me for about a year and a half at ~250mgs before it just. stopped working. which happened with one other drug too that i can‚Äôt remember the name of. but it *did* work for a while, so it was worth it. i didn‚Äôt have any side effects other than when we raised dosages. ### I‚Äôm on Zoloft for Anxiety and OCD. It takes time but after a while I realized I don‚Äôt have to do the rituals as much, the nightmares don‚Äôt happen every night and I even started having days where the intrusive thoughts are almost gone. It‚Äôs different for different people but I hope it helps you like it helped me. ### Zoloft helped me feel the closest to normal that I‚Äôve ever felt. ### I‚Äôm on Citalopram/Celexa having tried both Zoloft and Setraline. I prefer this one and notice slight improvements in OCD symptoms. ### I started on Zoloft 18 months ago....definitely made the difference and I felt good but I was experiencing side effects such as daily 30 minute yawning bouts, and jaw grinding. The worst side effect which made me speak to my GP about changing was that I was not able to ejaculate (sorry for the info) and found it extremely frustrating.

I moved over to Mirtazapine 12 months ago, starting on 15mg and now on 30mg. I have zero side effects and seems to help me alot - I only notice that my sex drive is much lower but certainly doesnt bother me as much as Zoloft did.

However, your side effects for Zoloft might be very different so I hope it works for you :) ### It sucked dropped after a month. Side effects intolerable. ### I take 100mg and it‚Äôs been a game changer for me. Feel like I still have catastrophic thoughts but I can recognize them as being ridiculous now and they don‚Äôt bother me. It made the angel on my shoulder stronger than the devil whereas before it was vice versa. Highly reccomend ### I take 250. It's been the only thing that helps. I must've tried over ten different meds over the years... ### I am using 150mg clomipramine a TCA drug!
Works exstremly well for my OCD!
I did use zoloft early on and works ok for me. ### OCD was very bad for me in early 2020.  I was prescribed 150mg of Sentraline (Zoloft) around this time and I improved a great deal.  I am considering asking for an increase in dosage because the OCD has gotten worse the past month, but the medicine has definitely helped me these last two years. ### I‚Äôve been on the maximum amount for a couple years now and while there are some downs, it‚Äôs been pretty stable. I mean, my ocd is never going away, but Zoloft definitely helps ### Zoloft made my OCD so much worse ### they just recently took me off of wellbutrin (for depression and off label adhd) and put me on zoloft! too recent to tell much so far. 

im diagnosed with severe gad but not ocd (yet, i very clearly have instrusive thoughts and compulsions for them but i havent been able to get a psychiatrist or decent therapist), my heart rate has decreased back to generally normal but my ocd symptoms are stoll fairly present (bear in mind im still trying to find a therapist so ive got nothing to combat this much atm).

glad to come across this thread rn tho! ### I have been on Zoloft for nearly 3 years now and feel a lot better. I definitely still have ups and downs but it helps me manage! ### I took 100mg of Zoloft for about 18 mos. It helped a LOT. It didn't get rid of my intrusive thoughts but made me feel more calm, stable, and present overall, and when the thoughts did pop up, the intensity was like 1/4 as much. Which in turn made it easier for me to develop the 'muscle memory' of executing E/RP and similar tactics.

I noticed a slight increase in symptoms after going off but it's been manageable so far and I'm still way better than I used to be. Granted, in that time, I also made some pretty significant, positive lifestyle changes that also probably helped. ### It‚Äôs good for me ### I take 75mg and it helps a lot ### I've been on it for about 6 months and I've found that its been working better for intrusive thoughts than my last med (Paxil, which I had been on for 6 years.) I started at 25 mg and have slowly increased to 100 mg. I hope it works well for you too :) ### luvox made me feel totally crappy. only took it for about 9 days because it made me constantly nauseous. switched to zoloft and i‚Äôm at 175mg now. it helps a lot with the intrusive thoughts and compulsions but doesn‚Äôt completely eliminate them. hasnt helped a ton for depression but it‚Äôs better than nothing for sure. word of advice: take it at night. it will probably make you feel drowsy ### I did. It worked great drug. Takes a bit to kick in but it's worth it ### Zoloft was my first SSRI that I took when my condition came to a head in my teens. I was on it for seven years with virtually no side effects. All of a sudden, in a couple of weeks, I found that my brain, which was totally infested with irrational fears and compulsions and paranoia, was my own. It was extremely liberating and it changed my entire life. I did also begin seeing a talk therapist at the time, though, and I do recommend a therapist at minimum, but particularly one who is well-versed in OCD and cognitive behavioral therapy. Having someone who can help you learn to see through your intrusive thoughts and manage your reactions to them is key. 

The side effects I did experience were an emotional dulling effect that wasn‚Äôt really an issue until I went from 25 mg to 50 mg and then to 100 mg at the end of my time on it. There is also the libido suppression and the sexual numbing, but compared to any of the other SSRIs I‚Äôve been on, it was by far the easiest to manage on Zoloft. As someone who is excessively paranoid about weight gain with every drug, Zoloft also never really gave me any problems with weight loss and never caused me to gain any extra fat. 

My only regret was when I tried to get off it cold turkey and then trying a rapid, month-long taper. That messed me up more than anything. You seem to have already had a similar experience with moving too fast with discontinuation, though, so you‚Äôd probably already be cautious in that regard. 

Best of luck, OP. We are all rooting for you. I really think you can find some real and lasting comfort here. ### I‚Äôm on 200mg Zoloft daily, have been for about 6 years. Has done wonders for me. My brain is SO MUCH LESS ‚ÄúSTICKY‚Äù!!! ### I take 100mg of Zoloft and 300mg of Wellbutrin and it has been great for my OCD. The Zoloft I started first and I noticed an ease in OCD symptoms with just that. It felt like it helped give my brain the energy to direct myself away from cyclical thoughts. ### For me it made things a lot worse, but I respond weird to medication in general. Hope it works for you, good luck üòÅ ### Yes. I do. A new doc added welbutrin recently, and it's working well together. ### I take Zoloft. It does seem to help some? I mean I still have ocd, which sucks, but I haven‚Äôt been getting the panic attacks I used to lately. So that‚Äôs nice. ### Zoloft has made a massive difference for me! I‚Äôve been on a pretty high dose for the past three years. I‚Äôve found that it helps most with compulsive behaviors‚Äî especially things that became routine parts of everyday, ‚Äúnormal‚Äù functioning (e.g. counting while eating) ‚Äî and, although it definitely doesn‚Äôt get rid of obsessive thoughts, it helps me identify when they‚Äôre irrational and resist acting on them.
To echo what a lot of others have said ‚Äî it hasn‚Äôt ‚Äúfixed‚Äù me, but it‚Äôs helped me as I try to ‚Äúfix‚Äù myself. ### i take 250mg zoloft in combination with a mood stabilizer (i have a co-diagnosis of bipolar) and it works great for me!! honestly changed my life, both in terms of intrusive thoughts / compulsions and in terms of general escalating anxiety day to day. have been on it for four years now and had tried just about every other type of medication before going on it - i really hope it works for you! ### I‚Äôm on 100 mg, have anxiety, OCD, depression. It‚Äôs done wonders for me ### I‚Äôve been on Zoloft for about a year and just upped my dose from 50mg to 75mg. Honestly, it‚Äôs mostly been effective for depression, not so much OCD or anxiety, but I‚Äôm hoping a higher dose will help. ### Zoloft is the second antidepressant I tried. Great results! Currently I take 100mg. I'm still kind of a neurotic person but my major intrusive thought themes have calmed down big time, social anxiety has gone down and I feel like a completely new person. ### Everything is different for everyone try it and find out. Our experiences won‚Äôt reflect yours. Just do yourself and everyone around you a favour and avoid Venlafaxine, that drug is dangerous I have no idea how it‚Äôs prescribed. ###  I used to take it for my ocd but after a while it made it worse ### But to be fair I also have pandas syndrome ### I definitely found it helped! But I had my best results with Prozac and Buspar together. The Zoloft was great, just didn't fully take care of things and my drs felt I could get more out of a different med. ### Zoloft helped me. My kid too.  It somehow makes the horrible clanging of ocd a somewhat bearable annoying song.  It‚Äôs like a muffler of sound for me ### I took Zoloft for 1.5 years for diagnosed OCD and anxiety.  For the majority of that time I had frequent diarrhea and severe acid reflux. I eventually decided to try something new, and was prescribed Pristiq (Desvenlafaxine). Been on the new meds for nearly a year with zero side effects. ### 150mg and i can confidently say it helps with intrusive thoughts. I haven‚Äôt been diagnosed with OCD but i definitely have some OCD tendencies + depression and anxiety ### I would love to chat with you individually because I had to self diagnose with OCD after years of dealing with compulsions and no one explaining to me what was going on. I dabbled in meds but never gave them long enough shot because I don‚Äôt have patience to wait through side effects for some hopeful potential benefit. Meanwhile I‚Äôve been drinking too much alcohol and taking Xanax. #suffering ### I take zoloft for OCD and my psychiatrist keeps increasing the dosage to treat anxiety.  Seems like it doesnt work for anxiety however does wonders for depression.  I wish I could get my anxiety under control now.  Started meditation practices about a month ago and now I am just more aware of how fast my bad thoughts race and how long I'll ruminate.  I have to work hard every second to stop the thought then try to replace it with a positive one instead (sometimes war) which is exhausting and caused a full blown panic attack in public. ### I‚Äôm just gonna throw it here. 

Not sure if I‚Äôm in the minority, but i think western psychiatric meds are overrated and have given me a ton of side effects, like massive weight gain, poor memory and lethargy, which have made me depressed as hell and have negligible impact on my healing from OCD. I cannot even concentrate on my uni studies for an extended period of time and we all know know how demanding college education is. 

Then again, it‚Äôs just based off my personal experience. The trade off mentioned by medical professionals like ‚Äúoh would you rather be fat or have intense OCD‚Äù just doesn‚Äôt sit well with me - at all. It is disrespectful and condescending. The entire impasse just makes me even more depressed and hopeless. ### Sadly the only thing that helped me drs refuse to prescribe ### I'm on 75mg. I was prescribed it years ago but never took it regularly. I also drank a lot in college so it probably wouldn't have worked anyway. I'm 11 months sober and haven't missed a day with my meds in nearly as long and I can honestly say I've never felt this comfortable in my own mind. I still have OCD and some days are hard, but it's much more manageable and I feel a lot more clear, motivated, and safe. I have so much more space in my mind for things other than ruminating. ### SSRIs never worked for me. I needed a really small dose of Abilify. ### That didn't work for me at all. In fact it made me feel worse.  None of the drugs they tried me on did, UNTILL ANAFRONIL! üòç That drug üíØ WORKS for extreme OCD. And the mental health clinic I went to said I was one of the worst cases they ever seen with the condition. 
 However I must warm that out of the 4 years I was on it I have very little memory of that time in my life. Almost like I had a form of amnesia or something. But at the time if was great to have it erase my every thought. Because I at least couldn't keep repeating and go over them over and over and so on. My memory went back to normal after I went off. The only reason I went off it was because It's hella expensive now. ### It's working very well for my ocd. But unfortunately developed sexual side effects and tinnitus ### I get it. No med is perfect but if it‚Äôs helping it‚Äôs helping. Thank you! What‚Äôs ERP by the way? ### That‚Äôs cool to hear. It sounds realistic. It‚Äôs unrealistic to think it all works perfectly, right? I‚Äôm going to look into ERP too ### This really helps. Thank you! ### That‚Äôs encouraging. What you refer to as episodes I call moments. I think. Like, getting stuck on something I was going to do or was thinking about. I currently have 2-3 a day but hope the Zoloft will help ### I‚Äôm on the same dose, just curious have you noticed a change in your weight at all? I always read conflicting things online about how it affects weight ### I appreciate this. The struggle is real. I‚Äôm mentally ill too and 90% of time I am hopeful it will be rectified. I think it will, but boy there are moments and days where I feel helpless. It sense it in you that you‚Äôre hopeful too. Keep on keepin‚Äô on! ### Same here ### Could be you need a higher dosage ### When I started, it took me months to get used to it.  It wasnt terrible side effects but I felt off/tired for a long time before it finally built up and evened out.  The good part about this is, if you miss a dose, it's not noticeable. ### Super helpful. Thank you! Happy for you that you got through those tough times.

One day at a time and you will live the life beyond your wildest dreams. ### Exposure and Response Prevention therapy. It‚Äôs used to treat OCD. ### I used to take Zoloft. It helped with Depression for sure, but made my OCD/anxiety worse. I finally switched to luvox. I was taking 200mg a day zoloft. ### Yeah, I feel like OCD is like having any chronic illness like diabetes. You're always going to have it, it's just about finding the right tools to deal with it. The right medication and coping mechanisms through therapy are the goal to get there. Good luck! ### I use NOCD for my erp and I like it. I switched therapists twice before I found one I liked but it was easy to switch! ### I also see a therapist once a week which has also helped but I know not everyone has the time/money/insurance for that. ### I have gained weight but I also started taking it around the time I began having kids so I have never known if the weight was caused by the meds or the pregnancies, unfortch. ### I don‚Äôt feel like there‚Äôs much of weight gain. I‚Äôm currently off work for a month and was wondering if that might happen. I‚Äôve been able to eat pretty despite having more time on my hands. I do have cravings but I can‚Äôt say they‚Äôre any different than when I wasn‚Äôt on Zoloft ### Same. Made things worse ### I think some people respond to SSRIs as if that was the missing piece. Like, that‚Äôs all they needed to finally become themselves. I have no regrets. The only regret I likely would of had not seeking help when I knew there was something wrong. I had no idea what it was but I knew it was time. This whole thing is a process. A lot of trial and error but there are solutions. The key is to keep going. If something doesn‚Äôt work it does not mean another thing won‚Äôt. Keep moving forward. People with mental illness are special. Treated, and the sky‚Äôs the limit. Attitude is a big attribute. I believe in God and believe that life is ALWAYS working for us, not against us. That said, the struggles are all in place to build us into the extraordinary people we are meant to be. People who tackle mental illness are miracles and these miracles go on to help others turn into miracles. So, along with a handful of other things I deal with it‚Äôs the best thing that‚Äôs ever happened to me ### I didn‚Äôt have any regrets, personally! I think the only thing for me was that when I started dating for the first time in my late teens, I didn‚Äôt have much of a sex drive. When I got off Zoloft at 22, that came back to normal! I think that maybe the Zoloft affected that as I was growing up/going through puberty, because I didn‚Äôt have any interest in dating at all during my high school years. It‚Äôs unclear whether that was because of the meds or just that I was a late bloomer in general, but I definitely wouldn‚Äôt say it was a problem for me because I didn‚Äôt have a sense of missing out on anything! Obviously that‚Äôs not a concern for a kid, but it‚Äôs the only thing I can thing of over the years that I was taking it, and I only really noticed it around the time that I stopped taking it. On the whole though, I really do think Zoloft saved my life. It certainly had a positive impact on my OCD. It can be a bit of trial and error to find something that works well for each person, and sometimes SSRIs don‚Äôt help that much either. 

One thing that I did do was something called GeneSight, which was a genetic test that looked at how my body metabolizes certain meds. I didn‚Äôt have anything of note on the test, but it certainly gave my parents peace of mind that I wasn‚Äôt going to be taking a med that had a higher risk of side effects/poor metabolism. I‚Äôm not sure about the price or accessibility of that test, but my psychiatrist gave it to me. ### Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs chronic, but then again it‚Äôs my conviction. Guess it means different things to everyone ### Right on. I do as well. Just getting started and noticed it‚Äôs helping. Slowly but surely I guess. The beast of ocd has been ruling my mind for decades. It‚Äôs going to take time I suspect ### Unfortunately, yes it will and if you‚Äôre anything like I was you‚Äôre probably thinking that this shit will never end even when people tell you it will. I really didn‚Äôt see a light at the end of the tunnel there for awhile. I also have Bipolar 2 and my mental health has been a lifelong struggle; started taking Prozac back in the late 90s and been on so many different antidepressants (amongst other things) since then but I can honestly say the Zoloft has been the best thing I have ever taken for my issues. Stay strong, friend. You‚Äôre doing everything you can at the moment. ### I appreciate that! I too am Bipolar 2 and take a few meds for that(Lamotrigine and Lithium). As I continue to observed myself throughout the years I feel OCD is the one that kicks my ass the most. Depression too actually. Ha! Yes, the depression side of Bipolar had done a number on me BUT, I‚Äôm in this to win this so to speak. I‚Äôm optimistic I‚Äôll be on the right cocktail. 

Again, thank you for your encouragement! ### No prob, dude. Best of luck. ### ",45,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tggaj6/zoloft_any_one_take_it_for_ocd_success_stories/

th1tqz,"My gender (content warnings, nsfw, dysmorphia, fetishes, figuring out my indentity) This is a long one.

Where do I even start.
First off, it all started when I was younger. I remember watching a film called stardust and a man get transformed into a lady. I think that was one of the first times I was exposed to transgender transformation stuff.
I would start to crossdress when my parents were out and I had an e***tion everytime but I didn't want it so I could continue changing. Then I found transformation stuff on youtube, I watched it a few times too. At one point I came to the conculsion that it was a f*tish.
I kept coming back to it and I stopped crossdressing but I still looked at the transformation stuff. God I'm gonna to hate myself for saying this. I m*****bated to it. alot. I also listened to mtf subliminals alot. I fantasied about it. 2019 and before I would look up stuff about transitioning. It gave me a goal, I like the idea of the process. It's not like losing weight, it felt completely different.

2020 comes rolling around and I was fine, I was happy with my gender. But at some point in 2020 I wanted to practice a voice (2020 was the time when I had a mental breakdown about germs if that is any important.)  I convinced myself into it and I thought I was transgender, I was thinking about it alot, once I had a dream about me having a feminine voice.
Hell at one point I discovered that I wasn't and I was upset which made me more confused, I think it's because I believed in it for so long and was commited to it. I grew my hair out for gods sake. After that I was questioning myself alot and I was always trying to manipulate the answer to being ""yes I'm transgender"" and even though the answer was no alot of the time. 
Whenever I saw myself on faceapp with masculine features I forced myself not to like it. I sometimes force myself not to like me being masculine at home and stuff. I shave my legs even though I don't need too. I don't like shaving my face. I drew myself as a girl once but I didn't feel comfortable with it. 

1*
Once my family were talking about me looking like a girl and I was saying stuff like ""do I?"" constantly because I wanted a ""yes"" or something, I think I was doing it to get an e**ction to feel good?

(I'm not proud of that at all, 2020 was a shite year for me and my ocd and my ocd before it was f*cking awful which is an entirely different story altogether.) 

Recently I was walking into a building and someone was holding the door open. I said thank you, (I was kind of looking down and have long hair) Got into the building and family member says ""Did anyone one else think it was weird when she called me hen?"" (scottish term for woman) I thought she said sweetheart but even then I felt kind of happy? and then I felt like a little mad? then was I like ""Guess I pass"" kind of a passing comment to myself.
I'm comfortable with my gender and I have nothing ""fun"" (if that's even the right word which it's probably not.) think about, but why did I feel like that?


What the hell was all of that?

tgsiwp,"I‚Äôm afraid of my ‚Äúwhat if I cheated on my boyfriend‚Äù thoughts I am F22. I have been best friends with my boyfriend since spring 2019 and we started dating November 2021. I love him so very much.

But then I ended up befriending internet friends from a Facebook group. One of them I began finding attractive and started to have a crush on. I began to feel guilt for feeling so and looked up ‚Äúis it normal to like someone while in a relationship?‚Äù. Most of the answers were yes. 

I knew I would never cheat or do anything to hurt my boyfriend. But next thing I new, I found myself having urges to tell the internet friend I liked him/found him attractive. 

It grew so strong that I began to explain to my internet friend that I suffered from relationship ocd and that I was afraid of finding people attractive while dating. He told me that was normal and then I told him‚Ä¶.

‚ÄúSo you wouldn‚Äôt think it is weird if I said I found you attractive?‚Äù And the internet friend said ‚Äúno‚Äù. That‚Äôs when I told him ‚ÄúI think you are attractive, but I have a boyfriend.‚Äù Meaning I think he is attractive but I would never do anything. I told him to get some relief not to cheat. 

I gave into the urge to get some anxiety out and I became relieved‚Ä¶.that‚Äôs when the thought of ‚ÄúDid I just cheat?‚Äù Came about. 


I felt so guilty I told my boyfriend everything. He knows I have ocd and knows all about it. He told me that he felt no problem with it and wasn‚Äôt upset. 

But then the next thoughts came:

‚ÄúWhat if he only doesn‚Äôt have a problem because he knows you have ocd and doesn‚Äôt want to trigger you anymore so he plays it cool?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a terrible person who doesn‚Äôt deserve your boyfriend‚Äù

Whenever I see anything incest related on social media, even just the word, I can‚Äôt get it out of my head. It‚Äôs like my brain needs me to be aroused by it. I had to mute the word but the topic it keeps popping up. People I follow share stuff about it sometimes. 

I hate it. I start crying every time. Its so disgusting I dont want to think of having sex with my sister for fucks sake. I dont even have an irl sister. I dont get it . I wanna stop.

For the time being I'm okay but I know how anxiety inducing it is especially when you're masterbating or in a sexual mind space. All I can say really is that I hope you know your distress if anything proves you dont enjoy or want the scenarios to happen. But you're giving them power and room to keep coming back. You have to laugh at them and not take them seriously. They're testing you to see how far they can push you. When I have my phobia thoughts I start jumping number to number its annoying but it takes up my mental space as I cant think of another thought. Or sometimes it will escalate and I'll kind of test it back like okay now what? And laugh at how silly my mind gets carried away with shit. ### I hate this, it's like every time I try to make the thought go away it gets stronger, like I'm unknowingly putting all my attention on the thought which is what is giving it strength. I have no idea how I made it go away, I think it might be different for everyone, like one thing that may comfort one person may not comfort another. I know how you feel tho, it felt like at one point that the thought had become drilled into my brain everytime the word incest would come up, or just thinking about sex in general something I wouldnt like would always pop into my brain. It was like my brain was forcing me to accept it, like I was constantly being violated by something separate from myself, but it was all my fault somehow. If your constantly denouncing these thoughts and crying about them because there so traumatizing you can't hold it together, than you probably don't like them. Even if you had these thoughts while jerking off but you tried to keep going anyway or something, it doesn't mean your a bad person, maybe your using it as a coping mechanism, or maybe you just wanna finish, maybe you don't want the disease to control so you try to fulfill your goal but inevitably feel guilty about it. Try to look at yourself from an outside perspective, cuz from an outsiders perspective it would be pretty clear that whatever going on in your head is not something you enjoy and brings you great personal anguish. ### 1.Try looking at the thoughts as just a weird symptom of having your brain and not as an indication of something awful. 
2.Whatever you do tho do not think of these thoughts as a good thing no matter how tired becoming of shaming
3. do your best to try to think of them as bad but a nuetral sighting in your brain because you don't want these things anyway.  
4.for me there was one family member that would always pop into my head whenever I thought of the word sex. I think my mind fixated on it because it was the most disturbing person to think about, this might sound weird but it felt like they were hovering over me every time I had an explicit thought of any kind, like they were judging me, so every time I felt like they were watching I would replace the image I had of that person in my head by imaging an image of myself I took when I when 13, it's hard to explain, but after a while I didn't think about them when I thought of the word sex I just thought of my younger self, and I feel comfortable because it's me, thats very specific but I have no idea what your going through so I thought I'd say it ### ",7,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tgrd3r/crying_over_sexual_intrusive_thoughts_tw_for/

tgu333,"Something that helped me with existential OCD thoughts So, I posted something similar in a reply to someone else's post, but I was planning on posting it here anyway.
I read something once that I've been saying to myself whenever I have obsessions about my existence: that problem is not for me to solve.
Common existential OCD questions are things like ""what's the point of existence? Why am I alive? Is any of this real? Am I real? Is every action I take meaningless?"" and so on. And these are all questions that have been rattling in our brains since existentialism began. But here's the thing: there are lots of different answers to these questions, and none of them will cure us of OCD. So why should we allow OCD to scare us into ruminating? These are essentially impossible questions, and it's not my job to solve them. 
Do I still think about how nonsensical existance is? Yeah, it's pretty nuts. Humanity and life on Earth is pretty weird. But I'm not going to be the one to answer all of life's questions. It's not my job to solve that problem.
OCD hates uncertainty. It wants us to be absolutely certain of everything. So we need to sit with our uncertainties and our anxieties. We gotta get used to them, because they aren't going anywhere. We can handle uncertainty, and we can handle anxiety. We are stronger than we give ourselves credit for. We are stronger than OCD. Yes, even when we feel weak, and when we relapse.
I'm sending out my love to all of you, and remember that life's unanswered questions are not your responsibility! I hope this is helpful to some extent!",0,2022-03-18 01:26:16-04:00,,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tgu333/something_that_helped_me_with_existential_ocd/
tgvdjh,"awful new medication reaction.. i was diagnosed OCD, GA, + ADHD about 2 years ago. currently, i take Adderall (daily) and Propranolol (only when needed), and was recently prescribed Anafranil 50mg because the OCD has been getting more severe. 

i took my first dose of Anafranil around 10pm one night, with no other meds taken or still in my system. about 15-20 minutes later, i started feeling like i had heartburn. 
and it quickly grew to an ‚Äúoh my fucking god, my chest and lungs are on fucking fire‚Äù feeling. my throat started feeling like it was closing up, felt nauseous and like i was going to throw up, i had trouble breathing, and everything was just burning like absolute crazy.

tgsomi,How do you deal with intrusive sexual thoughts? I keep thinking that I'm looking at someone's privates. I will be talking to someone and all I can think is *stop looking.* My eyes will look all round the room and still won't skip over their privates. It feels like I have no control. I don't want to look and I don't like looking. Most of the time when this happens I will try to walk away from whoever I'm talking to.

Its debilitating i feel like no one understands. Even when I make an effort to try and not give in to a compulsive behavior, my thoughts go like ""Your negligence to do [compulsive behavior] is gonna result in you hurting someone/shows you are negligent of the safety of others"".

Any reply helps.",12,2022-03-17 14:12:48-04:00,"I deal with this, too. it‚Äôs really difficult when you feel like there‚Äôs nothing in your life you can do to ‚Äútake back‚Äù what you‚Äôve done. ### I definitely relate. I feel like I mentally examine my memories each moment of the day to determine whether or not I‚Äôm a bad person. ### I deal with this. My brain likes to bring up moments that I did the wrong thing. But something I‚Äôve been doing, with help from my therapist, is to see that my brain makes hundreds of choices all day long. My brain doesn‚Äôt focus on those, because OCD only wants you to focus on the bad. ### Yes! Absolutely, I relate to this. I think this is one of the hardest patterns I go through and it's dawning on me that I have compulsions relating to it. I've made mistakes when I was a teenager (had an edgelord phase, basically) and while I never tried to do physical acts of harm, it was some of my opinions and sense of humor that haunts me. I also had an abnormal, traumatic childhood so that didn't help much either. All of these components haunt me even when I don't need them to haunt me. Part of me is grateful to have more clarity in why I keep falling back to these habits, but it still sucks. It's still not deserved. ### Yupp! I've definitely had the thought of ""you know trying to get better by not doing the compulsion is putting people in danger, right?"" But that's how OCD gets you and continues to trap you. It's like it has a mind of its own with how adaptive it is! ### Heyy this reminds me of real event ocd. Seriously the only thing that got me over real event ocd is Jesus Christ. On YouTube there is a channel about dealing with ocd and also how we view God and explaining what God says that alot of people get wrong. The channel is called Mark DeJesus. Mark has gone through ocd as well and God healed him from it. He now helps other people who have ocd and need help. I was dealing with scrupolosity and a bit of real event ocd and his channel really helped me. He explains things in a calming and loving way. I highly suggest you check it out if you want to. I hope this helps you and God bless you and remember God loves you through it all. ### Holy crap I didn‚Äôt know that was OCD-related. So much of my life makes sense now ### All my life I struggled with this and it's only gotten worse as I've aged. Ruined friendships, relationships, and my career. No end in sight to it but I keep doing my therapy every day and hope that one day it'll turn around for the better. ### Same I can't even talk normally to people bc of this bc my OCD convinces me that I'm abusive ### I‚Äôm not officially diagnosed (I‚Äôve only suspected it), but yes, I‚Äôve dealt with thoughts like this. ### When I make a good decision or do a good thing im convinced that im somehow only doing it to manipulate others/trick them into thinking im ""good"". Do you experience this? ### All the time. My friends and family say I‚Äôm amazing and nice and so thoughtful, but my OCD tells me I‚Äôm just pretending and trying to gain something from the interaction. I just tell my OCD it could be worse. Im being kind to people, bottom line. If that‚Äôs because I‚Äôm manipulating ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è- I‚Äôm sure there are other harmful ways I could be doing it. ### ",26,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tggfwa/im_convinced_im_a_horrible_irredeemable_person/

tgywig,"""Forbidden"" thoughts while masturbating About 9 years ago when I was 21, I had a relationship with someone (let's call her B) and years later I realised the first time we had sex, I pressured her into it. This is not what I'm here to talk about, I have come to terms with it and moved on from it. I'm much more respectful now of boundaries.

As part of my ocd I am morally scrupulous and have made a ton of rules, some of them are actually good changes, eg not watching porn anymore because of reading about potential abuse of pornstars even in pro content.

I used to masturbate to thoughts of exes. Maybe I hadn't moved on from some of them, but that's a different story. One of the rules I made is that I stopped masturbating to thoughts of B, it felt wrong to me under the circumstances. The other day, I was doing it and the thought of sex with B came into my head but I hadn't realised right away that it was a forbidden thought. As soon as I realised, I redirected my attention to another thought. I'm attacking myself big time over it. ""I was getting off to that thought I know is forbidden"" ""how did I not see right what I was fantasising about"" ""Im such a POS""",1,2022-03-18 07:10:08-04:00,Why are you making all these rules?

tgrtpq,"Intrusive thoughts harm OCD type stuff with panic So for about a month I‚Äôve been having recurring panic attacks. Usually involved with intrusive thoughts / OCD. Usually these are violent intrusive thoughts and things I‚Äôd never do. So I did go to my GP and he prescribed Prozac which just made things 100000 times worse and gave me the worst and longest lasting panic attacks of my life. So bad that I went to see my favorite band (TOOL) in concert for the first time and had to leave. I was on 20 mg at the time. So my doctor backed it down to 10 and I was still feeling awful. Not eating, constantly anxious, terrible thoughts etc. so we stopped. Which is great because truthfully I know I‚Äôve been dealing with anxiety my whole life and it comes and goes in waves. A lot of times around the end of winter I start to get a little shitty and depressed. Anyways since I‚Äôve stopped the Prozac I‚Äôve still been having waves of panic / anxiety. Usually in the morning and the anxiety subsides and I feel great and then at night I usually have another flair up. I have been taking CBD isolate which has been minimally effective. I‚Äôm thinking about trying full spectrum because I know that it has worked for me. Sorry if I‚Äôm rambling but the time frame of Prozac 20 mg was 6 days followed by 2 days off followed by 2 days of 10 mg. I‚Äôve since stopped for 6 days with the approval of my GP and it seems things are getting somewhat better. Besides the recurring panic attacks and racing thoughts about shit I‚Äôd never actually want to do. I‚Äôve been practicing meditation and CBT while reading books about OCD, intrusive thoughts, and Harm OCD. This is somewhat helpful and I‚Äôm very confident it will be extremely helpful in the long run and will provide lasting relief. I did talk to my therapist, that I have a great relationship with, last week and then I meet with him again Monday (4 days). So I‚Äôm working on getting it under control and managing it.

Me and my darker side of my harm OCD intrusive thoughts (as I call her the ‚ÄúOther Me‚Äù or OM.‚Äù) she sometimes ‚Äúspeaks‚Äù to me through thoughts telling me to do horrible things like hurt people I care about. For example she‚Äôll say things like ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt it feel good to kill that person right now?‚Äù Or ‚ÄúCmon you know your crazy right? I‚Äôm a Demon from hell.‚Äù We even have these weird sort of conversations back and forth. It‚Äôs not like when you talk to yourself inside your head it‚Äôs almost like telepathy talking to another person but inside your head. I don‚Äôt hear her out loud though just in my head. I‚Äôve heard other thoughts inside my head too but usually it‚Äôs just her. ### Me ### Yeah do I've been going through the same thing as of late. It's driving me crazy... I don't weather I'm going insane or if I'm fine... my life is falling apart right... I don't know what to do. ### This seems to be moderately common. Some writings in psychology refer to it as an inner narrator. I can't be certain this is what your describing but it may be something for you to look into to get a better understanding. Something more akin to what your describing is typically referred to as the ego in some writings. The ego is the part of yourself that doesn't like change and prefers staying in whatever state of inertia you're in regardless of whether or not that state is healthy for you.

In my personal experience it tends to become more noticeable as you increase self awareness. Which makes sense as you're paying more attention to your thoughts.(I use terms of loudness to describe the emotional intensity as opposed to what would typically be considered volume). And for me personally as I worked through cognitive behavioral techniques and more esoteric meditation techniques with the purpose of increasing self love and self esteem that negative voice mostly quieted down and took on a more positive and supportive quality. Though as I'm still in what I'd call a transition phase there are negative intrusive thoughts still, but they are fewer and tend to be quiet. Enough so that if something negative does come up loudly it tends to catch me a little off guard. 

If it's helpful this is the basic technique I started with:

Starting the day, first thing by telling myself I love you while looking in a mirror and smiling. I keep a mirror by the bed specifically for this. It felt quite silly at first particularly with how badu self image was. It took almost a year before it stopped feeling silly and another before I started really believing it.
After it stopped feeling silly, I expanded to: I love all parts of myself.

Then as I started to like myself, when the intrusive thoughts popped up, if it seemed detrimental to the path and foundation I was building I address it: I love you, but this is not helpful for the direction I'm taking my life.

Hope someone finds this helpful. Take care and be well! ### I can relate, it‚Äôs like I have two parts of my mind as well, my normal mind then this other part that I have no I have no control over and it never shuts up. ### You aren‚Äôt going insane. It looks like a lot of people with OCD have this. ### Sometimes I fear that I‚Äôm going insane and sometimes that‚Äôs what the thoughts are but It‚Äôs just OCD. ### ",23,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tgfk6w/does_anyone_else_have_thoughts_that_are_voices_it/

tgwqk4,"does anyone have sensory hallucinations related to the theme of their ocd? 

i have had ocd for as long as i can remember , it'd be a continous cycle always coming back and then going away for a few months . each time i relapsed the obsession compulsive behavior would be different and so would the main theme. that was just to make a long a story short so i can mention a few examples in its proper context. but one consistent thing that I've noticed is having these hyper realistic sensory experiences related to my obsession at the time which feel almost too real...

an example of this would be when i was younger , like around the age of 5 or 6 , id have to go to preschool, and they'd make us do things like pick up the litter around the field (ya know , typical annoying school stuff) and i'd be absolutely horrified of throwing my litter away because i felt as if they had ""feelings"" & if i threw them away they'd come back to haunt me & give me bad luck , stuff like that.

 so id always keep them in my pockets or in my bag & obviously as a kid you get caught doing stuff like that & my teacher emptied my bag. i went home absolutely terrified but i was so scared to say anything ( some of my intrusive thoughts would sometimes blackmail me? if that makes any sense) so i begged and prayed that nothing bad happen.

 that night when i was in bed i heard things scratching on the floor , the wall , ripping the carpet, most notably things playing with my hair or slowly trying to touch my foot , the sensations felt realistic. I've noticed stuff like this throughout each cycle. right now im dealing with horrible contamination ocd

 sometimes if i walk past something that's perceived as contaminated and don't pay attention to the fact that i walked past it , i can feel it brush up against my leg , the sensation is so real..and whenever something like this happens i end up scrubbing the area with ethanol, strong soap , bleach, it all depends on the severity of what it could be. this is just the tip of the iceberg

tgtjkm,"OCD with food particles Hi. My name is Riyaan Sheikh. I come from a country called Burundi although my nationality is Indian (according to my passport). Also I'm currently in India seeking medical help which is going okay so far 

I have OCD and living with it is like hell. Ive had this issue mainly since 2015 although the FIRST EVER symptom was in 2013 but at that time i ignored it because i didnt know anything about OCD back then. What triggered me back then in 2013 was that my dad ate a biscuit but didnt wash his hands so i got triggered by it. 

Then as time went on things got worse and worse i.e the rituals that i engaged in got longer and longer. I was bearing this from 2015 (age 13) to around mid 2020 (age 18) and that's when things went really down i.e i had a mental breakdown. I remember one time (in 2020) i went to wash my hands but the hand washing rituals failed so many times that i got tired and angry at myself so i threw the soap. I literally spent hours just washing my hands. This was past midnight btw. 

Then after this i decided it was time to tell my family members that i had OCD. Now the thing is i didnt want to tell them directly so i just used to tell them that im not feeling good i.e having anxiety, but then later on i decided it was high time i tell them. I made the first step by calling my sister (who was abroad at that time) and telling her explicitly that i have OCD. After telling her that she then told my parents about it and thats how my parents got to know about it. 

A few months passed and it was time for me to go to school (year 13) but unfortunately i only studied for about 2 weeks before deciding to quit school. 

Now at that time whatever rituals i had to do used to take WAY longer than before i.e washing my hands, going to take a bath, keeping my spectacles on top of my second bed etc so i decided that i won't do any rituals any more and at that time i decided that i would stay the way i am i.e not taking a shower for months, sleeping on the couch instead of my bed, not wearing my spectacles and also eventually i told my parents not to let the houseworker clean the living room to the point that dust gathered everywhere in the living room area. Now my parents thought that i didnt have OCD because i let everything become dirty and so therefore they thought i was possessed by a jinn (supernatural entity in Islam) so they decided to do exorcism on me which went horribly bad since i knew i wasnt possessed by a jinn but my family members THOUGHT i was because i left the house dirty. 

The exorcism they did on my obviously didnt work and the exorcist was an ""extremist"" muslim so even he thought that i was possessed by a jinn. Due to this my condition became even worse. 

Days after he was done with his exorcism i finally got rid of him and for a few months i stayed in my house in the same dirty condition until two of my uncles came to me and told me that i had to get treatment ASAP. They gave me the option between going to India or getting local treatment from Burundi. Now at that time i didnt know how i would manage on the plane to go to India so i refused to go to India. So then they came back the next day and took me to a local metal hospital. 

When i reached there, unfortunately even they didnt understand fully what i had so they gave my this weird injection next to my ""rear end"" and because of that i couldnt even walk straight i.e my body involuntary kept on bending backwards and i couldnt stop that. I stayed there for two weeks before i was finally released (tbh i felt like a prisoner being released from jail). 

After being released me and my parents went to live at my aunt's house for a while and at that time for some reason i felt that things were ""clean"" again but it was only a matter of time before i started considering that house to be ""dirty"" as well. So around 6‚Äì7 months later i finally had the courage to come here in India and seek proper medical help. 

Alongside my OCD i also have social anxiety as well as a direct result of OCD. How do i overcome that? 

Now here's my case of OCD: 

In my case i am not afraid of germs but rather of minute food particles i.e leftovers. This includes things like but not limited to: 

1. bread crumbs 

2. ANY oily or greasy and sticky foods (THIS REALLY TRIGGERS ME!!!!!!!!!). 

In my case of OCD im not afraid of germs but rather of minute particles. Though there are some weird things which dont trigger me for example i dont get triggered when i bleed (from an injury or something). I can even touch the blood without the need to constantly wash my hands 

But when it comes to food items, the amount i get triggered is insane. I worry that when someone eats food i.e biscuits then doesn't wash his or her hands, that the biscuits crumbs will be transferred from the person's hand to objects and therefore the whole world becomes ""dirty"" for me. This effect is VERY STRONG ON OILY, GREASY AND STICKY FOOD ITEMS!!!!!!!!! 

As for my current situation im doing much better than before but the only thing left is this oil/greasy and sticky food items issue. If that can be solved then my OCD is pretty much gone. So how can i solve this issue? 

Conclusion:
I have two primary issues 

1. Social Anxiety 

2. Issues with minute food particles especially oily/greasy and sticky food items 

From these two issues, issue number 2 is the biggest issue.",3,2022-03-18 00:51:11-04:00,"I am terrified of any possible particles from meat, I relate so much to this, just commenting to see if anyone else has tips. ### If you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please do not hesitate to talk to someone.

tgk4t9,"False memory ocd?? please help Hello everyone, I need some advice. My wife recently started having false memories on Dec 10th. In her memories her parents, me and a ton of other people set her up to get repeatedly raped and abused over a span of 10 years. A bunch of people who she's never met and everyone she's ever met are in the memories. There is so many scenarios and details it's like a movie or a really messed up nightmare. She was sex trafficked and forced to kill people in the memories. In the memories I was helping the people to do it to her. We have been together since Jr high school. Right now she goes back and fourth knowing they're false memories and believing them She's super quiet and spaced out and spends alot of time playing them over and over. It's like pulling teeth to get her to talk to me. She was fine on Thanksgiving. All this came out of nowhere and I'm having a really hard time coming to grips with everything. It all happened overnight.  Has anyone experienced this. Does this sound like ocd? Will she always have these memories? my heart is broken that she could ever think I could do something like that to her. We've been together for over 15 years and things were amazing before all this. Is there any hope. I feel like she's gone and not coming back.",22,2022-03-17 16:58:30-04:00,"this doesn't seem like OCD, it seems like something else. i think you need to get your wife some help. ### A lot of my false memories are pretty elaborate. I'm genuinely petrified of not being in control. I was misdiagnosed with OCD years ago. What I actually have is OCPD. It's like OCD with a personality disorder thrown in. It's more extreme. I'm not sure how else to explain it. The detail in her false memory, the sense that everyone she knows is involved and the severity leads me to believe that she's in a similar situation. Or.. that she has repressed trauma and PTSD and now that she's 30 and her brain has been matured for a few years, her subconscious is trying to tell her something. I'm not a professional by any means but that's what happened to me. ### False memory OCD usually presents as cheating, murder or rape. Never heard of that many people being part of the obsessions.
Adult PANDAS? Maybe. You may want to get her a strep test. ### This is a really good review of false memory OCD. I think you‚Äôve done the right thing talking to the professionals because it‚Äôs def above my pay grade or ability to diagnose over Reddit but I think some of her symptoms do sound like OCD though I agree with others that it seemed to come on quickly. But I remember it happening to me fairly quickly when I was a young adult. How old is your wife?

https://www.sheppardpratt.org/news-views/story/did-we-already-discuss-false-memories-and-ocd/ ### The ocd specialist said it sounds like adult PANDAS/PANS that can cause rapid ocd onset. I've been requesting every test possible. She knows how ridiculous it all sounds but it feels real to her. It started as only a few details and the more she played it over in her head the more parts started coming in. It's been a nonstop 3 month nightmare. I don't know what to do anymore. ### It started as one incident 
cheating/rape and just escalated over 3 months. ### Yeah, for it to come on this quickly, something is going on. Get her some help ASAP. ### I have. She was diagnosed yesterday by a specialist with OCD. She's done blood tests/CT scans/ neurologist everything else so far is normal. She ruminates/seeks reassurance/mental checks. She has all the signs of ocd it just sounds a little different. I don't understand. It came up in December when she was under alot of stress. ### How is ocpd treated? Were you able to see they were false eventually. It's all she can think about. She's not at all the same as she was from 4 months ago. How were you able to get over it? ### She just turned 30 in January ### Did she have some type of infection that could have involved strep? If not, autoimmune might be something to look at, the specialists that she's seeing should be able to figure out if that is the case. Pregnancy could be a trigger, even if it quickly resulted in miscarriage (whether spontaneous or induced) could still trigger postpartum conditions due to the changes in hormones and the foreign cells from the fetus. If you are Rh-positive and she is Rh-negative, that could have caused other problems stemming from pregnancy. 30 is generally considered a bit old for onset of schizophrenia for whatever that's worth. ### She might have OCD but it looks like there is something else.USUALLY false memory OCD makes you remember things different or not being sure if you have or not done something when you most surely have, but you can't trust yourself.

I am not saying it is not possible because everybody's mind is different but as far as I know, false memories do not erase your past and reimagine a new one. ### i'm not a professional so i'm very confused. maybe she was falsely diagnosed because if she suddenly started acting like this there's no way this is OCD. ### I manage with therapy, my emotional support animal and medication as needed. Some of my most severe false memories never went away. I write stories and poems to gain a sense f control over them. A friend mine suggested the writing and it helps me think of them as stories, not memories. ### Wow, I‚Äôm sorry the two of you are in this situation. It sounds complicated. I hope the doctors can keep helping her. It takes time to recover no matter what the illness. ### I'm checking in to the possible infection. Pregnancy wouldn't be on the table because we're both female. Ive been ordering every test possible and she continues to get more details and different time frames the more she ruminates on it all. It's been 3 months of hell. Worst time of my life. It feels like she's never coming back. ### Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but isn‚Äôt false memory OCD when you can‚Äôt remember if you have or have not done something horrible, but in fact it‚Äôs very likely you in fact haven‚Äôt, and you‚Äôre just obsessing? ### It also seems like some cognitive decline. A week before she Haas her first memory she was acting off. Shee was lagging when I talked to her. Like it took. Awhile to process stuff I was saying. Shee completely stopped talking. And she still barely talks. It's a nightmare and I'm doing everything I can to figure out what's going on but it feels like she's never coming back. ### I imagine your focus has been all on her, but please don't forget to take care of yourself, she needs you to be strong and healthy. Autoimmune limbic encephalitis (ALE) is one thing I saw in looking at potential autoimmune causes, there should be some clues in MRI and EEG if that was the case, sounds like specific odd movements or seizure typically develop eventually as it progresses. Short term and long term memory deficits would be something to check, with memory deficits the brain can just make up stuff to fill in gaps in a way the person wouldn't realize that was happening. A random thing would be if she had attended any week or longer meditation retreats, it's rare, but I have heard stories of that stirring up hidden trauma and can be treated with trauma therapy. ### Yes, but in the case OP presents, she really thinks she had a different past ### She's still in there. Dont give up on her. Once she balances out she will be thankful that someone actually stood by her. Her mind is overwhelming her right now and I know it must be so hard to witness from the other side. You're doing right by her. Keep it up. ### It's really hard to take care of myself, better two jobs and taking care of her I'm lucky if I have a couple hours of sleep. We see the neurologist in a week and she has an MRI coming up. It just makes no sense. Things were really good before all this. I've watched her go from a happy full of life person to a shell of what she used to be. I don't even recognize her anymore. She was a completely different person just 5 months ago. It hurts so bad to think I'll never have that person back. ### ",7,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tgk4t9/false_memory_ocd_please_help/
tgnx3x,"regret and anxiety when I was about 13 years old, I had discovered porn and masturbating. I did it a lot, sometimes in the same room as a sleeping person.

One week a close family friend who‚Äôs 4 years younger than me came over, and when we were little we used to shower in our bathing suits together. We were basically like sisters and sometimes showered with nothing on. We would joke around in the shower and neither of us would even notice the other person being naked, we would just shower fast, laugh and sometimes fall in the shower. 

After I discovered masturbating, I quickly started doing it in the shower often. When my friend came over I didn‚Äôt have any time to be by myself so I decided to try *it* behind a few towels after she got out of the shower. She had no idea what I was doing and I told her it was nothing and tried to do it. I ended up not being able to actually do anything because I was with another person, obviously, but the fact that I got behind towels and attempted to in ‚Äúprivacy‚Äù while she was in the room, a younger girl, disturbs me so damn much.

I know for a fact I didn‚Äôt do it with her in my mind, it had nothing to do with her.  I had no intention of her seeing me/finding out, I just wanted to do something I always did in the shower and I was upset that she was there because I couldn‚Äôt find time alone.  I was trying to get her out of the bathroom so I could do it but since she wouldn‚Äôt leave I just told her I was gonna let myself dry inside the shower with the towels and she did the same outside the shower. I know she didn‚Äôt see anything, and I mean anything.

I made sure she wouldn‚Äôt see any movement, hear anything or see any expression on my face and it only lasted like a minute or so before I decided not to.

Does that make me gay???,16,2022-03-17 19:45:56-04:00,"This is OCD. It creates doubt in our minds. It creates panic in you and it makes you ""need to know"" the answer. That's why youre here looking for reassuarnce or an answer. 

No one can you tell your sexual preference other than you. You seem to know this is HOCD but it seems like youre in doubt. Are you seeing an OCD therapist? ### Maybe bisexual ### Thanks.

No I'm not seeing a therapist I sort of self diagnosed. Last year I remember obsessively checking to see if I was actually attracted to girls by looking at their pictures because i felt attraction. I've relapsed a few times and now I have it with Tocd too. 

The person above said I could be bisexual, do you think that too? ### I've never wanted to be with women though ### You're seeking reassurance to obtain certainty that, even if it existed (it doesn't), your OCD would never be satisfied with anyway. It would be more useful to look for therapy resources so that you can get appropriate and effective treatment for SO-OCD. ### you could be bisexual but also internalised homophobia could cause people to deny their sexuality in their mind. at the same time, girls are just hot. this attraction you feel could be envy or just admiration. ### Thanks. Butt I'm just so worried I'm not straight.

Someone said that it could mean I'm bisexual. Do you also think that? ### What type of attraction would it be if I was? and I've never actually wanted to be with any girl, just boys. The attraction is only during an intimate scene, a sexual fantasy perhaps. I wouldn't do that in real life.

Apparently many straight girls like to watch lesbian porn, do they also wish to do what I said in my og post? (the intimate scene I mentioned was of hetro btw.) ### I'm not going to provide you with any anonymous reassurance. Therapy is what you need, not reddit. ### im fairly sure im straight and i like watching lesbian porn and imagining myself in their position, i think much like other fantasies you wouldn‚Äôt actually want to carry out in reality (r@pe fantasies, taboo ect) its the idea of doing something you wouldn‚Äôt/shouldnt do that gives you that feeling. so if you think you arent lgbt this could be it. ### yeah I found out about that just last week and all that time I thought I was a creep for having those fantasies, but never knew lesbian could be part of it.

does it still count as that if it's a video of a man and woman, and I wish I was in the mans place instead? ### yes. fantasy and reality is separate, if a girl has a nice body i usually find myself imagining myself with her even if in a real situation i wouldn‚Äôt. ### [read this](https://www.glamour.com/story/same-sex-fantasies-when-you-identify-as-straight/amp) ### also please remember that if you are sexually attracted to girls, that is not a bad thing and if this is the case, opening up to the idea may be the best thing you can do. ### I've never questioned that at the time, until my ocd latched onto it as evidence.

First, I haven't been able to find any therapists in my area accepting new patients so this is my first introduction to any sort of professional help other then trying Talkspace which didn't seem to help at all. Secondly, my insurance is accepted so I don't have the $200 hit a session so I don't have as much financially riding on it. Overall my experience has been positive. I feel like my therapist knows exactly how to tackle OCD and understands that it's not anxiety, it's not depression, it's OCD that I truly need help with.

I just made a post too with the same question lol. I ended up making the first appointment and I'm doing it tomorrow but that price is making me feel so guilty and anxious ### Hey! I did NOCD therapy for quite a while, and it helped me. Message me for details! ### what sorts of things are you learning? would it be just as beneficial to watch therapists on youtube and working on it solo? or does having advice tailored to you help you resist compulsions? ### same. also worried about paying that much for them to just tell me/ help me through the obvious of not doing compulsions but obviously that is easier said than done. idk man i hate this disorder so much ### Yep.

These thoughts are exhausting because I know I would never act on them and find them revolting. ### Agreed, it really sucks because with a sexual theme, if you have a sexual thought, your body often has some kind of natural response because of blood flow, and your OCD takes that as an acknowledgment that you must want that thought or like/agree with it as a result.

tglt6e,"The inner word becoming more real than the outer One of my themes is existential OCD and fear of losing my memory. I have found that when I'm either super depressed or in a heavily obsessive period it will feel like my physical senses are going blind, like everything I'm experiencing in the ""real"" world has become just a thing that happens, something I will forget very quickly, and something overshadowed by the vast expanse of my own thoughts. It will be as if I'm seeing something and not seeing it at the same time. The thoughts themselves will become like a network of strings that I can navigate. An image I will often spend time in is a black empty space with a white house drawn in white chalk. This image will take on such reality that it becomes a comforting space to retreat to. It's not like it takes on physical dimension, it just overtakes reality in ""realness"". Physicality no-longer means much.

The previous one I suffered with was do you want to kill people and now this one is I'll put a warning here just in case but it was being attracted to little girls which creeped me tf out and has since like last week. What caused was I was watching a anime and one of the characters who was idk like 10 looked similar to someone older like 15 or 16 andy head started getting flooded which has made my life a nightmare where it even goes to irl now where I looked at a little girls ass riding home from school cause my thoughts were overwhelming me but after like 3 seconds I got my senses back together and was fine again and was fine with my friends as a whole but one thing that worried me tf out was when I was masturbating I was getting thoughts of that shit and like I didn't stop which worries me tf out like it came out of no where and for a sec it felt like I enjoyed it and then I came back to my senses. I've genuine never felt like this and the only one I told was my mum and this shit is worrying me out tf and I haven't gotten a boner or anything but like 20 mins ago after I had them thoughts again I had the feeling to wank but idk if it had to do with that or not and I'm sorry if I wierded anyone out but ye I'm really worried bout myself and could it be OCD?,2,2022-03-17 21:38:17-04:00,Damn bro hope you will feel better ### Bro it's making me feel sick ### ,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tgq0xj/sexual_intrusive_thoughts_sensitive/

You may not have control of the intrusive thoughts but you have control of what you focus on or what you think about. 

It is hard and fighting OCD is a battle. OCD is a shape shifter. Once OCD gets used to one theme, it gets tired and moves on to something new. You have to expect it to happen.

It‚Äôs like they feed off each other and it‚Äôs been so bad since I stopped smoking.

I don‚Äôt remember which one.

But is there anyone who‚Äôs on medication for either or both? Does one help ease the symptoms of the other? Does being on both help?",1,2022-03-17 20:57:26-04:00,"Hey I‚Äôm so sorry for how much they‚Äôve been playing off of each other and making you suffer, as someone with both I totally feel you. In terms of medicine, I‚Äôm currently on both Fluvoxamine and Adderall, and they actually work super well together. I had been on adderall for most of my life for ADHD but then stopped. Recently, after starting my Luvox, my psychiatrist actually recommended the adderall as he there had been some recent data that showed adhd meds improving effectiveness of SSRIs which is kinda neat. 

I notice that my ADHD tends to make me more susceptible to rumination and obsession since I‚Äôm more distracted from the task at hand and therefore it sends the OCD into a downwards spiral. It also creates more anxiety because I‚Äôll forget about what I‚Äôm ruminating about and therefore my OCD freaks out because it‚Äôs not getting the supposed reassurance that it thinks I‚Äôll get from ruminating, so then it tries harder to ruminate and check to remember the obsession. When I started taking the adderall, I noticed that I would actually ruminate less, and it felt like I would be more focused on the task at hand and have less intrusive thoughts/obsessions. Not perfect but it helped a bit! Also it helps with my ADHD of course and it‚Äôs worked miracles for my focus and executive function, so that‚Äôs absolutely the best benefit lol

Sometimes I just keep a hair tie on my finger and play with that and it distracts me from picking. ### I usually just use lotion on everywhere I am tempted to pick at. It makes it harder to do and the added moisture helps repair any damaged skin. I also find the simple action of doing something with my skin helps distract ### I find that for me, having a skin care routine that helps keep my skin clear helps as well as fidgets like a pop socket on my phone to play with or something to hold, like when im at my desk I keep a weighted stuffed animal on my shoulder that I put my hands on instead ### I‚Äôm a skin picker too - pick the skin around my fingers until it bleeds.

Do you:

1. Notice then immediately disregard the thought and carry on with the elevated anxiety
2. Observe the thought, ""say maybe she doesn't like me,"" to increase & accept the anxiety then carry on.
3. Exaggerate the thought, ""maybe she really hates me and its only a matter of time till we separate,"" to flair the anxiety and then try to sit with it.

I'm trying to find a balance of how to talk about my good days and bad days because I don't want to overwhelm her. She's been my rock throughout all of this and super supportive but I want to be able to let her know about how I'm doing without bringing her down. I know I have no reason to feel guilty but can't help it. Any advice for how to balance talking about OCD without constantly bringing it up? Does it make sense what I am asking about?",2,2022-03-17 14:46:25-04:00,"Well, it does make sense, but I would venture to say ‚Äî you do sound a *bit* like you‚Äôre obsessing about this topic as well (how do I bring this up with my SO without upsetting her‚Ä¶ how much is too much?‚Ä¶ what if I make her sad?). All that said, it‚Äôs very thoughtful for you to be thinking so much about her well-being while you‚Äôre struggling. :)

I historically have had ‚Äúreassurance seeking‚Äù and ‚Äúconfessing‚Äù as compulsions, so I‚Äôve definitely overburdened my loved ones with OCD talk. When I did eventually decide to just stop bringing it up with them all together, I found my OCD improved (because I was cutting off a compulsion as well as ruminating less about my disorder). If you‚Äôre not talking about it, they probably aren‚Äôt even thinking about it. 

If you were to make a rule, like ‚ÄúI only talk about OCD with her once a day,‚Äù you might find that can become a compulsion given its rigidity. 

I might be tempted instead to say something like, ‚Äúhey, my OCD has really improved and I‚Äôd rather not think about it as much. As such, I won‚Äôt bring it up with you, but if you ever want to check in or ask anything you can!‚Äù That way if she is curious or wants to know your progress, you can be honest with her, but you‚Äôre not initiating the conversation.

Best of luck!! ### Thank you! All great points. The last paragraph actually never really occurred to me so that's extremely helpful for giving the OCD even less of the attention that it craves. ### ",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tgh8da/tips_for_not_overwhelming_your_significant_other/

üîπPerfectionism ‚Äî Every task, even individual parts, having to be evenly timed (via clock/timer), counted, some things also seen, heard, smelt, tasted &or felt, ""perfectly"", if it doesn't ""feel right"" I have to keep redoing it until it does...

üîπReassurance ‚Äî Reresearching my current struggles to reassure what I already know & having to go back to read/look at things on walks

üîπ Mental Hoarding ‚Äî Having to keep track of the clock time, timer time, phone/battery percentages etc during every activity & when reading/watching stuff having to rewind/keep track of any words idk, words I don't hear often, absurd words like ""uh/um"", repeated images, patterns etc, it makes reading & watching stuff (which I use to enjoy) feel like a stressful chore now... 

It literally effects everything I do; cooking, eating, walking, yoga, cleaning, showering, reading, watching video/films, chatting, texting etc... I feel like I'm losing my mind & there's no fucking escape because even things that are supposed to bring joy & relaxation stresses me out because of my OCD anxieties... I'm not a pessimist I think that there is a lot to enjoy in life but what's the fucking point if I can't even enjoy any of it due to ocd?? So rationally speaking suicide makes sense right?

The key here is to be mindful and it seems like you are mindful because youve noticed the things you do. But you have to learn to let go and NOT JUDGE yourself. 

With perfectionism and feel right, you simply have to allow yourself to slip up. Start small. Like if I were you I would do an activity and not time it. 1 activity. Youre anxiety is gonna go up. Let it go up, and watch it come down. When you start getting more confident, do more exposures. This is exposure and responseprevention. You expose yourself to your fear and you dont do the compulsions.

Your compulsions are a lot of avoidances. Also, do you do any mental compulsions? 

Im not a professional, but this can be addressed and fixed. Talk to an OCD therapist that does ERP. You have to cut out the compulsions and avoidances. Then the OCD gets weaker.

They weren‚Äôt going to allow my mom to come in with me because of Covid restrictions, but I informed the staff I had severe OCD as well as PTSD related to medical trauma, which added a whole other level of panic to the experience, so they made an exception. The entire time I was shaking, crying, and hyperventilating. But I fucking did it. I can‚Äôt believe I did it. I felt nauseated and like I was going to faint. 

The past few days of waiting for results have been absolute hell on earth.

tge6ji,"Is this my OCD? What should I do? I have contamination OCD and its more about disgust and guilt than germs. I'd emailed an OCD specialist online and they gave me some advice and I was fine, but I repeatedly felt the need to ask every little doubt, and seek advice frequently( like how I do on this subreddit, almost every single one of my posts is edited for the same reason, including this. I'm scared my doubts are genuine and I'll end up ignoring the real important ones), which I think turned into a compulsion. A few days later, when I clearly mentioned that I just feel disgusted, they said it affects a different part of the brain and takes time. If it doesn't improve after consistent ERP for weeks or months, they move on to response prevention, where the main focus is not responding or avoiding. I've been trying out ERP since December, and I see very slow and little improvement, but its there. They told me I should continue, but now I feel like ERP isn't even required for disgust because its actually somehow justified, and that's why they move on to only response prevention. I also feel like all the advice they'd given me, was for contamination issues with germs, and I feel the need to ask and hear advice for disgust separately, to be sure. I know it sounds silly, but for some reason its bothering me. Its almost like taking advice from a therapist is like reassurance to me, so I know I'm doing it right. I'm thus also scared to go to a therapist, because them asking me to do the exposures, or just giving any kind of advice, implies its the right thing to do.

Do you think this is my OCD? Should I ask for advice separately on disgust or would that mean giving into my compulsion? What can I do about this whole situation in general? Any advice would be appreciated.

Some of the reassurance seeking thoughts I get are (these are very few, there's loads of them):

I also feel like asking for advice here is slowly turning into a compulsion, I'm not sure though. Not knowing whether its OCD scares me because what if end up ignoring the rational thoughts? What if I never learn to differentiate, or become ignorant by ignoring rational thoughts and actions while I'm still learning, never learn, or due to normal exposures r the ones that are really taken too far. What if I get used to them and continue doing them for the rest of my life out of mere convenience, and become disgusting, unhygienic, disrespectful? People will hate me for it, because even people without OCD find it disgusting and think about it to some extent, and it may have some harmful effects in the long run, health wise or just hygiene and cleanliness wise.

What can I do about these thoughts?

Thank you.",9,2022-03-17 12:30:50-04:00,"My fellow OCD bud, what you are asking is known as rumination. You are currently trying to figure out the impossible. My best answer is ‚Äúdon‚Äôt‚Äù live with the unknown. Ocd loves black and white, but hates the grey areas. If you can find peace with the uncertainty you will realize it‚Äôs all in da head. Hang in there! ### Hi friend!

First of all, I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre dealing with this. It‚Äôs so difficult. :(

A few thoughts ‚Äî I would say that, yes, almost certainly ‚Äúasking for advice‚Äù here is really ‚Äúreassurance seeking.‚Äù You have a therapist, you seem to know a lot about the disorder, and you say you‚Äôve asked lots of questions before‚Ä¶ feels like it‚Äôs more compulsive than just ‚Äúhaving a question I can‚Äôt answer.‚Äù One compulsion isn‚Äôt the worst thing, but it‚Äôs not helping your recovery.

I would look at how you‚Äôre practicing your ERP (what is your goal when you do an exposure? Are you really not doing any compulsions to alleviate anxiety? Are you doing exposures that consistently affect you?). If you‚Äôre not feeling some relief by now, then it might be worth tweaking how you‚Äôre practicing it. If you love your therapist, then sure, keep going with them ‚Äî if you want to try a new one, that‚Äôs an option too‚Ä¶ therapy isn‚Äôt one-size-fits-all, sometimes it‚Äôs takes time to find someone you work well with.

If you‚Äôd like the reassurance of your question asked in spite of that, I‚Äôm giving it. Again, one compulsion doesn‚Äôt destroy all your progress but it certainly doesn‚Äôt help. For that reason I‚Äôll put it as a spoiler and you can decide. ^_^ 

>!When we talk about ‚Äúanxiety‚Äù or ‚Äúintrusive thoughts‚Äù people naturally assume it‚Äôs always ‚Äúfear.‚Äù But both can appear as other emotions: anger, sadness, frustration, etc. It‚Äôs just how our bodies are responding to a perceived threat. I would argue ‚Äúdisgust‚Äù is almost a form of fear ‚Äî something grosses you out because your body is fearful it will hurt you and wants to keep you away from it. I don‚Äôt know why your therapist wants to move on to only ‚Äúresponse prevention,‚Äù but I think there might be some simplified communication going on. They may see that you‚Äôre struggling to do exposures in the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù way and may be trying to come in from another angle. If you are able to stop doing compulsions, naturally your OCD will get better. Exposures is just one way to reduce the number of compulsions.!<

Hope that helps and best of luck with your recovery! ### My issues are almost identical to yours, but I'm a guy. To be honest I was beginning to think only guys had this kind of contamination OCD.

I have tried doing the deed in different spots of the house and have even dabbed some of my \[redacted\] onto different objects (objects I cherished no less), and - it kind of worked, for a while, but eventually I succumbed to cleaning things again.

I think you have it easier than me. You seem to be concerned about being ""inconsiderate"". In that case, why not just adopt a ""screw what people think"" attitude? I don't think anyone would be scandalized about the things that are concerning you.

I mean, I don't know. I'm a religious guy. I feel much cleaner when I simply refrain from indulging in that sin. Maybe give abstinence a try.

As for your current concern, I think you need to chill down and be more objective. Don't try to write perfectly detailed posts and don't expect perfect replies. Just try to present a general outline of the problem in a concise fashion. I have the same issue there too, my posts are full of  hyper-specific details. ### You are most definitely seeking reassurance, which is a compulsion.

I will note this: Obsessions are intrusive thoughts  images, feelings, urges, impulses or sensations that cause distress. Most sufferers define their distress as anxiety, but it can also be disgust, shame, guilt and a few others.

That's all you need to know. Next time you doubt, ignore it and push on. ### Thank you for the reply and help! I know I should stop the rumination and live with it, but at this point its hard for me to differentiate even between the rational thoughts and my ocd. I've been trying to not figure that our either, but its so hard, and leads to more doubts and fears. ### Thank you so much for the help! I am almost sure that these questions are supposed to not be dealt with as a part of erp and my goal when I'm doing exposures is to get that feeling of disgust out of my head. It seems to be stuck and although I don't avoid anything, I just feel like I'm living in filth and I hate it. It seems to be the only thing I think about all day and I don't know how to focus on anything with it. ### If you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please do not hesitate to talk to someone.

I've tried abstinence, but it only ended up being an escape from dealing with the ocd, and unfortunately got worse.

I definitely have to push myself to not write details, I just fear missing out on something ""important"".

Also, I feel like I could adopt a ""screw what people think"" kind of attitude for anything but this as its about hygiene and being a ""dirty and disgusting person"". Or maybe its my ocd again, its so hard to tell at this point, honestly.

Thank you for the help! ### Thank you so much for the help! I have been trying to ignore anything I doubt and that causes anxiety, but what's made it worse is the fact that I find it hard to tell between ocd and a rational, real doubt.

tgl4lj,"[NSFW] Sitting with temptation to do something self destructive I'm a masochistic, have explored BDSM for a long time in extremely unhealthy ways. I love pain, want to be hurt, and there are ""shady"" ways of doing that which I can't shake off of me. I often will sit for hours contemplating whether or not if I should do it, play games like flipping a coin or something rng related on whether or not I do it, and at the same time I get ""tremors"" or my entire body shakes. I assume the shaking is from anxiety and excitement but maybe it's something more?

It only happens on certain days, idk what exactly triggers it. I'll wake up and really want to get into a ""sub space"". This has caused me to do things that not only am I not proud of but has put me in incredibly serious danger. I sort of justify it since it's not immoral or at least I'm not hurting anyone except myself.

I've tried jerking off to get it out of me, I've tried pushing past it and moving on, I've tried showering or something something stimulation wise to get my mind off it. No matter what I do it just engulfs my entire mind. I feel like I'm barely in control.

tgkucs,"OCD Relapse After a year and a half of what I would say was 70% recovery (only dealing with minor OCD thoughts and anxieties and stronger ones only hitting once a month or so), I've had hell the past two weeks. Anxiety about one thing after another that won't go away, even after I reason through it in my mind. This week it's been paralyzing. I was down to taking one Klonopin pill once or twice a month, but these past two weeks I've taken it every day at least once, sometimes more. It's been really discouraging and exhausting. I'm starting therapy again next week and am just hoping I can tolerate the anxiety until then. Could use prayers for strength, wisdom, and emotional stamina.

tgfo97,"Several flare up of OCD symptoms, please help!! I'll do this numerically so it's easier to follow as I can ramble.

1. I was recently diagnosed as having OCD, this is comorbid with an existing CPTSD diagnosis.

2. Although just diagnosed, through exploration with my therapist it's been established that I have probably been suffering with it since I was an adolescent. I've had times of similar thoughts and extreme behavioral patterns that have lasted as long as 19 months and as short as a few weeks. 

3. I've had periods of extreme ruminating on everything from world events (Ukraine), relationship and family status, personal health, career etc. I also have been having fears of contamination with various things. 

4. In the last 2 months I have had 3 friends pass away, I was assaulted in a random attempted robbery which I was able to fight the Individuals off but suffered injury. I changed jobs and became fixated on the Ukraine war started I became obsessed with it.

5. The day Mr Putin put his forces on Nuclear forces on high alert...I went on high alert and that appeared to be the tipping point, I snapped. I began to check my phone 300-400 times a day looking for updates on the war, I started to believe I was ill and would.examine my body for signs. I began to check things like if my doors were locked hundreds of times a day as well.

6. I feel absolutely helpless and hopeless right now, I'm a husband and father and feel I'm letting my family down. I spend.my days checking the news or in some form of ritual. Attempts to stop make it more of a temptation and I will refresh the same websites over and over and can't stop.

My question for everyone is just some advice on treatment or medication successes? I'm on 20 mg of Cipralex daily and also take Ativan when the symptoms get too extreme but I'd like a more long term solution.

Thank you",1,2022-03-17 13:38:02-04:00,"I'm sorry about the unfortunate events you've been dealt.  It seems stress can intensify OCD symptoms.  As for checking, my therapist tells me to set limits for myself.  For example, only checking at the top of each hour, or prolonging the amount of time until I check.  So I can say to myself ""I will not check until tomorrow.""  When tomorrow comes, I can check or I can repeat to myself ""I will not check until tomorrow.""  My therapist also likens checking to taking the first sip (if one is an alcoholic); checking once will only reinforce obsessive thought so it is best to not check at all.  It's not easy, and it takes a great deal of effort, but setting limits on checking is very important.  It helps me but I have to commit to it.  Failing is part of the process but I keep trying.

My father recently passed and I want to have my family over to celebrate my mom and sister's birthday, but she will not allow it because she doesn't want to hassle with people, germs, dirt, mess, etc.  This is just one of many examples and may be the tipping point for me.

Ever since i read [THIS](https://drmichaeljgreenberg.com/understanding-pure-o-you-are-not-having-intrusive-thoughts-all-day-you-are-ruminating/) article and i get intrusive thoughts i keep blaming myself for having them because the article says that Rumiation is a compulsion & that we are purposely doing it, is it really my fault? Like im so scared of guilt.",7,2022-03-17 09:34:58-04:00,"That‚Äôs BS. No one‚Äôs mental illness is their fault. ### Okay it is not your fault or anyones fault to have the intrusive thoughts. I just read the article too but I don‚Äôt think it is our fault at all. It‚Äôs not for me anyway like planning out how your gonna do something it is more just there. I don‚Äôt get to pick when I‚Äôm just chilling in the car and boom an instructive thought is like ‚Äúwhat happens if you get in a car crash‚Äù ‚Äú what happens if this happens‚Äù. I myself don‚Äôt look for the emotion I would feel, I don‚Äôt try to play it over and Over it just happens. I don‚Äôt think someone without OCD understands that if we could just not have those thoughts we wouldn‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt think he understands even when I try and fight with my thoughts saying that‚Äôs not real it won‚Äôt happen the thought will still continue to play in my head. ### That's the reason why the only stuff I read on the internet related to OCD is this sub.

Anything I want to know I write it down and I ask to a doctor.

  
I wonder where the FFFFF those who write these articles get the information from, because they are always BS ### Exactly thank you!! ### The weird thing is when I googled it I found other sub reddits saying he‚Äôs right and makes them feel happy that it can be cured? One person went to this so called doctor and they said all they did was repeat what was done online. They found it pointless? ### It is not the same a single ocd like episode caused by a situation (covid for example made non ocd people have these episodes) that a chronic ocd. The first can be cured, the second one‚Ä¶ nope. That does not mean that we cannot learn to live with it instead of fighting it every time. Compulsions are the response to something that your brain considers to be a danger. That is supposed to be a bad method because reinforces the intrusive thoughts but it is still the natural response until you learn how to manage them. 
It is not your fault. Don‚Äôt make you responsible for something you can‚Äôt control, same as you can‚Äôt control the weather. ### Ohh okay that makes more sense. Thank you! ### ",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tgadwe/having_intrusive_thoughts_is_my_fault/

Complete nonsense but it makes sense to me XD. Another is when I see certain things I have to like ""erase"" it by blurring my eyes at it and then looking at a light source and blinking rapidly at said light source. Idk man.",34,2022-03-17 01:21:12-04:00,"I feel a lot like OCD people in movies and tv shows. I have like a 30 minute checking routine before I can even leave the house. My latest obsession has been a fear of a house fire so I go through and check any possible fire hazard. I have to touch any candle wicks, the stove burners, put my hand inside the stove and microwave to make sure it‚Äôs not hot, and touch my wax burner. I also say it out loud like ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not hot, that one‚Äôs good, this one‚Äôs fine.‚Äù And I also say the word ‚Äúoutlet‚Äù every time I look at one and see it‚Äôs okay. I check the locks on my doors anywhere from 5-30 times depending on the day. I‚Äôm also not traditionally superstitious or religious but I‚Äôm terrified if I think like anything like negative about the world or universe it will retaliate so I always ask ‚Äúit‚Äù not too or say like ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt really mean that‚Äù. 

Fun times üòÇ ### I blink 3-5 times whenever it feels like I have to. I don‚Äôt even know why. You guys understand I‚Äôm sure ### speaking so slowly to avoid saying anything like ""like,"" or ""um."" but also avoiding contractions , it is ridiculous how much we use them in speech and writing ### Harm OCD telling me random reasons for why I should hurt people while trying to convince me I‚Äôm somehow crazy and unhinged when I know I‚Äôm not that bad and don‚Äôt want to hurt anyone at all. I was one of the nicest people in my friend group and it makes me feel like some sort of aggressive person. ### Since I was a young kid, I have phrases I repeat in my head on a near-constant basis, from random words/ruminations to music. It took me the longest time to realize how abnormal that was -- to have your mind in constant autopilot without means of stopping. It used to be nonsense phrases like you've said here, repeating a word three times/other things, but now that I'm older it's spiraled into constant suicidal ideation. Part of my obsessions is suicide and/or death, so now the phrases in my head repeat the words 'kill myself' in some way. That isn't to say that I'm actively suicidal because I never am, this is just part of my cognition and has been for a long time, unfortunately. I could be functioning fine and still deal with these thought patterns.

I completely understand. Having your mind always on is more exhausting than what most people think. You're not alone! ### I have to open and close specific drawers in multiples of 4.. I don‚Äôt even know the reason why, except that I‚Äôll lose my shit if I don‚Äôt üòÇ ### Jumping on one foot a certain number of times while doing a complicated arm ritual, which has to correspond with the time that I‚Äôm in the air during the jumps. Often accompanied by having to envision the word ‚Äúno‚Äù in a certain colour in my mind. Man, just writing that out is so ridiculous üòÇ ### I have a serious checking ocd. I check my windows before bed every night multiple times and sometimes stand and just stare to remind myself they are shut!

Little did I know, my neighbour over the fence thought I was watching them!! 

I was humiliated and it stopped me for a bit but I keep having the urge to check they are closed! I just can‚Äôt stop thinking they are open or unlocked ### For a while I had a really bad tick of going ""Fuck off!"" or ""I hate myself I hate myself"" whenever an intrusive thought popped up. Very embarrassing when in public. ### I have to pee 4 times before going to sleep/going out otherwise someone I love will die ### I remember i had to slap my right shoulder very quickly ten times. This was particularly annoying because at the time i didn't know i had ocd so whenever anyone asked why i was doing that i didn't want to say ""oh yeah voices in my head say if i dont ill go to hell"" and sound insane so i just went ""uh stretches lol"" ### I have a hard time thinking of any of them as nonsensical because they all make sense to me, heh. But, maybe picking random little bits out of my food to leave aside, usually pieces no bigger than like a grain of rice, because that piece specifically is bad (arbitrary, usually they‚Äôre identical to all other pieces, I don‚Äôt know what makes them bad).

Or the specific way and order in which I have to do Dirty things to get them done and then become clean without getting other things Dirty.

And, not a compulsion, but an accessibility feature. I deal with a lot of my problems by getting my friends with OCD to straight up lie to me about stuff (if they‚Äôre okay with doing it) because I trust them and if they said that they checked and [thing] is okay then that means it‚Äôs okay because they have OCD and they‚Äôd know. ### I work in a school cafeteria and I have to check many times (and ask my coworkers to do it too) if for example chicken is not raw anymore because I‚Äôm afraid that I will harm people with the food I make. Sucks. ### If i have a thought i dont like i have to make myself shiver to make it feel better ü§£ ### When I was living at my moms, and when I sleep there some nights now, I have to relock the front door multiple times in a row before bed and watch myself do it. When I go upstairs to bed, I will go back downstairs to lock it again.. and then I will go do the same to the back door. When I wake up in the middle of the night to pee, I will go downstairs again to check the doors are locked. Even if I know I locked it, it‚Äôs still not good enough, and I need to physically do it again and keep my eyes on my hands as I turn the lock to focus on the fact that it is indeed locked. ### Having to tap furniture/step my feet in rapid succession otherwise something ‚Äúbad‚Äù will happen ### Checking and rechecking (and rechecking!) my door locks when I leave the house. ### Telling myself I'm not going to drink the bleach just because I looked at it. ### I whisper ""Sealed is good""  A few times when checking anything multiple times when closing or locking up.  I Been saying it as long as I can remeber I dont know where it came from. ### Writing the same phrase over and over again. Saying the same thing over and over again to myself like ‚ÄúI am light I am releasing heavy energy, I am losing weight‚Äù . The need to stretch over and over and over and over again with no real end in sight ### Eating a few bites of food and waiting 10 ish minutes to finish or completely saving it for later or giving it to someone else (fear of allergic reaction). ### every fucking one.... ###  you just described me perfectly. the checking things is crazy. i also, stick my hand in the oven and touch the burners to make sure they're not hot, unplug my coffee pot and toaster and still have to touch them to make sure they're not hot. then i have to run my hand under the sinks to make sure the water is off. then after i check them all. i have to check them again and again. it's so exhausting. ### I have the irresistible urge to fidget with each of my fingers at random times, so yes ### Oh lord I have a blinking one too.

I know it feels like you wasted your youth but honestly you're still young, there are many people who don't get help for ocd until their 40s or even later. Try to consider on the positive that you're taking steps to get help and regain your life. ### i'm 32 and it ruined my 20s also.. sorry. just make sure you're getting therapy and/or medication to try to reclaim the time. but you're also barely in your 20s. plenty of time left ### I went through the worst type of OCD when I was 22. I am now a 34 year old and things are so, so much calmer in my mind.üíö I really love my life now and wouldn't change it for the world. It gets better. ### Hi, first I need to tell you that I'm deeply sorry and that I understand what you are going through.

From my point of view, you really should try again meds, but maybe zoloft or a more adapted one. 

I was at some point just like you when I was at my lowest and it feels horrible I know mate :(

I also know that you are a wonderful human being, an empathic one and that's rare nowadays.

You won't hurt anyone. You are worrying because you are a great person.

take care :) ### I am also 22 years old, I've had OCD since I was 8 so I understand where you're coming from. It just doesn't seem fair does it? I'm really sorry you're going through this too, it makes life so much more harder ### God this sounds AWFUL. I‚Äôm so sorry OP. I have contamination OCD, and I can‚Äôt even think about having sex without getting intrusive thoughts. OCD really is the biggest cock blocker of them all, eh? ### While waiting for your appointments a good practice to start is avoid ""arguing"" with the OCD.

You know that you havent gotten her pregnant, spending ages reasoning it out wont change what you already know. You'll just be met with ""What if? What if?"" over and over.

So, you need to remove the fear from the worry, thats a core part on how you start letting go. So she's not pregnant, but hey, if she was? It'd be okay. Wouldn't be the first person to have a kid at 22. You'd find a way to handle it, it wont be the end of the world.

I'm sure when you imagine it you feel a knot in your stomach. Push through, take a few deep breaths to stop panicking and accept it. ""Okay, wouldnt be ideal, but I could do this or this - I'd have this support here and options there"" Ground the fear, take away its power.

When you start allowing yourself to realise how the worry wouldnt be the most awful thing ever, then the comfort of the reality (She's not pregnant) can settle in. ### Yes, that was the post I was referring to. It helps that someone else experiences this. Thank you. ### How did you make it better? ### This gives me hope thank you for commenting this ### haha it sure is

Shit hit the fan with COVID. I ended up getting prescribed 4 mg Xanax a day (what the fuck) and developed a drinking problem. Those were the only two things that helped. 

COVID introduced a fearful state of paranoia that resulted in what I believe to be psychosis, severe insomnia and complete isolation. 

It sucks. ### 3 Things: 
The first was therapy. I used to think I was weak for having never ending/fucked up thoughts. Understanding through therapy that I wasn't weak was the first step to managing my ocd. Once I was able to remove the guilt, the obsessive thoughts became SO much easier to bear and then deal with.    

The second part was drastically changing up my social circle. It is extremely important that you have people in your life who don't needlessly exacerbate ocd. In my case, that means having friends/loved ones who are very matter of fact and who will speak to me in terms of percentages. Having people in my life who understand ocd and have the capacity to be linguistically black and white are healthy for me.

The third part was when I met a doctor named Josh Reilly. We aren't really in touch now but the hour long conversation we had quite factually changed my life. He said that OCD was exscerbated by a micronutrient deficiency. At the point when I had this conversation I was lucky enough to be able to spend a fairly generous amount of money on food, so I really changed up what I ate. I stopped focusing on things that I didn't want/wasn't going to eat and started focusing on making every single meal as nutrient dense as possible.

This story is mine and mine alone. I do not mean to imply what people who have OCD in general should or should not do to manage their own ocd. All I know is that the 12 year old version of me who washed their hands 'till they would bleed and the 22 year old version of me who almost killed themselves from being drowned in self-imposed rituals is so, so fucking grateful for the three things I mentioned above.üß° ### i wouldn't recommend drinking and taking psych meds at the same time.. ### Damnnnnn 4mg??? My doctor would never! It‚Äôs like pulling teeth tryna get any of the helpful drugs from my doctors, they wouldn‚Äôt give me any benzos for a few years. I get them in small doses now, but they keep handing me anti depressants like candy. Ironic huh. 

The isolation is so real. I hardly leave the house. I don‚Äôt have any mates irl with OCD, so they just don‚Äôt get it when I find it hard to go out. ### Dude I constantly think I'm going to do something ridiculous and be totally out of control or something will happen to me. It's just awful. 

What are you on in terms of meds? What is the dosage on the benzos and what kind? ### I feel the same. I feel really lonely too, tryna date with contamination OCD is a joke. Especially trying to tell the person, I told one person I was getting close to and they just kept being like aww that‚Äôs so cute!!! Like can you not my brain literally tells me to do awful things. It‚Äôs not cute. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre so worried ugh it really sucks. You‚Äôre not alone. 

Oh god good question. Clonazapam, 0.5mg i think. They only give me like 10 at a time, too. Tried starting me on Matazipine (that‚Äôs totally not how you spell it) yday and I reacted so bad. I feel like most drugs just effect my nervous system something terrible.

I want to give you a few examples of things I do now, but didn't do before I developed this type. I know wonder... am I wrong though to do this? Is it really just the OCD, or are some things ""reasonable""?

Oh yeah, and I wanna emphasize - well, my fear is not of getting sick. I'm scared of being unhygienic, dirty, spreading things that are disgusting to others, and they would find me disgusting. 

  
**TW, some stuff is a bit gross (bodily fluids)**  


\- If my tooth brush touches parts of the sink or other parts in the bathroom and I haven't cleaned it before, I throw it away

\- I have to wash my hands if I touch my ears by accident because I'm scared there might be something from them on my hands. The same goes for my belly button (through clothing) or sometimes even my butt, through clothes

\- I'm female, I always only used the normal toilet paper after peeing. Now, I read somewhere that it can be good to wash your female parts also with water and normal toilet paper. However, this spirals out of control sometimes.

\- I sometimes have the urge to shower after visiting the toilet. I feel my butt is dirty and if I put up my underwear and pants, they are contaminated (plus my hands - I put my pants up after handwashing first).

\- I live upstairs and my washing machine is in the basement which is not the cleanest I gotta say. I use my house shoes downstairs, and leave them outside before entering my home again because I'm scared there might be E.coli or pee somewhere. I do the same after I come back home...

\- I disinfect my jacket.

\- Throw away pillows or bed sheets because they are contaminated

\- Scared I haven't washed my hands properly if I touch parts of the sink (same as with toothbrush)

\- washing my groceries because I'm scared someone else might have touched them with dirty hands before; because of outside bacteria

\- feeling I need to repeat disinfecting or washing because I forgot a part of my finger, not having done exactly 20-30 seconds, etc. 

\- I am scared of accidentally putting stuff on the ground outside, like shopping bags.

tg1bc4,"Encouragement for the hopeless I offered these thoughts elsewhere to someone struggling with suicidal ideation brought on by ocd, and I thought it might help some in our community here, too: 

I think anyone with moderate or severe ocd has thoughts of suicide at one point or another. I‚Äôve had them for many years. Well over a decade. And never come close to making a plan or anything dangerous. I‚Äôm just absolutely tired of my mind. I‚Äôm sick of it. I want it to shut up and leave me alone and I don‚Äôt want to keep having to fight.

The core of what makes ocd so hard to fight is that it‚Äôs a passive kind of fighting. You can‚Äôt fight it directly. You can‚Äôt argue with the thoughts, try to get rid of them, or act compulsively. All the usual ways we ‚Äúfix‚Äù problems which cause anxiety only make this worse! So we end up fighting for our lives to be free and literally all of our fighting makes ocd stronger. It‚Äôs a circle in hell. 

Even once you realize that you have to stop fighting and accept uncertainty and do nothing‚Äîno engaging the thoughts, no getting rid of them, just accepting that they are thoughts and choosing to act in some meaningful way‚Äîit‚Äôs still a fight with your mind. Because your mind has been trained to respond to ocd as if it were real and important. Now you have to consciously correct your brain and say, ‚ÄúNo, brain. We aren‚Äôt doing this.‚Äù And that is exhausting. I think people grossly underestimate the physical exhaustion involved in ocd. Constant fight-or-flight wears you out.

So it makes total sense why this is hard for us and why at times we want to give up. But I‚Äôm telling you that you will be okay. I‚Äôm not saying that your fears will never be realized (that would be reassurance!). I‚Äôm just saying that your existence is a gift, even when it feels like a curse. I‚Äôm sorry it is also a burden to carry. But you can get through this. You‚Äôll need to accept suffering, but if you get treatment and commit to it, you‚Äôll look back on this moment one day and thank God that you never acted on those thoughts. Trust me. I‚Äôve been there many many times.

I can recall sitting in a college classroom ruminating about jumping off a roof, ignoring the lecture and fixating on this ideation because it felt better than ruminating on my actual obsession. I was so depressed and desperate and hopeless. I felt damned. And the thing is, I look back on that ocd theme and laugh. What a ridiculous fear! It was so irrational! And to think that I considered, even for a second, ending my life for something so petty and meaningless.

Keep your head up. You will get through this. Don‚Äôt worry, feel guilty, or freak out when you get these thoughts. Just have some self compassion. What you are living through is very difficult. You will feel hopeless at times. But trust that you are not hopeless and act. Trust that God is merciful and gracious. Keep acting.

tfumej,"I put my clothes in my closet after coming home, and im very proud of myself So, I've had ocd for a long time now, especially order ocd, but it never bothered me,infact it helped me in some ways,but i developed contamination ocd during the pandemic and... it crippled me, in a lot of different ways it  limited me, stopped me from doing things i loved, stopped me from being who i was, who i liked being,i used to be an extroverted person with somewhat of a plan, an outlook for myself,but during the pandemic i changed, i couldn't go out of my own room, i couldn't properly move, sit and behave
I started going to therapy last year, at first it didn't help that much,but then i changed my therapist and it helped a lot 
One of the things i struggled with a lot were my clothes, i had to immediately dispose of them and wash them when i came home, and my therapist gave me some exercises to help me stop doing that but the thing i struggled with was just simply folding them and putting them in my closet( especially pants/trousers) , he gave me this exercises multiple times and i didn't do it every time 
But tonight... i just did it, after i came home from a restaurant first i accidentally put my ""dirty"" jacket on my pillow (the most sacred and ""must be clean"" possession of mine) and then i folded my pants/trousers and shirt and put them in my closet alongside my jacket like i used to. Thanks to therapy I've done this with shirts and jackets and coats before, but pants have always been the dirtiest and were impossible for me to handle,untill now.

It wasn't even prompted by anything,i don't use any medication and i haven't seen or talked to my therapist for more than a month now (because of a surgery) and i cant wait to tell him, i just thought to myself "" im gonna get home and do it"" 
I know this wont suddenly change everything and cure my ocd, i was just in a good mood and did it, but its a pretty big step for me and im happy with myself",2,2022-03-16 18:12:58-04:00,I‚Äôm so proud of you!

tg7s18,"who else hates not being able to distinguish real fear from OCD? My worst OCD trigger is smells because of OCD contamination (noxious smells means health hazards means getting sick/dying). On top of that I actually experience alot of physical symptoms (headaches, shortness of breath) easily in response to stress, allergies, not sleeping, etc. My friend spilled some auto seam sealant into the insulation of my RV van trying to fill a hole in the roof, and I can't get it out without tearing apart my cabinets, insulation, etc. The smell was horrendous the first day, not as bad now but now I know it's in there and I've been compulsing for days reading about toxic chemical solvents in the sealant, offgassing durations, etc. It's 5 am where I am and I literally can't sleep. I read Particle board can off gas for five frickin years. I read that the ingredients in my sealant are some of the most toxic VOCs out there. I feel incredibly stupid for listening to my friend and using this stuff. I've also been compulsing in the form of reassurance seeking which gives me temporary relief but then it comes right back. No one can reassure me and I'm having intrusive images of being in my van and inhaling toxic fumes for months to come and getting sick or having to sell off my van. This was my dream van to travel and I can't believe this is happening. I've never wanted to have an OCD trigger with my van and I'm so depressed.

tfst67,DO YOU EVER FEEL LIKE YOU ARE FAKING YOUR OCD? I've had it for 11y and i still feel like this alot,11,2022-03-16 16:50:16-04:00,"Yeah. My therapist said it's OCD to think this way too. Then I panic because I feel like I've convinced everyone I have OCD when I don't. Then my therapist said they can spot when someone is faking it. Then I thought omg I really became a bad person, I must've been so manipulative that I've managed to trick 2 psychiatrists and a psychotherapist. As I write this, I'm thinking that I'm faking it and I'm manipulating not only others but myself too. I don't know what feeling is true or not anymore. Then I realised how dumb it all sounded. But on the other hand it doesn't sound dumb and I could just be a sociopath or narcissist or I truly am so manipulative. I hate OCD :( I still have this fear though. ### i feel like im faking everything ive ever been diagnosed with/treated for. When i had an eating disorder, i thought that I was just ‚Äútrying to have an eating disorder because i am huge and pathetic‚Äù


my imposter syndrome runs so deep that i was convinced i had multiple personalites because every thought had a million arguments against it. I dissected myself, 24/7, and still struggle with this although it has become manageable. 

I spent years chasing the ‚Äúyolk‚Äù of myself (my true thoughts and ideas) and couldnt see how my brain was fighting itself into complete distrust. 
My OCD was the liar the whole time, never me. ### Every time I'm doing exceptionally better, I get thoughts like that. And get worried that I've tricked my family, therapist and friends. The most absurd thought it brings up is somethihng along the lines of 'you know you are faking OCD but are just in denial of it' like wtf??? I know it sounds really weird and absurd when I type it out lmao. But when it pops out in my mind randomly it's pretty unnerving. ### I've had it for 9+ years and I don't know what aspects of myself are OCD or my actual personality anymore ### With the theme I have ( I won't say which one as it may be a trigger for some of you) it feels like I'm forcing myself to be anxious. I want this to end and return to myself. ### This is extremely normal with ocd. Label it and move on. ### Yup, I dont know a sufferer who doesnt unfortunately.  

Being diagnosed is a big help - makes it knowable, makes it treatable. So since its a bit of a source of comfort, OCD obviously wants you to doubt it. Just remind yourself thats just more evidence you're diagnosed correctly. ### I‚Äôm low key OCD I don‚Äôt even tell my doctor this, I was diagnosed with adhd and bi polar 2, however I have intrusive thoughts that don‚Äôt go away. It reappears right when I wake up in the morning. But I still wonder if I am faking it so I don‚Äôt tell anyone because it sounds crazy. I‚Äôve done some irrational things do to it ### Feel you fam.

I would occasionally get paranoid that I hit a pedestrian on the sidewalk but I would be fine later. Now, I feel like I ruminate over every single little thing. I think the root of my issue is that I don‚Äôt feel like I deserve to live life this good? How can everything be going so good? In my mind I feel like it‚Äôs too good to be true.

Going to the gym helps me get my mind off of whatever I‚Äôm thinking about, usually. A big issue for me too is sleeping at night. That‚Äôs usually when my mind travels. I‚Äôve been taking CBD or a little bit of THC here and there, like once a week or two. It relaxes me a lot but I don‚Äôt want to rely on a substance like that. ### Yes! That‚Äôs exactly how I feel. I worry about losing people constantly too and it doesn‚Äôt even make sense.

tg0xej,"Just right OCD 
I suffer what I‚Äôve come to discover as ‚Äújust right‚Äù  (or ‚Äúnot just right‚Äù?) OCD. Essentially, rather than getting bad intrusive thoughts I just get a really weird uncomfortable feeling, like something isn‚Äôt right. and although I‚Äôve been on medication, and it‚Äôs been better recently because of them, the past week or so it‚Äôs started to be a lot worse again. 

The most major thing that consistently affects me is having to make things even in both sides of my body. (Ex, if one shoe is tighter I need to make the other one the same, or if a drop of water lands on my arm I need to do it in the exact place on the other, etc). Luckily this one is more of an inconvenience rather than super badly affecting my life atm. I think the most stressful and frustrating things recently have been the need to reach certain ‚Äúscroll points‚Äù on my phone. When I scroll through Instagram, a post has to touch the top and bottom of the screen twice before I can move on. And in cases where it‚Äôs formatted differently, this is really really frustrating. This is also the case on pdfs and lots of other computer stuff. I also have developed an obsession with cracking my neck the way most people crack their knuckles, but I have to do it so much that I can no longer actually crack my neck and it just creates painful strain and I feel like I look like an idiot doing it every 5 seconds all the time every day. 

Probably lots of other stuff as well, but for now this is just kind of a post I‚Äôm making out of frustration and desperation. I know that this stuff isn‚Äôt near as life threatening as things many others with OCD experience and my heart absolutely goes out to all of you. I Would love to hear some feedback/reassurance on this stuff, as I‚Äôve never really talked to anyone with these same issues :,)",7,2022-03-16 23:32:25-04:00,"i literally JUST made a post about this. i am struggling with it pretty bad currently. sometimes i go through these episodes where i cannot focus on anything else except picking, tapping, cracking knuckles, etc. I even do it to the point where my knuckles are sore. but for some reason i can‚Äôt stop doing it. i haven‚Äôt been officially diagnosed with OCD yet (i‚Äôve been told by a counselor i have it, but not an official diagnosis) but i wasn‚Äôt sure if this was even a part of it since it‚Äôs not typically related to the obsession, anxiety, compulsion, relief cycle. i think i just need to look more into it maybe ### Omg I have this too. My earliest memories of having OCD as a child are when I would get upset at my parents if they didn‚Äôt put my socks on perfectly straight. I‚Äôm still like this to this day, and if they aren‚Äôt on perfectly it bothers me so much to the point that I need to fix it or take my shoe off to adjust it. I also have the need for both shoes to be the exact same in terms of how tight they‚Äôre laced up; as a kid I had this issue with skates and if they weren‚Äôt laced up equally tight I would ask my parents to redo them. ### Myn are these too I wanted make a post about but you made it for me ### yes i‚Äôve lived with just right ocd my whole life :) it‚Äôs gotten so extreme before that things i visualize in my head has to be even. (if i imagine a car turning right, then i HAVE to imagine a car turning left) and i also get stuck in patterns. AB and then mirror that, BA and then mirror that whole thing BAAB. ### Definitely do!! It‚Äôs really frustrating and becomes a hassle and painful at certain points for me as well. ### Yup that‚Äôs totally it!

tgaont,"I'm scared (tw: health anxiety) My ocd is the worst ever and I'm really struggling. I don't get out much anymore and spend all day inside which I know is terrible for my mental health and my ocd is getting worse. I'm having so many intrusive thoughts and now for the first time ever health anxiety. For hours yesterday I was on the edge of a panic attack and it felt awful and I couldn't sleep at all last night. The night before I kept waking up to my brain saying ""there's something you should be anxious over right now"". I saw a lump in a mushroom and couldn't eat that mushroom in case it gave me a tumour (I'm surprised I could type the word). I can't even watch TV because I get triggered when I heard health related words. I don't know what to do because I'm not in my home country and won't be for a long time, I feel like I need medication for the first time in my life. 

Its so bad, it doesn't stop. I'm constantly in my head, my head is always telling me I hate myself. I am feeling nauseated all the time from being so anxious. I wish I could sleep. 

Losing sleep and stressing is also making it so much worse because my mind is now telling me I'm going to die younger now because of it.",3,2022-03-17 09:49:34-04:00,"Sounds like youre letting it have all the power unfortunately (not a criticism, thats so easy to do).

Whenever you know an action makes things worse (staying in all the time, checking something you've already checked, etc), and you do it anyway, you're making your OCD stronger. You're letting your imbalanced emotions win over your logical thoughts. From the sounds of it youre losing each battle and its making you retreat more and more into your shell.

I can obviously tell you ""Go outside more"" or ""Fight the urges"", but you already know thats what you should be doing, I know how hard it can be to resist. So really I'd say you need to talk to someone, get some person-to-person contact that can guide you as you build better habits back into place.

As an addendum - I used to find it really hard to sleep. I'd recommend some of these sleep apps that are out there (like Headspace). I personally even listen to podcasts using a sleep headband with headphones built in for comfort - works like a charm.

She deserves some kudos for communicating with you about what she's experiencing. Maybe you should buy her a new pair of earrings. ### I'm going to add here: yes! Please be patient! As someone with OCD who is living with her parents while trying to get it under control, I know it's frustrating for everyone. But it's likely harder for your friend because she more than likely knows it's her OCD but can't seem to fight it. Anything you're thinking, she's probably thinking too, so it wouldn't help for you to double down on the frustration. 

My top suggestion would be to simply ask her how best she'd like you to communicate with her. It's ok to be open about it.

Example: start by asking her how her OCD tends to manifest and see if she'd be ok with you pointing it out when you notice the traits coming out. If she says it manifests in ways that make her want to buy things if she forgets them at home, then later she wants to buy earrings because she forgot hers, say ""ok sure! We can go do that if you'd like, but that sounds like it could be your OCD based on our previous discussion."" It may not make her NOT want to follow through with the compulsion but it could help to ground her. Of course, if she doesn't want this, then perhaps you can find another way to help her in these times.

Also, it is inevitable that you will get frustrated with her OCD. That's nothing to be ashamed about or feel guilty for. But another thing that could help is, when you're feeling frustrated at what seems to be her OCD, try to say just that: that it's her OCD you're annoyed with, NOT HER. It may be difficult for her to recognize that in the moment.

I will say that this is all a fine line to walk because sometimes it's tough to see what is OCD and what's not. Patience and communication is key. ### I don‚Äôt see a problem. People should respect peoples mask decisions in general especially in the time we are in. You don‚Äôt have to not have OCD to do that. And what‚Äôs wrong with going earring shopping rq. If she needed to stop for gas or food rq you‚Äôd think it‚Äôs fine.

Idk maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm OCD too but I genuinely think that those are really small things to be upset about with your friend OCD or not. I know you‚Äôre probably just trying to think of examples but that ain‚Äôt it. ### OCD creates a feeling of real danger when reacting to an obsession. 

Your friends OCD might be saying: Mask comes off -> I will get COVID -> I will die from COVID. 

It's a subconscious thing that happens. It's functionally the equivalent of a Karen freaking out and calling the cops because someone decided to exist in a public space. 0 to 10. No stop.

Now that's the OCD. OCD is a Karen. Your friend has a completely other side to them and they are watching their brain go 0 to 10 in a way that makes absolutely no sense to them. 

Your friend is just listening to their OCD screaming at them. And it feels the exact same, if you ever worked customer service, and met those people (0 to 10.) Dealing with the stress of listening to that unreasonable thing scream at you, you never get used to it. It makes no sense, but you want it to stop so you do what it says.

That's my best analogy for it at least. Hope this helps, but please be patient with your friend. ### Okay! I will. Thank you! ### Thanks for your informed answer :) ### I was also thinking people have their own comfort levels in regards to being around people wearing masks or not regardless of whether they have ocd. I also don't understand why op cares if her friend buys new earrings unless she didn't have the money to and asked op to pay for them or unless buying the earrings delayed other plans they had made together. I'm unsure if buying new earrings would even be related to ocd. It's possible, but it's possible she just is more comfortable wearing earrings when out. I could see this behaviour being a problem if she's buying real jewelry that is expensive and this is happening frequently ( unless she's very rich), but if she's buying cheap costume jewelry that she can afford even if it's happening frequently I don't see it being much of a problem. ### Please don‚Äôt try to encourage your friend NOT to wear a mask‚Ä¶ that has nothing to do with OCD in general. That is for actual protection. ### I'm confused by that too, but OCD has a weird 2+2=5 things with some compulsions. Time taken to buy them is also a cost. I've spent an hour trying to buy something before because my OCD told me it didn't like something about it. ### I did say if her buying earrings delayed other plans I could see it being annoying, but if that happened op didn't mention it. ### Then excuse me, I missed that part. My bad. ### ",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tgfq3q/friend_with_ocd/

these daydreams have literally thrown me into episodes of depression, moral ocd, relationship ocd, body dysmorphia, etc. which is very counter productive considering i daydream to get AWAY from these issues.

and i can't just ""rewrite"" my daydreams the way i want them to go, it has to be based on real people and be as realistic as possible or else it won't work. and i can't stop myself from obsessing. i feel absolutely insane.",2,2022-03-17 03:44:47-04:00,"I hadn‚Äôt heard of maladaptive daydreams before.

This drivers me crazy as I'm unable to do aynthing while there is noise around me. They will probably be here all day and I don't want my day being ruined. What should I do.",8,2022-03-17 03:39:47-04:00,"It's possible that what you describe is physical and the OCD just makes it worse. I have some things called misophonia and Tonic Tensor Tympani Syndrome (TTTS) these tend to be more common with tinnitus, which I have had permanently for over 30 years.

The misophonia can give me a full on adrenalin rush when there are loud sounds especially in the bass range like a car with a booming stereo driving down the street or even the rumbling of a truck engine. It seems different if I'm expecting it like I'm at a concert, then I would interpret the exact same body sensations as excitement instead of rage or terror. But I don't enjoy going to movie theaters because the volume is almost always way too loud. At the other end of the spectrum, the noises from people eating food makes my skin crawl, this seems to be especially common with ASD. If I am eating myself it's much less noticeable, or I just put on headphones.

The tensor tympani is a muscle that tightens the ear drum to protect your ears when there are loud sounds and sometimes it can go into spasms and stay tight or start fluttering. When you swallow, this muscle responds to the changes in pressure and causes the clicking sounds that you hear. When the muscle starts fluttering it kind of sounds like when you have water inside your ear.

Mindfulness meditation helped me somehow after months of practice. I may still have the same initial reaction, but can kind of calm myself down and have compassion for myself and not ruminate over it for hours. I have some alexithymia, which is difficulty identifying and describing emotions and also somatoform obsessions. So, I have had episodes of misidentifying physical sensations as emotions or emotions as something physically wrong with me. Just becoming aware of that has been helpful and being less attached to my instinctive interpretation. ### I live in a bottom floor apartment and the noise is out of control from multiple neighbors and the street right by me. I‚Äôve had to purchase eat plugs and I wear them around. It helps a lot ! ### can relate, it's getting more and more difficult to do anything due to noise that I haven't chosen to listen to (tv/music) and even then I can get overwhelmed fast by it ### wow had not idea what misophonia was, think I have it. thank you for this comment ### I considered getting ear plugs too but I also can feel the noise in my body. Like if you're on a concert and feel the loud music.

I've changed my sleep schedule so I would be awake during the night and sleep during the day. But either way it's just horrible.

I wanted to get myself hospitalized because of this but with the virus being a thing I keep holding off going. ### I'm currently listening to Lisa Feldman Barrett's book How Emotions Are Made and that has been very helpful. I have alexithymia and have had somatoform obsessions and have confused emotions with physical symptoms and vice versa, like thinking symptoms from GERD meant I was upset all the time. Barrett's work has helped me to understand that emotions are just the brain's best guess and are neither as inherent nor objective as we have been socialized to believe. Like how I would interpret the body sensations from loud sounds completely differently depending on the context.

tfysel,"Help me help my husband I don't have OCD but my husband was recently diagnosed.

The journey from there to here has been hellish for him. Years of misdiagnosis, pill after pill that - at best did nothing, at worst made him really sick. 

We are relieved to have the correct diagnosis, so now the real journey is about to begin.

I joined this group a month ago as a lurker. I was hoping it would give me insight into how my husband is feeling - and it has! So thank you all for that.

Now I feel it's time to reach out to the community to ask directly- what could your partner do (whether or not you have one) to make your day a little easier?

My husband suffers with repetitive thoughts. The thoughts themselves appear to be unrelated to current events, but they are triggered by such. 

For example, at the moment he cannot stop thinking about a friend he had in high school who accidentally had his fingers cut off in an accident. My husband was there and saw the whole thing, how his mind is telling him repeatedly that this guy is going to find him and blame him for the incident.

Not only does my husband live thousands of miles away from his hometown, he has long since lost contact with this person (it happened over 20 years ago) and the incident was not his fault at all - he was merely a witness.

These thoughts are plaguing him and have been going on for the best part of 6 months - that anf numerous other thoughts too numerous to go into detail about here.

He is exhausted by trying to push these thoughts away and in some cases, partaking in simple chores and family stuff helps, but after so long, he crashes out again and goes through an 'attack time's as he describes it.

I know I don't gave a magic wand that can take this from him (I wish I had) but I want to be a good supportive wife to him - and we are both trying to figure this all out.

Another thing is that due to reasons, we have to live in seperate countries for the next 6 months. Me and our daughter are in the UK and he is Turkey. This situation is unavoidable but I fear it has triggered him further.

Any advice would be appreciated.

Thank you!",9,2022-03-16 21:38:07-04:00,"Therapy with an OCD specialist could help. I have pure OCD and feel that NAC has made it manageable. It's an OTC supplement. Google 'OCD and NAC.' Inositol has also been proven to help OCD. 

I'm still nowhere near 'cured,' but it's so much better than it used to be. ### The fact you're here and asking means you care for him and support him and sometimes that's all we need. Just a shoulder to cry on with complete non judgement. A lot of people don't have a partner like that. ### Just empathy, really. Show him you love him especially when his OCD is bad. Good luck to you both üíô ### My OCD mostly manifests as cleaning compulsions, not so much rumination, so please take this with a grain of salt. I'm currently living with my parents even though I have my own house because it's just safer for me to be here right now. It's been tough on all of us because it feels so suddenly severe and they have to help me out with a lot. I've had them talk with my therapist to learn about what I'm going through and the best way to support me. One thing that I think may be most helpful is, if he's telling you about his obsessions, say ""this may be your OCD."" (If he's been going to therapy, you can step it up and definitively say ""this is your OCD.""). Call it out. It doesn't necessarily help me to break out of my compulsion but it at least helps to ground me. 

I think you're already doing a great thing by reaching out to ask how you can best support him! Just keep doing your best! My dad can be harsh and slips up by saying ""just get over it"" and other such things but even with statements like that, I know he's just doing his best to help. (Speaking of, if you ever get frustrated with the ruminations, make sure you make it clear that it's his OCD you're frustrated at, not him. It's not always clear during an attack.) Point being: you're husband notices, I'm sure. ### You‚Äôre so flipping awesome for being here for his sake. Man, he‚Äôs so very lucky to have you supporting him! You should feel proud. I‚Äôm so sorry he‚Äôs dealing with all of that! OCD is a life ruiner. It really sucks. Honestly the biggest thing for me is to have someone just there to listen. It‚Äôs very frustrating when someone thinks they‚Äôre being helpful by just continuously saying it‚Äôs not real and it‚Äôs in your head! (Can you tell I‚Äôve got a family member who does this lol) so making him feel heard imo is really important. And just the little things. Asking how he‚Äôs feeling at the moment, asking what you can do to help, just being there and keeping him company when he‚Äôs really bad etc. If you‚Äôre doing long distance, check in texts are super awesome. Just a little hey just thinking of you, hope you‚Äôre okay, let me know if I can help sorta thing. Sorry I can‚Äôt give more advice as a single gal I haven‚Äôt had this happen! But you‚Äôre just so awesome for doing this. Hope you know that! ### I‚Äôd suggest continuing to be there for him.  Encourage him to seek therapy from a knowledgeable counselor to use Exposure Response Prevention or Acceptance Commitment Therapy to begin the healing process.  A ssri can help with anxiety or depression if that is an issue.  

Looking at the International OCD Foundation can help you as they have resources for partners or family members.  

Good luck to you both. ### Seconding therapy with an ocd specialist. If he is ready to tackle his ocd he needs to work on exposure and response prevention and cutting compulsions. Example: pushing thoughts away is avpidant and not going to help him get better. Facing the thoughts head on is the. B Est treatment but it's hard and scary.

As. For what you can do I'd suggest researching for yourself about reassurance seeking and partcipitating in compulsions. If he's ready to take these steps, try to not reassure him as to the content of his ocd. Listening and giving physical affection is OK if he's troubled or a sorry you're hurting, but reassuring he's a good person, hasn't done something wrong is giving into his ocd.


For me when I'm having a tough ocd day I'd rather be left alone to listen to my thoughts more clearly and work them out but everyone is different. During the course of therapy I wanted to be left alone a lot because it was extremely draining and mentally exhausting, my husband was thankfully super supportive. Therapy can be a life change and really minimize the impact of ocd in the long run (I won't say cure because I don't think this is possibly, there will still be flare ups time to time but shorter and less severe) ### I've noticed that when I'm ruminating sometimes my husband will completely change the subject even though in normal conversation that might be rude it's very helpful ### Hi! I have PureOCD. I was diagnosed last year but have had it since at least 4 years old (I'm 42). 

Here are the things that have helped.  In order of significance:

1. A combo of CBD and THC (indica). This stops my thoughts in their tracks.  I tried quitting for 7 days recently and fell into an attack (and I knew if I smoked I would feel better but my OCD attack was about smoking it...). I caved and smoked and within 5 minutes my level of ocd went from a 10 to a 1. It has been great at keeping my ocd mind calm (with the occasional attacks). And I'm so much happier. 

2. Therapy.  I went through nocd.com it was a game changer. ERP therapy is the gold standard to healing. So much so my ocd has gone from month long stretches of 10 days to being dormant for 6+months at a time. They even take some insurance and hsa cards.

3. Being Diagnosed!!!! ‚úîÔ∏è

4. Having a loving partner who is on this journey with you!! ‚úîÔ∏è ### ",6,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tfysel/help_me_help_my_husband/
tg49gg,"Should I have these symptoms checked as ocd? Hello, I am 23 years old, female at birth, and I don't know anything about OCD past the stereotypes mainly, so I hope I'm not insulting anyone by coming here with questions that may seem rude or misguided in anyway. 
Normally when trying to explain how I feel to people or what they are going with however, it's hard to articulate that in a way that is familiar to them? Or in a way that they understand. I don't believe I get too detailed or graphic but just in case I do mention my eating habits, I touch a bit on skin picking but I tried to keep it very non graphic, and I do touch on excessive hand washing with hot water but I don't know what it would be called, lastly I also give a brief example of the kind of paranoid thoughts I think. I tried going over the guidelines and I believe only 2 types of ocd weren't allowed to be mentioned so I hope I'm not just misunderstanding and am still following the guidelines as intended.

I've definitely dealt with skin picking, I won't go into any graphic details since I don't know what could hurt anyone (again new ground for me here), but I would definitely say that it gets pretty excessive and can lead to some nasty injuries. This has been ongoing since early elementary. Possibly earlier. It's not something I feel I can confidently stop.

Every single night I need to check the bottom of the bed and the closet. Usually multiple times if I convince myself that I totally forgot and there is DEFINITELY something there. My guess is this habit developed early from childhood with the belief I tell myself every night that ""tonight could be the night someone comes to hurt me.""

Sometimes if there's a song I like I can get a single line of it stuck in my head, sometimes as little as three words, and it will play in my head on loop until it goes from mildly annoying to genuinely distressing to the point I want to cry because I get stuck on those lyrics again and again. This has prevented me from sleeping well many times which can lead to my thoughts spiralling uncontrollably for the night. 
When I try to explain this I usually get a ""try to think more positively!"", Or ""try and write down your feelings.""
Helpful words in meaning but in practice it's more than a bit frustrating to be instructed to behave or think positively if your mind just refuses to do so or if you feel physically unable to do so.

I'm not sure if this would count as related but I can definitely become extremely hyper focused on things I take interest with, usually art related, if I watch something with puppets I get extremely compelled to make a puppet, almost like a need, if I discover a craft channel and they are doing something random I haven't tried in a long time like painting rocks I will feel like I HAVE to paint rocks. I usually begin to feel extremely upset when I can't do those sorts of things even if I've never done them prior. 
And this usually can lead to a lot of burnout because whenever I practice the art I primarily do (digital 2d characters and enviornments) I will find it nearly impossible, if not fully impossible, to focus on anything other than what I am focused on in that moment, and said interests can change drastically, one week it'll be vampires, the next if I can't make a puppet I'll draw a puppet, after that mermaids, it often loops between something of that nature. And suddenly every character I have will follow that pattern, designs I had set in stone MUST change or I start to feel extremely upset and overwhelmed. I lose all focus if I try and focus on something I was fine on focusing on just a day or so prior. This makes focusing on anything a rather frustrating endeavor. 
Anytime I can't focus I then get a feedback loop of negative thoughts that I usually can't break out of since mentally I believe I am ""proving"" those types of thoughts. And it becomes my sort of temporarily accepted reality. 

I usually have extremely obsessive thoughts that everyone is going to turn on me and I've never fully been able to get rid of them but I would think they happen on a rather daily basis even if I regularly am shown that isn't the case. However I can also see that overlapping with abandonement issues and or my generalized anxiety. 

Recently, since the start of the pandemic I've started washing my hand obsessively but to a REALLY obsessive degree. I don't take too long. Or it doesn't feel like that, only about a minute or so I think? But I have to turn the water up to the hottest setting and wash my hands multiple times, singing the same tune or I won't be convinced they are clean enough. It's started changing the texture of my skin and causing injuries but even in the moment I usually can't convince myself they are clean enough if I DON'T wash them this way, and not washing them the ""right"" way can cause me to start feeling, again, extremely distressed. 

My food also needs to be a very certain way, at certain times when I feel a specific way or I can't eat because it will feel extremely disgusting. To elaborate, if the texture of something dry is too wet I won't eat it, if two foods touch with different textures that I don't believe mesh well I can't eat it, if a food has a certain scent, I can't eat, if the taste changes then it's the same problem, sight also is a big factor (this has thankfully improved a bit I think but was ongoing for about a few years now? I wasn't fed much as a child and have only recently begun eating regularly again in recent years and food and I haven't meshed well since than so I can see this being an unrelated problem.)

As an overall summary of my life in general if it helps to add context, I am slightly underweight, I've been going for walks more though not for long at all, only the last week or so, so I am pretty unhealthy admittedly. 
Is it possible to develop OCD later in life due to traumatic events or is it more like something you are born with? Again sorry if my questions are at all insulting, I am just trying to find answers and I hope I haven't hurt anyone in doing so with my very limited knowledge on the subject. 

My family has a large load of mental problems from my mom's side and a bit from my dad's side though not as severe. My brother was diagnosed with autism and my mom claimed to have OCD (she was known to be an unreliable narrator who would lie about what her doctors did or didn't say so I can't be sure.)
She also had bipolar disorder, I THINK, according to herself at least. But she later called the doctor an idiot and revised this claim based on what she thought, then said another doctor told her it was a lie I believe. 
This may seem irrelevant but it leads to the overarching question at hand. 
Does this all sound like it could be OCD I should ask the therapist I'll be going to to look into for help, or could it be something else?
I have therapy soon and wanted to address any concerns directly to her as in the past any time I shy away from this I was dismissed by former therapists(the hand washing being a good example. I got one sentence in before it was dismissed as common even though it seems to genuinely concern my sister and father from the amount of damage it's been doing to this day.) If you have any insight or could point me to a subreddit that might be able to help if this does not fit what OCD is like it would be very appreciated.

Two years spent on the same subject shows you are fixated. Part of OCD.
How about stop trying to answer the question, leave it alone and get on with your life? ### Gathering evidence to get rid of doubt is like digging to get rid of a hole. I suggest working on being kind and learning to trust yourself again with help. You are the person who you most need to forgive to free your mind from self hatred. At one time, there was hatred in your mind and you intended to do harm, but instead you exterted self control. That was good enough. ### Hi! I think I can help with this one. 

If this thought is causing you real distress and frequent interference, I would strongly consider you see a doctor / psychologist, if you haven't already. It has all the hallmarks of an obsession in the OCD sense - a chronic, discomforting thought that remains unquenchable no matter how much you have tried to combat it with logic. It doesn't matter what the content of the thought is - if it has these characteristics, it's an obsession. 

It's very common in OCD to ruminate over unsolvable questions, like - do I have an invisible, terminal illness? do I even exist? am I going to harm the people I love most? The OCD mind will hate the presence of these thoughts and the reality they suggest. So it will seek out relief by doing compulsions. Seeking reassurance about the untruth of a particular thought is a classic compulsion. And no amount of reassurance will soothe the OCD in a way that will last. The compulsions in fact are what sustains the obsessions, because the OCD mind interprets these compulsions as confirmation that the original thought is important. 

SO: If the thought is consuming a great deal of your time, and causing you frequent discomfort or distress, consider seeing a psychologist / psychiatrist capable of giving you a concrete diagnosis. Because, if this is OCD, there is no answer that anyone could give that would soothe your mind on this question. The treatment is altogether different. ### there is no truth available for mortals ### This isn‚Äôt a question anyone can answer. There are people who have done bad bad things, snap to their senses, turn their life around and become better and wiser than most people around them. Life is a moving, non-linear process. People are more complex than simple labels and definitions.

What does forgiveable even really mean? If I snap at a person, cussing and intimidating them, is that forgivable? Will they forgive me? Did people I wrong small or big ever really forgive me? If they tell others I screamed at them, won‚Äôt it still leave a bad taste in their mouths? Forgiveness can only realistically happen within ourselves. It‚Äôs not tangible externally. I hope this makes sense. ### I ask myself this all the time, im starting to think its not an answerable question. Everyone has a different definition of good and bad and OCD prevents you from accurately gauging how guilty you should feel when you do something wrong (at least in my experience). Notice how your brain tricks you by saying ""You didnt murder/r*** someone but this mean thing you did is BASICALLY that bad so therefore, youre a monster""? Your anxiety wont cut you any slack, it just wants to prove that your guilt is somehow justified. Even if you have done wrong or made mistakes, it doesnt mean you are a bad person or that youre undeserving of humanity. Remember to show yourself the same basic empathy youre willing to show others. ### Thoughts aren‚Äôt unforgivable nor do they make you a bad person. ### If I turn out to be a bad person then why should I get along with my life? I gotta know this for sure first ### Well what has been troubling me most are actions that have been actually committed, I asked around on Reddit a while back if they were actually bad, and the worst thing I have sought forgiveness for was described as ‚Äúa little weird but not really morally wrong.‚Äù And yet I‚Äôm still unable to actually understand if what I did was wrong or not, and if I actually deserve to be free from my rumination. ### I‚Äôm not really looking for objective truth per se, just what is true to most people in terms of unforgivable transgressions ### I mean unforgivable in the sense that your moral slate has been irreparably tainted ### You should just do everything you need to do despite being worthy or unworthy to you until your ocd thoughts lose meaning. ### You won't. It's a cruel irony of OCD. No matter how much energy you put into finding the answer, no matter how much ruminating you do, OCD will not let you find an answer.

By not engaging in thinking about it.  Or by exposing yourself to the thoughts to the the point that your brain just gets bored and doesn‚Äôt want to deal with it anymore.

Far easier to type this than to do it, I know. ### Humans fuck up. 

It happens. 

Who you were then is not who you are now. Forgiving yourself is not condoning what happened or minimizing it, but people cannot make amends or grow if we don't move on. You made a mistake, you feel horrible about it and you are doing your best to never do that again. That's all you can do. 

Everyone has moments they're not proud of. Everyone has skeletons in their closet---sometimes major things and sometimes not. 

When my brain goes on the attack with 'remember xyz thing you did!' I just tell myself some combination of: sometimes I genuinely didn't know any better, I did my best to apologize/make amends, I regret what I did/said and understand now why it was wrong and I am making changes to never do/say xyz again. Then I go do something else and take my mind off it. I've already picked it apart and done my best to understand why xyz thing happened and what I did wrong/what I was thinking and to never do xyz again. There's nothing else I can do. 

People change and they grow. The mark of a 'bad' person is someone who knowingly tries to hurt others and who refuses to apologize/take responsibility and change their behaviour. ### ",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tfy1ns/how_do_i_move_on_real_event_ocd/

Does this have an underlying cause? Or is it just how OCD works for some people? I guess i have somewhat always sort of had it but i only had about two intrusive thoughts that appeared and disappeared throughout my childhood. It never really got bad until one night i had a thought that if i didnt clean my room in under twenty minutes my entire family would be sent to an alternate dimension and id be living with a fake family that wasnt really mine. Ever since then it has escalated a lot and gotten way worse. Mind you i am at high risk for schizophrenia. Is this a mixture of paranoid schizophrenia and OCD or just one or the other?",5,2022-03-16 18:12:27-04:00,"Kind of. I think I had always in a way had some sort of OCD without knowing, always kind of knew my anxiety was more heightened than others. 

One particular day in my mid 20s I was applying for police departments and filling out the background check. These background checks are pretty much a questionnaire of anything you‚Äôve ever done wrong. I thought of one particular thing that I had once done as a kid (nothing bad at all, I ended up getting into departments but had to drop out because my anxiety was so bad), but thought for sure they were going to look at it and arrest me. I had this weird feeling come over me and I‚Äôd say I‚Äôve had OCD ever since. 

At least now about 8 years later I know what it is. I spent those first few months constantly googling people arrested applying for departments, which then turned into other stuff like HOCD. Had no idea what was going on. But I would say that particular moment is when my OCD really developed. ### My current theme I can tie down to developing to a multitude of factors. Mine has to do if I was inappropriate to one of my friends as a teen who was four years younger than me. I remember what exactly kick started it was me telling them that I considered them a good friend of mine, and they said something along the lines of ‚Äúif X friend heard that they‚Äôd probably think it was weird, and Y friend would find it funny I‚Äôm American‚Äù. And that send me in a huge spiral of ‚Äúwhy would it be weird? Have I done anything weird? I never thought it was that weird?‚Äù plus with everyone getting exposed online. Though looking back with some other stuff they said I definitely overreacted to that comment, still a worry though lol ### I specifically remember that mine started in 5th grade while I was reading the Death Note manga. 

Lol obviously the series had nothing to do with it but that memory stood out to me from that time period ### No my trigger was a tv show my family use to watch at night to this day i hate that show i stopped watching it i made my family stop watching that shit i know its not that shows fault but still it made my life hell for 6years now ### I always had social anxiety as a kid. It got pushed under the rug as me being shy. Now, as an adult, I have mostly overcome my social anxiety (to the best of my ability), however, I feel like my anxiety just manifested into a different form. And now, I have OCD.   I feel like the basis of my anxiety can be traced to the way my parents raised me. My mother is very anxious and is constantly pushing her same anxious thoughts into me. I drank at a bar (where I was not IDed) and she told me this whole big story about how the police would take away my license. Mind you, I did not drive. I would never drive drunk. There was no police there. Ever. It‚Äôs a small town bar. So yes, now I see where I get it from ### ",6,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tfum1r/did_anyone_elses_ocd_just_start_randomly_one_day/

tfuhsp,"OCD meds and primary care doc (US) So I am finally coming to realize/accept I might have OCD.  I always thought of it as anxiety (the obsessive thoughts are fears and make me perpetually anxious) and maybe depression (because trying to manage these thoughts makes me exhausted/depressed).  Also, as far as compulsive behaviors, mine are pretty mild.  Some hand-washing, checking things, picky eater, etc.  The compulsions are manageable.

But holy hell, the thoughts.  My brain does not shut the fuck up.  Twenty years of different SSRIs and a variety of therapists and...I am...surviving, but it's a daily battle against the thoughts/fears.

My current therapist suggested I ask for a med change.  Reading the forums here, I saw some hope in meds that I haven't tried: clomipramine, fluvoxamine, maybe mirtazipine?  

So I made an appointment with my PCP, and she's like, 'yeah, you're on an SSRI, right?' (yes, and it's not helping) 'well, SSRIs are the first treatment option for OCD' (yes, and I've tried, like, 8 of them, without much success, I want to try something different) 'Oh, well, you need to try therapy'.  Lady, I'm in therapy and have been for 20 years (some breaks üôÑ).  'Well......there's clomipramine......but we prefer SSRIs.  And therapy.  They're very helpful.'

I totally lost my shit, I started crying I was so frustrated.  I had so much hope going into that conversation.  And some pride, too, that I'm willing/ready to try a new med (meds freak me out).  And yep, *not helpful*.

 Annyyway I am not diagnosed so feel free to delete this if it's not the right sub or against the rules. 
Ever since I was 14, I have had a deep fear/obsession that I experienced sexual assault as a kid that I mentally blocked out. Because researching this stuff calms me down, I've done a ton of research about CSA, and while I fit a lot of the symptoms to a T, I learned that it's extremely extremely rare to completely repress a memory of sexual abuse. People who do block it out still have some memory or idea of either where it happened, who did it, or something along those lines. I have zero memory or anything but have spent hours and hours analyzing every adult I interacted with as a child and any situation it could've happened.

One of my biggest fears is being an abuser in any way, and pocd forces me to mentally review every time I‚Äôve ever been alone with a child to make sure I‚Äôm not an abuser. It destroys me inside to think I could be the source of someone‚Äôs trauma. I don‚Äôt want to be like my abusers, and I never wanted these horrible heavy topics on my mind constantly :(

I definitely encourage you to discuss the symptoms you‚Äôre experiencing with your psychiatrist or diagnostician, though, if you can. ### Come join us in r/CPTSD perhaps? ### Sometimes trauma is stored in the body but your brain absolutely protects you from the memories. I'm a CSA victim and large parts of my childhood are entirely blank. I'm just now starting IFS and EMDR to help draw out the memories and process the feelings.

How?",22,2022-03-16 01:11:05-04:00,"100% relate and frequently consider moving across the planet or at least this continent, starting fresh and perhaps I‚Äôd at least be happier. Total social media wipe, etc. it‚Äôs relatable. Just remember there are absolutely people in your life that care about you, so if you‚Äôre thinking about doing anything beyond a digital reset, please consider the effects those more physical and lasting decisions may make beyond just the internet ones. ### Oh absolutely. Every day I fight the urge to delete all my socials and jump ship to go somewhere no one knows me and I can ‚Äústart new.‚Äù To fight it usually I just try to district myself with a task to steer my focus or watch something to occupy my mind. Also napping. Napping helps me a ton! ### Hey, I can completely relate to this. Want to talk in private, if you're okay with that? ### Yeah. I tend to do this a lot with the photos in my phone, or the history on my computer when I mistype a link or something. It's like I'm projecting my mental clutter out onto the screen and cleansing it in a way I never can with my own brain.

I have yet to conquer this aspect of my OCD, even though I know a *truly* ""clean slate"" is unattainable and would be short-lived anyway. But I still try, against my better judgement.

There are some largely useless but useful-in-a-niche-way things I still keep, though, just in case. Even though I sometimes delete them and then restore them soon after out of panicked regret. It's an annoyance I feel I'm resigned to live with. ### yup ive been factory resetting my phone and laptop for years just as an OCD compulsion.. its absolutly fucking awful and i also have the starting at midnight new month thing for me it could be a new week too but my life is a fucking wreck and i do wanna strt over ### Omfg, yes, all the time. I‚Äôve found that when I get really obsessive about kind of stuff, or when I get stuck in rumination about going back in time and reliving parts of my life, I just need to get off of social media for a couple days. I find what seriously helps is to go do something that requires a lot of focus (or even just have a packed day of doing things and seeing friends) and just leave my phone off for 12 hours. ### I do this all the time I constantly procrastinate at everything and keep myself distracted from reality in entertainment mediums . As I'm a student i should be also focusing on my studies and careers which I don't . I fear I'm gonna end up broke, jobless and a failure in life . And I keep resetting my habits , goals ,mobile and lifestyle and everything and eventually end up ruining it and restarting again and it's a never-ending loop I'm stuck in ### Can definitely relate. ### one of my best friends also has OCD and compulsively deletes all their texts to the point they‚Äôll text me asking to repeat myself because they forgot what I said and can‚Äôt find the text ### Sure ### I can relate to the first paragraph you wrote.

Have you gotten over it? ### Did you get over it? ### And what do you think of it? Does it bother you when they say that? ### Well... I suppose I do it a bit less often now. I find ways to distract myself long enough to (temporarily) keep said compulsions at bay and combat the mental exhaustion that comes with having to endure one's own intrusive thoughts before battling the ensuing compulsions.

But it's like, just when I think I've gotten to grips handling *one* compulsion, *another* crops up, as if seeing the oppprtunity to fuck with my brain of crossed wires and resume the status quo.

Of course, OCD is a problem that'll never go away for me, and many of us. You just learn to deal with it better or in your own way. But, outside of the CBT sessions I used to do and some of the techniques I irregularly picked up from it, I eventually fail and my brain's vices catch up to me anyway. ### Yes that's the problem, the ""resetting* is circumstancial is not targeting the deeper issue going on. As some of the other replies you've gotten from other subreddits, it's a distraction, a coping mechanism to run away from the discomfort, postponing the real change you're seeking.

There's no perfect moment, resetting is not going to fix it as you've been told, it's a temporary feeling ignoring the deeper issue, which I think is relying too much of emotions to feel right, when you need the discomfort to grow and overcome this.

You feel controlled because the emotions you're experiencing are leading you more to determine how you feel, instead of you deciding how to feel. 

We have to lead with feelings we choose to have greater control over our emotional states. That's what confidence is, knowing you'll be okay no matter the outcome because how you feel was already decided ahead of time by you. How you feel is not tied to outcomes nor objects of dependence like resetting, that's outsourcing your power away.

The reason why resetting works sometimes is because you're taking action, and feel connected again, you are leading how you feel to influence your emotional states. The only way you can reinforce this positive direction and your sense of self is by taking action to continue to receive feedback (extrinsically from others socially or intrinsically from you) for you to lead consistently more often.

Remember, action precedes motivation, you have to feel secure and whole in mind and body to extrovert in these beneficial activities you desire to achieve. Motivation is momentum, you only get it after you've taken action; so if you ever feel motivated then that means you've already taken the necessary action to feel this way :) you wrote this post and got feedback to influence your emotional state, now keep it going! You got this! ### Trying my best ### Somewhat.
A good routine (with adjustments for mental health episodes) has really helped. ### What have you been doing to get over it? ### Instead of resetting I'm now trying to follow Atomic Habits ### ",88,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tf9yld/does_anyone_have_the_obsession_of_restarting/

Then I spent a lot of time deciding which bottle to give my friend and which one to take for myself based on their appearance, numbers on them and how they ‚Äúfelt in my hand‚Äù. In the end of the day, deciding for too long always makes you feel like any choice you make is the wrong one. I finally made my decision and then prepared some rituals.

I felt like I had to think it and see if it happens but simultaneously I was terrified of the outcome. One of the worse ones was i panicked when outside because I'd get it about lightning. I'd be scared that I'd think these things about being struck by lightning so I'd be anxious that since I said it in my head it's going to happen. I was convinced I could be struck by lightning any second (after thinking the thoughts) and I'd die. I don't even know why it hooked onto lightning out of everything, seriously, but it did.

Same thing with the moon. I'd stare at it and be scared that if I said those things in my head it would start coming closer and end the world. Sometimes I'd literally trick myself into believing it was getting bigger in the sky, as if coming closer. ### i can't start the fucking day if i don't read, workout and shit. Somedays just read and shit, or workout and shit it would be a semi good start, so i don't feel guilty. Habits or ocd rituals?

tfxr86,"I‚Äôm trying to overcome my contamination OCD. I could use some advice here I'm a guy. I'll soon turn 37. I'm a Christian. I was raised Christian. I went to church and to a Christian school. I‚Äôve been taught my whole life that masturbation is wrong. This probably contributed to my neuroticism over masturbation. I‚Äôm trying to overcome this OCD, but I‚Äôm having a hard time, as I‚Äôll try to explain below. I‚Äôll have to be graphic here, I‚Äôm sorry.

I have contamination OCD about my semen. It has completely ruined my life. It has severely affected my hobbies, my finances, my relationships, everything. I can‚Äôt stop regarding my semen as filthy. If I ejaculate in front of my latpop, I have to clean everything down: laptop, USB keyboard, mouse, mousepad, power cable, desk, chair. I have ruined all sorts of things with water and cleaning products. My electronics have a sad, dull look to them. The TV remote, the bedside digital clock, the laptop. They have lost their luster because of all the water and soap. I can‚Äôt have a pretty bedroom like other people. Everything is always a mess and I see all sorts of ruined objects.

I get weird synchronicities when I try to overcome my neurosis. I once came into the toilet and the next day a guy on a forum I lurked made a gif where the devil‚Äôs face alternates with a toilet and a tongue in a slurping movement is laid over the pictures. A while ago I was wanking into a sock and then my young nephew starts saying I‚Äôm ‚Äúgross‚Äù and he outright says to me ‚ÄúYou have a stinky sock‚Äù. He never saw my wank sock. How did he know? All sorts of strange coincidences like that begin to happen.

I‚Äôm so tired of my OCD. I just want to be normal like everyone else. Most people masturbate and they don‚Äôt go into cleaning frenzies every time they do. I know porn isn‚Äôt good for you but I‚Äôve seen my share of it and in amateur videos the couples don‚Äôt seem to regard semen as filthy. Couples will have sex on the couch. Women won‚Äôt even remove their wristwatches or necklaces as they‚Äôre masturbating their male partners to completion. People don‚Äôt care about semen. They seem to regard it as something neutral, almost like sweat, snot, tears, rainwater.

I‚Äôve deliberatedly smudged some of my semen on my things, on my laptop, joysticks, books, sneakers, in order to overcome this OCD. It kind of works but eventually I succumb to cleaning again. And when I try to do this kind of exposure therapy it‚Äôs like some weird lewdness overtakes me and I can‚Äôt talk to other men without coming across as gay. I‚Äôm not gay and I hate the thought of it, but the more cummy my surroudings become, the more this weird gayness seems to overtake me.

Alright, let's get real. I think I may have been sexually absused. And I‚Äôm pretty sure OCD is caused by evil spirits. In a way this is good thing. It means the OCD is nonsense. It's not real. But I‚Äôm in a difficult situation. Because in order to overcome this contamination OCD, I would have to masturbate in spots I consider ‚Äúclean‚Äù in order to deliberately ‚Äúcontaminate‚Äù them and then force myself to overcome my neurosis. But that‚Äôs a sin. Masturbation is a sin. So I have to sin in order to do the ERP.

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm exhausted and pissed off. I want to jack off and smudge some semen on everything and be done with it. Never clean anything down again. I want to put this foible to death.

Edit: For now I'll simply try not to masturbate. I recently managed to do NoFap for over a month. But deep down I just wish I could fap without feeling so guilty. And without triggering all sorts of spooky synchronicities. I didn't even mention the worst ones. What do I even do with these synchronicities? Are they signs from God, provocations from the devil, or simply some phenomenon triggered by masturbation?",3,2022-03-16 20:44:29-04:00,"I don‚Äôt have a solution for to suggest to you but I regard all bodily fluids except sweat and blood as filthy and I jerk off in bed so I treat my bed like a different world that may not bleed into the world of everything else so I have to take a shower before interacting with anything else in the house after being in bed. Know all about ruining devices too. Wish I had an answer for us all but at least you have a reply now. ### Thanks man, I appreciate the sympathy.

I think I have a way of presenting my issues in a way that seems insoluble, in a way where every possible solution has already been cornered. A form of self-sabotage. If someone suggests ERP, I'll bring up the synchronicities, and what do you advise someone experiencing synchronicities?

One obsession during the existential OCD is `why me`: how come other folks don't need to realize these or easily dismiss these thoughts. This triggers a sense of being a victim, anxiety, and more reassurance.

I‚Äôve been scared to admit this because I feel like I‚Äôm not normal and it‚Äôs put me in this sort of crisis with my identity. I pretty much have OCD regarding most things in life, especially health and relationships. But the past 2 months, my intrusive thoughts and feelings have been feeling like I‚Äôm a boy or questioning my gender and sexuality. I have certain triggers as well, I stay away from wearing certain clothes that make me feel less feminine or the weird one is if my voice sounds too deep, I get those weird feelings. I read something saying if you are trans, homosexual, bisexual- you just know and I‚Äôve been ever felt any of that before. 
This has really rocked my life. I know it‚Äôs not truly how I feel as there are times of the day where I feel completely fine then I start checking or I find something else to obsess about and these feelings don‚Äôt happen anymore. OCD is fucking cruel and a true manipulator, the fact that it tricks you into thinking these thoughts are valid and real- I can‚Äôt tell what‚Äôs true and what‚Äôs not. I feel like I‚Äôve been betrayed by my own mind and I‚Äôm ruining my own life. Honestly, I have really bad depression given all of this. 
My mind goes from one extreme to the next constantly. I‚Äôm planning to take my anti anxiety/depressants very soon because I‚Äôm reaching my breaking point. I just want to feel like myself again and beat this.

tfnin2,"Internet friends are invited again. Hello. I am from Japan.
I have OCD and mild, but intellectual disability. I also have problems with sleep.
Especially OCD is really hard for me.
I cry inside every day. I have been depressed lately and even if I want to do something, I can't do it after all. I can't see my friends and people I want to see. This is because my sleep is irregular and I don't know what time I will go to bed or wake up, so I can't make appointments to meet in advance.
I have given up a lot, but I really want to live. So I would like to talk to people with OCD. I think that people with the same illness would probably understand the pain of my OCD.
My hobbies are watching videos and listening to music.

Thank you for reading this far. I really appreciate it.
If it's okay with me, let's chat, make small talk, and talk about OCD.",3,2022-03-16 13:35:52-04:00,"What kind of videos do you like to watch? I know when my OCD gets really bad I watch a lot of nature videos about aquariums and ponds and gardening. Also what kind of music do you like to listen to? (Not to bombard you with questions, here, haha.) I love music a lot too. Music and nature are probably the two things that have helped me the most with my mental health. :)

I have bipolar and OCD (among other things) and so I've had years of very irregular sleep - I'd go 5-7 days no sleep, then crash and be really debilitated. It definitely can make it difficult to lead a 'normal' life because so much of life wants you to keep to a fixed schedule. I am doing better than I used to be thanks to medication and therapy, but this time last year I was *hopeless.*

Feel free to talk with me if you want to. If not, no pressure. :) Yeah, I've been in a similar place to where you're at and I definitely hope that talking to other people with OCD brings you a comfort. It's brought me a lot of comfort in my life - before I thought I was all alone going through this stuff but it's amazing to see how many of us are out there dealing with it, and trying to make our lives as pleasant as they can be. I'm always happy to talk to people about it now because I feel like it's helped me, so I'm happy to help other people too. :) ### I'm not diagnosed (got a referral though!) but I'd be happy to chat if you'd like ### hii , i just saw your post now, i struggle a lot with sleep too & well my ocd , yeah she's an absolute sweetheart in my life ( sarcasm ) it's really taken over my entire life.

tfin7q,"Feeling Personally Responsible for Florida‚Äôs Don‚Äôt Say Gay Bill Because I Love a Star Wars This title sounds batshit, but bear with me. I‚Äôm a Star Wars super fan. I write fanfiction, draw fanart, chat with people about it online, and cosplay. I‚Äôm even going to SWCA and working on a Tech cosplay to wear while I‚Äôm there. If this interest sounds intense, then I can assure you that it is. In addition to having OCD, I am autistic and Star Wars is my hyperfixation (I hate the term special interest, but that‚Äôs a synonym). Star Wars has, overall, been a positive force in my life and a fun hobby, but it‚Äôs owned by Disney and I‚Äôm queer.

There‚Äôs been a wave of anti-LGBTQ legislation this year, and it‚Äôs terrifying to think that a bunch of elderly evangelical assholes in suits want to criminalize me for existing. Hearing that Disney funded the Don‚Äôt Say Gay bill in Florida enraged me. They almost certainly used my money to help pass this awful bill and may very well support more like it.  I feel personally responsible for hurting other queer people because I love Star Wars, but I‚Äôm too selfish to give my passion and hobby up, so I feel like an awful person and a hypocrite. I know, on an intellectual level, that me never even looking at Star Wars again would have zero impact on what The Mouse does with its money, but my brain is stuck in a loop of ‚Äúwhat-ifs‚Äù that I can‚Äôt shake.

Anyone else dealing with something similar?",9,2022-03-16 10:15:18-04:00,"I mean the logic chain here is a hell of a lot more rational than some of the shit that I come up with, e.g. I caused the pandemic because I didn't kiss my dog 20 times ### I feel people should be able to sue the big corporation because it uses funding from them to directly attack phisicaly or mentally it's own public based on bias. So, I don't see it as is your fault but the corporation fault. Still get why are you feeling like that, hope you manage to see is not your fault but Disney being the big hypocrite. ### I completely agree with you about the don‚Äôt say gay bill and I think it‚Äôs awful plus I think it‚Äôs terrible that Disney has supported it. I‚Äôm not a therapist so I‚Äôll tell you what would go through my mind. I really don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd do in your shoes. Part of me would say have a balance and do what I love (Star Wars) and don‚Äôt let Disney‚Äôs choices take that away from me. I could tell my fans my opinions about disney and educate them about the don‚Äôt say gay bill and why it‚Äôs bad. On the other hand I‚Äôve seen how people are protesting disney and it‚Äôs not good that disney supported the bill so maybe I‚Äôd stop doing things related to disney. That‚Äôs a hard decision if I was in your shoes. I believe in you and I‚Äôm sorry this is happening in our country ### I am an older adult with ASD chemistry was my big thing. I still binge a lot of videos about it, but not so committed to doing it anymore. Have you read Turtles All The Way Down? I think you might get inspiration from her friend who writes Star Wars fan fiction. Have you considered directing your art at attacking a thinly veiled stand-in for Disney? Not directly helping with your initial question, but maybe a helpful outlet. ### Where in the bill specifically does say the word ls don‚Äôt say Gay? ### The horrible thing is that I don‚Äôt think I can stop doing Star Wars stuff. The fandom has been one of the things keeping me going even though I‚Äôm an antisocial weirdo and my life kind of sucks. I‚Äôm a terrible person. ### I‚Äôm not here to debate the wording of the bill. The meat and potatoes of this post is that I am not fond of the bill in question and that Disney‚Äôs involvement is triggering my OCD, followed by a question for other community members about their own OCD struggles where their personal morals feel compromised. If you are looking to ‚Äútrigger the libs‚Äù or whatever, this isn‚Äôt the place. This is a support subreddit for people with a specific mental illness, don‚Äôt derail. ### You‚Äôre really not a terrible person, like at all. It‚Äôs unfortunate that companies come out and donate to campaigns in the first place as it puts the general public in this situation where you feel you‚Äôre funding something terrible. You aren‚Äôt. Disney made that decision and it‚Äôs their bed to make with it. Nothing wrong with still liking something just because some exec somewhere decided to support a politician or a cause. I‚Äôm gay myself, and I‚Äôm still a Star Wars fan. Shit, I‚Äôm ngl, I still get Chick Fil A once in awhile. Do I agree with the terrible stuff their CEO supports? Of course not. But I can‚Äôt help but like their food if I‚Äôm in the mood for it.

At the end of the day, pretty much every big major company probably has someone in it that supports a terrible cause or ruling or ideology. That‚Äôs that individual‚Äôs fault, and it doesn‚Äôt mean by using their products or being a fan of movies or shows produced by them makes you agree with them. Think of all the other people you‚Äôre helping by being a fan. Actors, writers, producers, artists, designers, tech ppl, all of whom probably disagree with the bill as much as we do. Doesn‚Äôt excuse the Rise of Skywalker‚Äôs writing, but that‚Äôs another story entirely ;)

But seriously, you are absolutely not a terrible person. OCD often makes us feel that way, but it‚Äôs just OCD. That‚Äôs awesome that you‚Äôre such a fan of it, and you absolutely should continue to be because you‚Äôre supporting all of the good people involved as well. ### Please don‚Äôt say you‚Äôre a terrible person, I can tell from your post that you want to do what‚Äôs right. I think you should definitely talk to your therapist about this. I believe in you! ### ",8,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tfin7q/feeling_personally_responsible_for_floridas_dont/

 so long story short, i‚Äôve struggled with OCD, anxiety and depression since 13 (i‚Äôm now 25) and the lack of support has been so tiring. recently i‚Äôve been trying lots of different medication (i‚Äôve tried just about everything under the sun over the course of the past 12 years) and have been really really struggling for a while now. in about october last year, my doctor sent away a referral to the anxiety disorders unit here who i have seen before but yeaaars ago and they were terrible but apparently they‚Äôve gotten better so thought i‚Äôd try again. 

anyway, it took until FEB this year where I myself had to follow up and they said they hadn‚Äôt gotten enough information for a referral which was bull. by jan/feb i‚Äôm suicidal, for reference. things are bad.

my doc stresses how urgent and bad my situation is, and today I get a letter from the unit saying something vague like ‚Äúwe won‚Äôt be seeing you‚Äù and just lists the numbers of a few help lines. like what???? am I not sick enough? this is ridiculous. i‚Äôm sick of the way i can‚Äôt get help here, or when you do it‚Äôs piss poor or takes forever. the mental health system in this country is terrible.

tft779,"Musical Tinnitus, Musical Ear Syndrome (MES), and Schiz-OCD? Hello!

I've had obsessions related to health for over a year now relating to all sorts of diseases (neurological, gastro, vision, hearing, etc.) especially with physical symptom manifestations. All of these diagnoses turned out to be false with medical testing so I thought I was finally over the hump...until I started dealing with severe schiz-OCD since last October. This obsession finally prompted me to get a diagnosis from a professional who said I had OCD and we started ERP, which had been going great for most of November-January. 

For a while, I stopped spending hours checking for sounds and researching about psychosis online and was approaching something close to normal life. Then about a month ago, I started worrying again about hearing music that wasn't there. I got back to checking the source of every sound I heard and the checking never resulted in fining anything...until about two weeks ago when I started feeling like I actually was hearing really faint, high pitched melodies when it was really quiet. I can't tell if I'm just projecting my anxiety/hyperawareness onto random sounds to create melodies, whether this is a form of musical tinnitus/musical ear syndrome (I have severe tinnitus), or I am actually starting to hallucinate and am in a state of psychosis? It's crippling me at this point and preventing me from focusing on work or being able to socialize with friends. I'm hoping this is just stress induced from work and some side projects I'm taking on right now.  

I am so scared to tell my therapist about this at my appointment in a few weeks because I'm terrified she might have to retract my OCD diagnosis and refer me to another professional who will say I am in psychosis.

If you're noticing that your OCD is getting worse around your menstrual cycle, you've probably got PMDD.

PMDD is something recently as of 2013 that was officially entered into the DMS-5.

I've been researching the topic of OCD and PMDD because I have both. It's not a topic that has a lot of info, but there are medical journals and trial data. 


Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a severe form of premenstrual syndrome (PMS). PMDD can cause depression, anxiety, and other physical and mental health symptoms during the two weeks leading up to your period. These symptoms can be so extreme that they get in the way of your daily life, like work, school, or your relationships. PMDD symptoms usually go away once your period actually starts in your cycle, or a day or two after.

Female hormones affect symptom severity in obsessive-compulsive disorder
Nienke C C Vulink 1, Damiaan Denys, L√©onie Bus, Herman G M Westenberg
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16528139/

‚ÄúThere is circumstantial evidence that reproductive events can influence symptom severity of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). We sent self-report questionnaires to 350 female outpatients with OCD to examine the relationship between the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, menopause, hormonal contraceptives, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and symptom severity of OCD. Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale scores were used at three serial time points during the menstrual cycle to assess symptom severity. One hundred and one out of 350 questionnaires (29%) were returned and completed. Forty-nine patients reported an exacerbation of OCD symptoms during the premenstrual period, nine during the menopause and 17 patients during pregnancy, whereas 11 patients mentioned improvement of OCD symptoms during pregnancy. Premenstrual dysphoric disorder could only partly explain a premenstrual exacerbation of OCD symptoms. Exacerbation of OCD could be related to reproductive events in a considerable number of patients, especially the premenstrum. Because reproductive cycle events influence the symptom severity of OCD, the menstrual cycle should be taken into account when assessing the severity of OCD symptoms during pharmacological studies.‚Äù

What is premenstrual dysphoric disorder?
What are the common misconceptions about PMDD?
What about the misdiagnosis? How many go undiagnosed altogether?
How can someone spot each of the 11 symptoms:
Mood changes
Irritability, anger, or an uptick in interpersonal conflicts
Feelings of depression, hopelessness, or having self-deprecating thoughts
Anxiety or tension
Lack of interest in people and activities you usually enjoy
Difficulty concentrating
Fatigue or lack of energy
Appetite changes or specific food cravings
Excessive sleepiness or insomnia
Feeling overwhelmed or out of control
Physical symptoms like breast soreness or swelling, joint or muscle pain, or feeling bloated
How can someone spot the signs that these are PMDD and not something else?

What is Premenstrual Dysphoria? - Tracey Marks, MD. Psychiatrist. 

People with PMDD are sensitive to the drop in progesterone. It's progesterone that's turned into allopregnanolone. Allopregnanolone binds to GABA-A receptors. The GABA-A receptors are the same receptors that alcohol, benzos and xanax bind to. So Allopregnanolone has the effect of decreasing anxiety and depression. For women who are sensitive to the drop in progesterone, what they can experience can be similar to withdrawing from Xanax or alcohol.

Main treatment for PMDD is through SSRIs. It takes about 4-6 weeks to determine effectiveness. 
SSRIs also accelerate the conversion of progesterone to allopregnanolone. This effect works faster than the SSRIs have when they increase serotonin to treat depression.

The FDA has approved YAZ birth control or a medication called Leuprolide, which is basically a chemically induced menopause.

What to look for and how to treat patients who have PMDD, MDD, and other disorders mixed in: https://youtu.be/2rG4DJLG_uA?t=836 ### Same! I‚Äôve tried skipping periods with BC, but that just makes it worse. Best we can hope for is the sweet release of menopause. ### Yup it‚Äôs the hormones from ovulation to the time period starts. It lasts two weeks. It happens to me as well... But I recommend you try omega 3 fish oil pills and magnesium. Supposedly the fish pills help balance hormones. I noticed that they helped regulate my cycle and overall mood. And magnesium has a calming effect. This combo has helped me tremendously bc the last few months were rough and after taking these consistently for a month and a half I‚Äôve noticed a huge improvement in my mood and anxiety levels. I still deal with the OCD but I‚Äôm much more calm. Obv there‚Äôs other life factors which have helped me but it wouldn‚Äôt hurt to look into these if they can help you ! ### Same here. Now that I've had a hysterectomy, I'm watching to see how lower estrogen levels affect my OCD. So far it's feeling better overall. At least it feels more manageable. ### I notice that my symptoms get worse n certain ways during and after my periods. It's almost literal torture sometimes with how intense obsessions can get. ### Yep! I‚Äôm also seeing a hormone specialist for my PMDD, and this is one of the things we‚Äôre hoping to figure out. She thinks it‚Äôs related to progesterone? 

I found a study that said they found OCD/anxiety spiked for pregnant women, and they think it‚Äôs due to the dramatic increase in progesterone‚Ä¶and progesterone spikes during the 2 weeks before your period.

Here‚Äôs the article I read:

https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/articles/new-research-into-obsessive-compulsive-disorder-during-pregnancy ### Same thing happens to me. ### Same! It gets scarily bad during that week ### I WAS JUST BEMOANING THIS YESTERDAY. It's so reeeeal ### Absolutely. It‚Äôs very real. ### Same issue. It‚Äôs common to flare during hormonal fluctuations, like just before the period and during ovulation. Mine gets so bad I almost can‚Äôt manage it - I feel like I go so well with all my ERP then the week before my period I always forget (I have ADHD too). Whenever I feel myself getting bad, I check my cycle app and behold, usually 4 or so days until my period. My therapist recommended ramping up the self care around this time and going over my ERP more aggressively the week prior, then during this time using all my tools and implement them. I can‚Äôt say SSRI‚Äôs have ‚Äòcured‚Äô the flares because it‚Äôs cyclic and hormonal; it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs very hard to change or manage besides using our toolkit of knowledge, mindfulness and self care around this time. I‚Äôve known those who are pregnant and post pregnancy have similar issues, as well as menopause. ### Yup, happens to me too. As if the actual period part wasnt bad enough now i have to deal with worsened OCD symptoms. ### I‚Äôm starting to notice this as well for myself.

tfnvc3,"Is it normal to feel that my OCD has been getting more stressful since I restarted therapy? I (21F) had OCD all my life, at least since I remember. When I was a child, I thought the way I did things and the way I thought were the ""normal"" behaviour and only about the age of 12-14 did I start to realize that something was wrong. It was also about this time that my OCD compulsions started to have a clear impact on my daily basis.

Basically, my OCD has very little to do with cleaning. It's more about occupying every single second of my day with something that I need to do. I'm a worker-student, which means I have a pretty busy week schedule. I don't have blank days, there's always something to do. I also have to study and read a lot, as I'm taking a Literature degree. 

The thing is: for the most part, my OCD helps me keeping track of everything I need to get done. Because I've had it for so many years, I've developed some really (and I mean REALLY) complex systems to study, to tidy up my room, to do house chores, to listen to music, to watch movies/tv shows, to go to bed, etc. Everything is very well planned and I do it so religiously that it feels like there's really zero space for me to just exist. 

I've had better and worse phases and at about 14 I started therapy to try to avoid intrusive thoughts and to help me cope with exhaustion. However, I was only followed closely for about 6 months because my therapist wasn't great and I couldn't bond with him.

Now, 7 years later, I decided it was time to seek for help again because I never rest from my obsessions and I've been feeling very depressive because of them. I feel like they're draining me and I'm getting tired of feeling I'm wasting my whole life.

So, here I am, two months after restarting it. My new therapist has given me cool tools to help me sleep better and new strategems to avoid intrusive thoughts. But I think I've been getting worse...

I turned to weed again (I used to smoke weed when I was 18-19, I smoked pretty much everyday because it relieved me of my compulsions) and, when I'm high, I completely ignore my rituals and just rest, lay in bed, watch tv, eat, etc. But when I'm sober again I start panincking because of everything I left undone. That causes me to become depressive again, with a million intrusive thougths coming to my head at the same time. That, consequently, makes me smoke again. And the cycle repeats.

I'm becoming kind of desperate, I'm truly tired of my compulsions, obsessions and of not having time to myself. Before therapy, my OCD was annoying me but I was happy, normal and actually very active in life. I don't think it's necessarily my therapist's fault, but maybe because of the fact that I'm now very very aware of my compulsions, they are bothering me more (?). 

I really don't know what to think. Is this normal? I also have a lot of difficulty at really expressing and explaining to my therapist how my OCD works because it's so complex I feel like I would waste a good 4-5 sessions without interruption to explain everything... 

Any tips on how to improve my explanations?

tft02i,"Good thing or bad thing - counts as checking/reassurance-seeking behavior or an opportunity to use response prevention? Hello guys,

One of my major fears is randomly testing positive for an STD. I had a test done right when I first started dating my fiance (he said he had never had one done so I wanted to get one done just in case).  I talked to my therapist about fears of false negatives and she told me to NOT get another test done as that would be ""checking behavior"" and if the risk of false negatives was that significant the standard procedure would be to get multiple tests. That was 5 years ago and since we're monogamous I haven't had another test done. Well today I went to a new gynecologist and she suggested having an STD test because it's better to be safe than sorry. I was too shy to say no so I just agreed to it.

I'm kinda kicking myself now. Does this count as ""checking behavior""/seeking reassurance? Or is it an opportunity to try to not respond to a trigger (getting an STD test) by seeking reassurance from friends and family? I'm not sure if I did the right thing by accepting the test.

tfh8od,"OCD and ruminating from a memory. I seriously feel like the worse person in the world. This memory has probably affected my false memory OCD as I can‚Äôt be certain as to how I felt all those years ago, but I‚Äôm trying to tell it as clearly as I can now.
So, a few years ago a week after my 18th birthday, I met a boy I was speaking to at the time and he invited me to go to a concert with him. I did, and it was a while away from both of our houses so he stayed in a hotel with all of his friends and invited me to stay in it with him. I accepted, although I fully didn‚Äôt know if I felt comfortable to now looking back on it, but that could just be how I feel now as an adult. We basically were sharing a room with his 16 year old friend, (the boy I was seeing was 18). I can‚Äôt remember if I knew if we were sharing the room with his friend, but now I feel super uncomfortable thinking about it and would like to think I felt the same back then. Basically, we hit it off in the room, under the covers, I was clothed, but his 16 year old friend was in the room at the other side in his own bed sleeping. I was fresh out of a long term relationship I‚Äôd been in since I was 16, and felt so naive and vulnerable and just let this guy do whatever with me, even though I wasn‚Äôt into it and I didn‚Äôt like the guy in that way. But what I‚Äôm more concerned about now, and feel absolutely rotten about, is the fact this his 16 year old friend was in the room. I feel like a pedophile if that makes any sense. I would never ever ever do anything to endanger/inappropriate in front of a minor or anything of the sorts, so thinking back on the memory now I feel sick to my stomach that I engaged in that behaviour, although I wasn‚Äôt completely into it and genuinely just wanted to sleep most of the time as I was so tired - it‚Äôs not an excuse as I still engaged in the it and let him do what he wanted. What concerns me besides that, is did the thought of his friend being in the room ever occur to me? Because now, I would never ever do anything of the sort with anyone in the vicinity especially a minor!! I am disgusted with myself. I don‚Äôt even know if that thought crossed my mind (which scares me so much, because it‚Äôs all I can think about now!) that we were sharing the room and that it was a problem, because we were covered with duvets etc and I was still practically clothed. But still, engaging in behaviour like that with a 16 year old trying to sleep in the room, I feel so beyond sick and disgusted. It was never ever out of anything other than ignorance and being naive, but still, i feel absolutely horrible now and I feel like the worst person in the world that I ever engaged in that behaviour in an environment like that because that is so not me and of course it stands against everything I believe in. I feel like the worst person in the world, my anxiety and OCD won‚Äôt let me forget about this event and it keeps replaying in my head.

It‚Äôs not going to help you. You need to accept uncertainty, label this as ocd, tolerate the anxiety, and do something else. 

If you can see a therapist, that would be good. 

Listen, ocd is a liar. Your brain malfunctions. And in those episodes you cannot trust your judgement. You get lost in your thoughts. You need to get treatment and trust the process and your therapist. In this case, the process is probably learning to be mindfully aware of intrusive thoughts when they come, labeling them as ocd, accepting uncertainty (maybe that was wrong, I can‚Äôt be certain and I‚Äôm not going to figure it out), choose not to consider the details, tolerate the anxiety and guilt (remind yourself: I don‚Äôt like these feelings, but they are the feelings of my mind healing), and find something meaningful to do. 

I‚Äôm sorry this is so hard. ### Thank you, I really appreciate your advice. I am currently trying to find a therapist who specialises in OCD, I feel that would most hopefully help. It‚Äôs just so hard in the meantime when not receiving that specific support, it‚Äôs so much more difficult to deal with OCD and intrusive thoughts. ### Until then, try reading Brain Lock or Stoping The Noise in Your Head. 

The core treatment is always going to be resisting the compulsions (mental reviewing). And when you do that your guilt will increase. And you‚Äôll say to yourself, what if I‚Äôm just using ocd to excuse my evil actions? And, Ignore these thoughts makes me an even more wicked person! When those thoughts come, label them as ocd (we basically all get those very same thoughts), and do something else. Allow the guilt to be there. Say, okay guilt. You can hang out if you want. But I‚Äôm not going to pay attention to you. 

And when you think, but what if it‚Äôs not ocd and I tricked someone on the internet into reassuring me, label that as ocd too! And say to yourself, yes, maybe I don‚Äôt have ocd.

Thank you in advance",9,2022-03-16 12:08:12-04:00,"I suppose, in theory, this might be helpful if you were to ""face your fears"" in a lucid dream much like how ERP works. I imagine, however, that if your anxiety were to ratchet up you'd just awaken like you were having a nightmare. On the other hand, being that you know it's a dream maybe you wouldn't experience anxiety and in that case maybe it's not helpful at all. 

This is an interesting idea to consider. It's no wonder there is no information about it available, this would be an extremely difficult thing to test at research-scale. ### No I don‚Äôt think so. A lucid dream is one where you‚Äôre aware you are dreaming so if you know it‚Äôs not real, are you really facing the fear? It‚Äôs like an imaginal exercise but you can do those awake. Plus I bet you‚Äôre more likely to do compulsions in a lucid dream because not all the higher level cognitive parts of your brain are on. ### It wouldn't be good to do ERP because you'd just wake up. You have to be very calm when lucid dreaming or else you'll just wake up so ### Been wondering tho what happens once you master it, and if it's worth reaching that milestone cuz I always wanted to lucid dream ### What if it isn't ERP is what I wonder ### Lucid dreaming is fun in and of itself. I used to do a lot of lucid dreaming before I realized I actually preferred my regular dreams because it was more immersive and fun. Now I tend to do dream checks during nightmares and then change the narrative but otherwise enjoy regular dreams. ### Even if it isn't EPR though if it's gonna cause any anxiety at all you'll probably wake up. And even if you aren't going to get anxious, lucid dreaming (if you don't do it naturally) is very very tough and challenging. Hey though, I always encourage trying lucid dreaming so go for it. ### did it help you to relax the side effects of OCD in any shape or form? ### No ### ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tfljio/ocd_and_lucid_dreaming/
tfdg1r,"I convinced myself I had done something awful TW: Rape

I had a bad trip on an edible at a friend‚Äôs place and a memory came back from five years prior. I read a Reddit post that day from someone telling a story of their rapist and the times/details very loosely lined up with my memory. The memory is: I was blackout drunk at a New Years party making out with a girl in a bathtub. I know 100% that‚Äôs all that it was because I double checked with people there during the recovery phase of this whole ordeal. I started having intrusive thoughts, though. It started with ‚Äúhang on a second was that Reddit post made by her? Have I done something terrible I didn‚Äôt even realize?‚Äù. This started a panic and I began pacing in the bathroom like a broken Sim. At this point I retreated fully into my head, slowly building up the story of how awful I am, preparing for everyone to hate me and go to jail. On the Uber home it took all of my will not to pull the car door handle and roll out.

The morning after I started googling the laws around rape in my country. I started digging deep into five years of Facebook posts and Instagram posts to see if this story made any sense or not. I kept getting evidence that I did nothing wrong, but each piece of evidence just further convinced me I needed to look harder. I ended up on a loop that my nervous system has memories locked in and it‚Äôs only a matter of time before they reveal themselves to me and I am confirmed evil.

The stress also started a year long struggle with acid reflux.

I‚Äôm in a better headspace now. This event is what made me start therapy. While this was happening I didn‚Äôt know it was OCD. I thought I was just crazy and awful. I realize now I had obsessed about things in the past like HOCD.

Anyways, just wanted to share. This community makes me feel less insane so hopefully this helps someone too.",3,2022-03-16 05:14:15-04:00,"Glad you're doing better, I'm still looking for professional help but learning about OCD has helped a lot, while I'm still not sure if I have actually done something wrong I can at the very least say my thought patterns about things match up a lot with this disorder ### I‚Äôm going through something similar. I was at a pool club in FT Lauderdale 2 days ago and I got really drunk along with most people there. So I don‚Äôt remember much but what I do remember is that I went to the bathroom and then went back to the pool area. Around 30 minutes- an hour later, my friend and I left the pool area to go home. As we walked past the bathroom, however, a wave of panic flew over me for a seemingly unexplained reason. ‚ÄúDid something horrible happen while I was in the bathroom? Did I do something unforgivable to someone? I can‚Äôt remember every last detail so how do I know 100% if I didn‚Äôt!!!!‚Äù I began digging around what little I could remember about going to the bathroom. I remembered accidentally walking into the ladies room at some point because it was before the mens in the hall way. ‚ÄúDid I do something horrible while I was in there that I forgot because I was too drunk?‚Äù I remembered locking a stall for certain while in the bathroom. ‚Äúcould I have shoved someone in a stall before doing something horrible and forgetting about it?‚Äù I remembered seeing someone crying at some point in the trip, ‚Äúwas it while I was in the bathroom after I had done something terrible?‚Äù Panicking, I asked a friend of mine how long I was in the bathroom and that if he heard of any guy going into the women‚Äôs bathroom. He told me he hadn‚Äôt heard of any such thing, however, that it was impossible for anyone to do so for long as there were security stationed in all the bathrooms. It helped for about 2 seconds, before thoughts of me bribing a security guard or intimidating him into leaving flooded my head. The moral of the story is there is never anything any of us will be able to tell ourselves or reveal to ourselves that will put our minds at ease. For people like us, to say I could have = I probably did, no matter the kind of person you are or any sort of evidence to the contrary. We can‚Äôt move on or tell ourselves it‚Äôs all just OCD because then we would not only be monsters, but we would be off the hook for being monsters, which makes it worse. There‚Äôs nothing I could give you to reassure you that you‚Äôre not what your OCD tells you you are. But I can say that you are not alone. And the fact that you are bothered by it should be evident that you wouldn‚Äôt be likely to just shrug it off at the time until you remember it out of nowhere. ### If you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please do not hesitate to talk to someone.

I have had similar days the past few weeks and what generally happens to me after a lot of extremely high anxiety is it's like something shuts off. Almost like my body runs out of whatever chemical (adrenaline?) is being produced and I actually calm down. It may take several hours but it will pass.  I know it's hell when you are in them but it always passes.

If you can get an appointment anywhere for a doctor, tell them you're having panic attacks and I think they will prescribe you something until you can see your psych.

tey1h3,"tired of fighting my OCD (Vent post) 

It's like a game of wack-a-mole. I overcome one obsession and then the next theme pops up. It takes so much strength to not perform my compulsions 

I'm currently battling contamination OCD and keep throwing out ""contaminated"" food and beverages, which is starting to become expensive. However, I don't really have it in me anymore to fight it. I'm so done. Besides, I'd rather my OCD stay on this theme than go back to the whole ""You're an immoral person"" thing.

I guess the point of this is that OCD sucks, and I'm so tired of it, and I feel like giving up on fighting it. Maybe I'll have more energy in the future, but the past few months have just been too exhausting.",5,2022-03-15 15:37:41-04:00,"Hang in there, I totally know what you mean about not wanting to fight a theme because it's less exhausting than the immorality theme. Sometimes I'm thankful for what I'm obsessing over in some weird fucked up way, because it's not as soul crushing as other stuff.

tenqdf,"What is the first OCD symptom you can remember? I‚Äôll go first! 

I grew up Christian and when I was in elementary school I would say the same exact prayer every night word for word. My prayer was basically asking God to keep the people that I cared about ‚Äúsafe and healthy and happy and alive‚Äù and I would mention the specific people in order of who I loved and cared about the most to the least. And then I would sing a bible song that I learned after the prayer every night as a sort of confirmation that the prayer went through and everything would be good. 

Back then I literally didn‚Äôt think anything of it but now that I know I have OCD it‚Äôs interesting to think of all the things I did as a child that I saw as normal and were obviously just early signs",339,2022-03-15 08:22:20-04:00,"I remember making sure the fridge was ""really"" closed ### I would have the same thing wow. I had to pray for every single person I wanted alive and I would have to ask God to keep them happy healthy and safe ### From roughly ages 6-10 I would wave my hand over my sleeping baby brother‚Äôs face almost every night before bed to feel for breath and reassure myself that he was still alive, lol ### I used to imagine myself spitting into people‚Äôs mouths when they talked, so, sometimes, I didn‚Äôt want to talk.
I was terrified after I learned cracks could break your momma‚Äôs back and I realized I‚Äôd been unknowingly stepping on cracks. 
I hated other children (even in kindergarten) because they couldn‚Äôt follow rules.
I had to make straight As or my parents would die.
I didn‚Äôt eat with my hands until I was older because I didn‚Äôt like touching food. I just dove in with my mouth.
I started scratching my head in one spot when I was upset when I was probably 4.
Coloring caused me distress. ### When i was a kid, i remember constantly counting how many seconds a tv commercial lasted and according to my mom when a distressed me told her, ‚Äúthats normal everyone does it‚Äù lol ### Anytime I would type on a keyboard, I constantly spammed the shift button with my pinky finger. I felt like it needed some sort of stimulation while the other fingers were typing. ### The first memory I have was when I was like 6-7. We have visitors so my mom prepared some food. I eat one waffle and I wanted to eat another one because they were tasty. Then I have this thought that if I eat the second waffle something bad will happen because two is a bad number. So I either eat 3 waffles or I can't eat the second one. I know it sounds ridiculous.üòÑ ### I constantly said random letters like G or H when I was 6, I knew it was weird at the time but I felt like I had to say it

My parents never thought anything of it somehow ### I suddenly started to have false memories of things I supposedly did that in fact never happened (first harm, then checking, now contamination). ### Feeling a weird unevenness when I didn‚Äôt step on sidewalk cracks an even amount, or having to touch both sides of a desk at school until it felt equally touched on both sides. ### I had to confess anything bad I did or thought to my mom. ### ruminating. I found that I suddenly no longer felt like a part of my life because I spent so much time obsessing about persisting anxieties that never left my brain, always on the back burner when I was trying to live my life ### I wouldn‚Äôt look at my pet rabbit when I walked past the window. I thought by not looking at him he wouldn‚Äôt escape. I have no fucking idea where that came from.

I then moved on to touching the side of my bed nine times before sleep to stop the world from ending ### oh god..I was around 7 and it was such a multitude of things all at once, but classic stuff like touching things an even number of times, not stepping on the grates between the tiles, not letting my body touch a certain part of the furniture that had a seam in it were the big ones i can remember. 

i also had this one i do and often still do, it‚Äôs not rly a compulsion though but like this weird magical thinking confirmation thing? where like if i‚Äôm doing something where there can be several outcomes like..let‚Äôs say..if i grab a pill from a bottle and let‚Äôs say one side of the pill has numbers on it and the other side has letters, i‚Äôll tell myself if the numbers side of it lands on top when i grab it, that confirms i‚Äôll be safe from whatever i‚Äôm afraid of. I have never found out what thats called but I do it with soooo many random everyday situations like even just when typing like ‚Äòif i don‚Äôt make a typo then that means this good thing will happen‚Äô ### I have to count ceiling tiles everywhere... it's kind of exhausting. ### Tapping. Lots of tapping is a specific way at a specific time on a specific thing. ### Blinking hard until it felt ‚Äúright‚Äù and detailed prayers for loved ones so they wouldn‚Äôt die. I also had an obsession with HIV after learning about it along with pregnancy. ### I would repeat ""good night"" to my mom because i thought i didnt say it right the first time ### I have more incompleteness / not just right motivations than harm avoidance. 
The first ‚Äúquirk‚Äù I remember developing that I now recognize as a symptom was needing to take equal steps on each sidewalk block at my elementary school, if I took say 3 steps with my right foot on a tile, but could only fit 2 with my left, I would get distressingly uncomfortable and to avoid that I would do (and still do but more discreetly now) weird little stutter steps and hops because I need to keep my feet equal. ### I also obsessively prayed each night and always ended my prayers with wishing everyone would stay safe and healthy and happy and alive. ### I asked myself I was actually real ### The whole ""step on a crack you'll break your mother's back"" thing. Even though I knew it wasn't real, my brain kept telling me that if there was even a chance it was and my mom died because of it, that was too much. ### Magical thinking at 10.

I used to have to knock my feet together and do this whole elaborate hand ritual thingie or else something bad would happen to my parents.

Was very mild from 10-17. Then my OCD got severe at 18/19 ### Hyperfocussing on problems and reassurance seeking, still a PAIN in the ass. ### I‚Äôm not diagnosed but suspecting. For me, if I do have ocd it‚Äôs really violent obsessions about deaths, the first one was my father‚Äôs death from a helicopter accident. Used to go to sleep crying because it kept replaying in my head, started when I was like 8-9. ### Checking about 10 times if I had everything I needed for school ### Tourretic OCD here. As early as 5 I remember having vocal tics and mental tics (mainly reading signs/billboards/etc and repeating the phrase over and over in my head). And, having detailed fantasies about my family members dying in a car accident to ""save them"". ### I‚Äôm in my mid 50‚Äôs and have said the exact same prayer the exact same way every night of my life (that I can remember). Any deviation would have allowed harm to come to those I prayed for. I didn‚Äôt know it at the time what it was. After years of ET where I‚Äôve forced myself to allow ‚Äúrisk‚Äù to come by deviating from a process. This is the one thing I cannot bring myself to change. TOO RISKY. Even though I know that it‚Äôs not what keeps people safe. I cannot change it. A person I pray for has in fact passed away in the interim and I still pray for him to be healthy. Weird. Cause I don‚Äôt feel I can change the prayer. 

As for the first symptom that drove me to get help. It was staying in a hotel one night and feeling with 100% certainty I was going to dive off the balcony. What  I didn‚Äôt know was it was an intrusive thought. It was the scariest night of my life. Matter of fact the next day I thought I would drive my car onto a railroad track and then every other imaginable way of self harm one can think of. Literally. Now as those thoughts come and go (which suck) I have some way to contextualize them and have techniques to mitigate the stress.  

As I should make clear. I‚Äôm not an expert and don‚Äôt know much beyond my experience. But if your hurting out there. Your not alone. Ask for help. Get it. It‚Äôs doable. ### Playing the same songs over and over, months at a time, even if the songs were crap. ### Having fucked up instrusivs thoughts and images ### Intrusive harm thoughts. I was really little and they scared me. :( I also always measured spaces with my eyes, drew straight lines from corner to corner with eyes when observing architecture, usually on ceilings, and calculated how many numbers could be extracted from a 2+ digit number by multiplying, subtracting, dividing, or adding the numbers. I still do this, particularly with license plates, and if it's a number that makes me uncomfortable I'm always seized with the worry that something bad is going to happen. ### I remember holding my breath around ""contaminated"" people and things when I was about 9 ### First memory was needing to drag my feet in certain areas of a store because if I didn't my parents would die. Then it was getting intrusive thoughts when praying at night thinking ""I love satan"" and then panicking after I'd go to hell ### First memories? Trying to harm myself because I kept getting mental images of me harming Jesus.  I also used to feel like if I didn‚Äôt pick up after myself that I would die or my family would. 
I always felt that Jesus knew my thoughts and I would constantly pray for god to forgive me of my sins because I thought If I didn‚Äôt that something bad would happen. 
I would also check my pulse multiple times a day to make sure I was still alive.

Edit: this started when I was about 10. ### replaying music to my favorite part numerous times until it actually sounded good for me because then i'd get irritable if it wasnt ### Yep, praying I couldn‚Äôt be interrupted at all, even by my own brain wandering, or I‚Äôd have to start over again. Sign of the cross in an even number, not a multiple of 3 or 6, and I had to be imagining a cross while doing it for each one again, with no mind wandering. ### Feels like religion is just a gateway to aggravating ocd for me and a lot of other people. ### That's the same but that's only realising now I used to pray for every distant relative and pet I could think of in a specific order every night ### I struggle more with pure o, so I don‚Äôt have a lot of memories with compulsions. Now that I know more about OCD, I do remember being PLAGUED by vivid images of my loved ones dying, of my parents going out a date and never returning (because they would‚Äôve died). I remember having ‚Äúurges‚Äù to want to harm myself and not understanding what was wrong with me. I was probably around 9-11 when this started. I also grew up Christian! ### I remember not sitting on a chair for half an hour after someone sat on it, having to put(drop) things on top of counters ‚Äújust right‚Äù and not lettiny my bedsheet have any wrinkles ### When I was 5 I used to lay in bed crying because I couldn‚Äôt get the mental image of bugs crawling around out of my head. I would try sleeping and all I could see in my mind was bugs. It was so scary! Fast forward when I was 15, the thought popped into my head, ‚ÄúOne day my parents will die.‚Äù This is the first sticky thought I had and the one that brought in the compulsions to google non stop about life after death, and to ask my parents for reassurance about religion all of the time. Since then I‚Äôve had rOCD, somatic OCD, and right now I‚Äôm going through a horrible bout of existential OCD. ### Picturing pushing my sisters friend over and her head cracking off the ground over and over while being horrified by it ### Leaving the class or the house or any place or closing the door of the car last, if I was rushed to leave the classroom I usually go back when no one there and leave after. It just gives me this weird feeling of nervousness and excitement like i'm about to pee my pants but not really(also, kind of sexual thoughts even though I didn't know what those things were when I was like 7 or 8 years old) kind of really. ### Idk if this is ocd but I remember when I was younger being over come with fright and paranoia that I frequently got up and screamed and then would lost my memory of the event happening every time right after. I thought everyone at the school knew but no one pointed out this quirk bc I couldn‚Äôt help it. I would sit in class and monitor my actions and how other people treated me to see if this was true. ü§ß ### When I was learning how to write, when I was a small kid, by writing the whole line with the same letter, I was erasing the written letter and correcting it (so that it would be drawn perfectly) so many times that the page was visibly damaged and thin. I spent a lot of time on it and I couldn't move on. ### mine was actually the very same one that you mentioned, omg.
I had major anxiety that if I didnt pray for everyone, in the right order, they'd die.
so that one and things having to stand in their designated spots and doors always being opened a fist wide. ### I used to force myself to sleep facing the door (in case there were monsters), no matter how uncomfortable. I'd lie there for hours not being able to fall asleep cause I just got super cramped up and sweaty until exhaustion made me fall asleep. ### I used to do that to!!!!! I would say my prayer and then mention every person in my family (and pets) and try to keep it in one breath. Then i would say amen until it ‚Äúfelt right.‚Äù And then it kindof morphed into saying that list of names in that same order under my breath at random times during the day. Over and over and over. It‚Äôs crazy you did the same thing with the list. ### At around 9/10 I had convinced myself that I was going to go to jail at some point in my life. I was pretty scared of getting caught doing bad things thinking I was going to get arrested lol. 

That then evolved into me thinking I was a psychopath which continued for like 6 years until I got finally diagnosed lol ### Repeately touching things and saying words ### I remember playing computer games like Age of Empires in my room and once it hit 8-9pm I'd start having ""bad thoughts""- basically intrusive thoughts that I was wasting my life away and my parents could die any minute and that I wasn't spending enough time with them. I was 8 years old. 

It's the intrusive thought pattern that never went away. I still get pangs of guilt and anxiety in my chest if I'm playing video games alone in my dorm and haven't seen my parents within the last week or so. I still get those thoughts of waking up and my parents being dead. My compulsion is to spend time with them. Which isn't bad, obviously, but I know I'll still be anxious later and my OCD will taint the time I *compulsively* spend with them.

Around that time I also developed the fear of people being able to read my mind. ### Around 4 years old, I started peeling the skin on my feet. Around middle school, the focus moved from my feet to my face. I didn't learn that excoriation disorder, skin picking or dermatillomania is OCD-related until I read something about Just Right OCD a few days ago.

I had intrusive thoughts about opening the car door while the car was moving and throwing myself out of the car, but I can't imagine that I would have been capable of taking my seat belt off and unlocking the door due to scrupulosity. ### any time anyone spoke to me, i would repeat what they said in my head once. when i responded, i repeated it in my head three times. when the interaction was over, i would repeat the whole thing in my head over and over again. while i did all of this i would usually mouth along. safe to say i confused a lot of people by mouthing what they said back to myself before responding. ### For me, it was when I was five, hugging all of my stuffies in a specific order in a specific way, every night. Because I thought that if I didn't, they would hurt me in some way. When I look back, I just think 'wow, how could I ever think that was a normal thought to have as a child'. ### Every night I had to say ‚Äúsee you in the morning‚Äù to my mum and she would have to repeat it back or I would be inconsolable ### another one was when i was young, i heard about bloody mary and had to cover all the mirrors when i went to bed and chant ‚Äúi love my family and friends‚Äù over and and over again or else something, maybe bloody mary, would get me in the dark. this lasted way longer than a little kid being scared of the dark too ### As a child, I was convinced that after burping or farting, you should say ""Excuse Me"" or else you'd be contaminating the air and people around you. I can remember myself as young as 4 having a meltdown because the preschool boys had a burping contest and they wouldn't say ""Excuse Me"" afterwards. It happened again in 3rd grade, but the adults in my life told me I needed to learn that I can't control everybody all the time and the dramatics would only make life worse. In therapy now, and my therapist was the first person who told me that my OCD caused those meltdowns and that I wasn't a bad kid for being overwhelmed. ### In my mid to late teens i used to infinity-check weather the doors / windows / windowblinds / courtains were REALLY locked / closed and over and over and over again but in a kind of self-conscious way, in which I knew that I did it just to calm my anxiety, but at the time I didn‚Äôt know that was a thing called OCD because I thought OCD was like cleaning n germs n assymetty and stuff. ### I would repeat soothing mantras in my head to make sure I wouldn't get killed or die in my sleep lol ### Think like 5th/6th grade I would have to jump in my bed a certain way or it wouldn't feel right so I'd have to get up and keep jumping in my bed until it felt right then I could go to sleep. ### maybe in 3rd grade? i had to chew everything in threes on each side of my mouth ### When I was 6/7 I used to have to say in my head that my mom was fine and was not going to die before closing doors (not every door but very often when I thought about it) or I would think she would. I would reopen and close multiple times depending on the mood/day if I felt I didn‚Äôt think it correctly. My dad did die when I was a month shy of 4, so I think that‚Äôs gotta be where the anxiety stemmed from. I also remember not doing it when I was around others so I didn‚Äôt like being alone. ### The earliest thing I remember is being very germophobic about injuries, I had severe food poisoning when I was 6 which sent me to hospital. I still remember how painful and exhausting it was, I just laid on the floor shitting and puking for days.

So after that I developed a fear of getting sick and I remember I'd be very OTT about cleaning wounds, for example one time I scratched my foot open on a bamboo outdoor sofa, it was quite a gash, proper ripped my foot open as if I was stabbed. I washed it a lot and smeared a very generous amount of antiseptic cream directly into it and check on my wounds repeatedly with concerns of infection. Always checked my wounds obsessively like that ever since, every cat scratch, insect bite etc. ### I would play a game that involved me asking myself, ‚Äúif this happens, then _______ won‚Äôt/will happen.‚Äù I still do it sometimes, but that‚Äôs one of the first symptoms I remember. I would also ask people for reassurance. ### I still do this to this day hahaha ### There were lots of small things looking back but one that sticks in my head is that I got a hamster when I was around 8 and I began to get doubts about whether I'd closed the cage door. I ran up and down the stairs all evening 'double checking' and fully believing each time that I'd carelessly left the door open and the hamster would be gone. I'd also frequently wake my poor hamster up to check he was alive. My mum was frustrated and said something like, 'you're going to kill yourself with worry when you one day have a baby'. Here I am finally getting therapy at 33 because I'd like a baby and don't fancy dying of worry. ### One time as a kid my dad took me and my siblings to a war museum. I was maybe like 7/8? 
I was so stressed out by what I‚Äôd seen there, that for the next week or so every night when I‚Äôd hear an aeroplane fly past (quite a lot as we‚Äôre under a flight path) I‚Äôd have to get up and ‚Äòcheck‚Äô that we weren‚Äôt being invaded üò≠ 
It‚Äôs a funny story but does make me wonder how far back these kind of things go‚Ä¶ ### I used to roll up a piece of paper and tell myself if I get it in the bin everything will be ok. 10 throws in the wind and mom is honkiing at me because im late for school. ### I feel like it was the idea of appendicitis, that terrified me all childhood. Primarily because of wrong understanding of the cause of it and lack of insurance it won‚Äôt happen to me. It‚Äôs like a time bomb. I obsessed about it a lot, I did everything I could to prevent it from happening. Stories about people having it twice scared me, stories about people not having it at all uplifted. But silver lining - excluding junk food and washing hands I consider now good habits, although some irrational still exist, like I always put stuff into my left pocket and it feels uncomfortable to try use right one ### Probably repeatedly walking backwards through a doorway with my eyes closed until it felt like I did it just right. Thankfully this wasn't that debilitating and I only did it 6 times max (most likely always 6 times because it was 1 more than 5 and I thought 5 was enough so 6 should be more than enough).

I did this when I was a kid and totally forgot about it until I saw the Scrubs episode with Michael J Fox walking through a doorway repeatedly too. So I thought I outgrew it since I don't do that anymore.. but ocd manifests itself in many different ways and I had no idea. ### I don't remember my exact age but it had to be 6 or 7 possibly a little younger. I was camping with my family and my dad and I walked up to the little campground store to get something. On our way out I saw the Mortal Kombat machine and really wanted to play he let me pop one quarter in and when I inevitably died the character I had chosen began falling down a well as the countdown giving you time to enter another quarter began. I was ready to walk away but my dad wanted to see how it ended when the guy landed, I watched the character I had chosen land on a bed of spikes at the bottom and boom, my first theme arose. For the rest of the camping trip, and for a good two or three years after that I lived in constant fear that I was going to fall through the ground at any moment and land on those spikes. I had a great love of swimming my entire childhood until my next theme sprang off from that one and I began to fear being sucked through the bottom of the lake. ### Washing my hands, flipping my hair to fix it, overusing products and biting my nails. ### I remember not liking even numbers. I somehow got the idea that basically odd numbers are the good guys and even numbers are the bad guys, and when I had to write down an even number for schoolwork, I would hold contempt for that number.
I also felt the right side of my body was the ""good"" side and the left side was bad (I'm right-handed). I would favor doing things with my right side, and when I had to use my left hand or whatever to do something, I would basically talk shit about the left side of my body in my mind ### My first compulsion I remember was constantly checking if the sun was still in the sky. I felt like if I didn‚Äôt it would fall and we would all die. The first intrusive thoughts were ones about killing my family. I would stay up all night because I felt like if I went to sleep my thoughts would ‚Äútake over‚Äù and I would kill everyone I loved. I think about little baby me and I just want to give her a hug and tell her it‚Äôs going to be ok. ### the first symptom i can remember was hoarding. i was around 5/6 and felt an overwhelming need to keep trash (receipts, straws, ANY paper that i had drawn on, etc.). i vividly remember the dread and anxiety i‚Äôd feel on trash pickup days worrying that i was losing something. my parents resorted to keeping a tub in the garage that was designated for things that i ‚Äúneeded to keep‚Äù, they said once it was full they‚Äôd put it away and get a new one. i hoarded pretty badly until about the age of 12- even at 22 i still find myself compulsively keeping random things like bottlecaps, receipts, tags and stuff. i have a wide range of OCD symptoms but hoarding has got to be one of the more frustrating ones. ### When I was a kid. Can‚Äôt remember the exact age but I remember going in & out of my mother‚Äôs room at least 10x because I thought she was going to die in her sleep if I didn‚Äôt close the door the way that felt comfortable to me. Does that makes sense? Same with kisses on her cheek. I would do it over & over until I felt comfortable with it. I didn‚Äôt even know what OCD was at the time.

Also, I‚Äôve gotten into so many fights with my sisters over touching my organized things. Even if they put it in the exact same spot, I knew it was off. We‚Äôve verbally & physically fought because they taunted me. They knew it bothered me but did it anyway. ### i remember when i was maybe 7 thinking if i sneezed or yawned while we went over a bridge in the car it would collapse in on us and we would all die ### Counting the syllables that people said or sang in the square of a square in my brain. No idea why, I would just get the urge to start counting and I wouldn‚Äôt stop until the sentence or song ended on the fourth spot on my mental square. Not sure if that makes sense to anyone but me lol ### Ever since I was young before I could even remember I used to ( still do to this day ) twiddle things in my fingers, threads, hair etc into a little ball ### When i was younger i was absolutely terrible at sharing, giving people my stuff gave me anxiety through the roof because when id play with toys id only set them up ""perfectly""... later this was determined to be one of my first symptoms ### not one that i necessarily remember (at least entirely) but my mom told me when i was really young her and my grandma (her mom) would talk about how they would be in a room and be like ‚Äúwhere‚Äôd that *random household object ex. vase, picture, etc* go? i just moved it over here!‚Äù and they found out i was moving it back to where we had always had that vase or picture placed. figured this was an OCD symptom since i couldn‚Äôt stand when things were in the ‚Äúwrong spot‚Äù even though they were just redecorating/reorganizing ### I hid scissors and other sharp objects in the hope I‚Äôd forget where they were, so I couldn‚Äôt ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù slice my own neck or wrists. ### I got head lice when I was in 3rd grade.
Every single night following for the next two years I would check my head for hours for lice before I could fall asleep. If I would find a single flake of dandruff I‚Äôd go find a parent to make sure it wasn‚Äôt a nit. After two years my parents took me to a psychiatrist and I slowly realized many of the things I‚Äôd been doing my whole life (rewriting the same assignment over and over until it looked ‚Äúright‚Äù, counting how many steps I take everywhere, not being able to leave a room without stepping outside with a certain foot first, on and on) were 100% OCD related. ### symmetry. counting telephone poles while looking out the window on road trips and mentally measuring whether they were equidistant. ### I can‚Äôt believe that I‚Äôm not the only person who did something very similar! No matter how exhausted or sleepy I was, very single night I had to pray that my loved ones (in the order: dad, mom, brother, me, uncle and aunt, grandfather and grandmothers) will only die when they get very very old. I used to believe that if I missed even a single day, they would die young or whenever. I used to also pray that I don‚Äôt die in my sleep hehe. I stopped all this around 2 years back. Though I laugh about it now, I used to feel extremely embarrassed about it back when I used to do it and hated myself. And I NEVER would‚Äôve  believed that there are other people who did this! ### i remember being in my stroller constantly wiping the crumbs out from underneath me because i hated the idea that i was sitting on crumbs, which evolved into having to sit on a jacket or blanket or sit on my feet in any chair or place to sit besides anything in my house. 

it went away for a while but now i have it again and i have a jacket i call my sitting jacket which i will use to sit on everything. only safe place to sit for me is the carpeted floor of my house and bathroom floor. ### In first grade I used to think that there was an invisible string attached to me, so I had to walk in a pattern that the ‚Äústring‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt get me stuck. This could be walking through desks or around school, I always had to walk back the same way I came or else I thought I‚Äôd get stuck. The other thing I remember is I had a specific stool I would sit at in my parents house and I would move it back and forth until it felt right. I couldn‚Äôt sit until it felt just right. ### I did this too! I was afraid if I didnt list off every family member in my prayer and say that i didnt want them sick, die, etc, that somehow someone would be hurt if they got left out. I also have a memory of an intrusive thought about my achilles tendon being severed that went back to at least when I was 9, because I remember always pulling my heels up in class because of it. Its definitely interesting to look back at things I did as a kid and never noted that jump out as ocd related behaviors/tendencies ### My first compulsion arose when I was five; it was making sure the heads of my lego minifigures were in the centre. ### Washing my hands a certain amount of times to make sure that they were \*really\* clean. I believed that if I didn't wash my hands that certain amount of times, then I didn't care about putting my family at risk due to my dirty hands (and the things I would contaminate with them). Man, those 4th grade days. The OCD has morphed into many other things over the years, but this is my first clear memory of an OCD symptom. ### Mine made me be seen as a harasser. And people Threatened to call the cops on me. ### Religious ocd and through years I picked a lot of different themes ### My first ocd symptoms I can remember are related to my Tourette‚Äôs. I had a tic where I would blow on my hands when I was 8 or 9, and this eventually developed into a compulsion where I had to blow on my hands after touching other things or people. Lol ### Making sure my horse‚Äôs stall door was really closed. ### Touching everything multiple times or touching everything my brother touched in any shop. ### I only realise it now but as a kid I used to walk up or down stairs starting with my left foot and always aiming to end that last step with my right foot. Or memorizing the number of steps in specific places like my grandmother‚Äôs house so i could accurately start and end on the correct foot. ### don't step on a crack (or line) or you'll break your mother's back.   sounds crazy but on the off chance what-if ?  best not to risk it.    i was a child of 8 i think. ### Contamination OCD has long been my major theme.

Apart from the handwashing until my hands bled, probably doorknobs? I refused to touch them both at home and at school, would come up with all sorts of ways to avoid it. ### My ears had to be covered to sleep. Or bugs would get in them. I still have to cover my ears to sleep ### When I was super young (like 3) my mom told me I used to collect dust and lint and then order them based on size.

I also remember as a kid, I would always chew the same amount of food on both sides of my mouth (still do) and another odd thing I would do is if I touched something with one finger (for example, tapping a table or using a keyboard) I would have to do the same with every other finger. I also always had to walk the same amount of steps on every square of a sidewalk ### When I was little, I kept thinking that Satan was asking me to sell my soul. I once told my parents about it, crying, and they explained that the concept of ""selling your soul"" is not in the Bible, and is just a made up thing by movies. That seemed to calm my anxiety down and I wasn't scared of Satan asking for my soul anymore.

I now recognize that the ""Satan asking for my soul"" was an intrusive thought. Even as a child, I realized it was not the voice of Satan, but rather my own head. But despite me knowing it was my own thoughts, the fact that I was thinking about it at all made me think that I somehow wanted Satan to have my soul. My parent's re-assurance worked really well, so maybe in some ways it enabled me to ignore those thoughts. After all, if it's not even possible to sell your soul, how could I subconsciously be doing it?

I had other symptoms as a child but that's one of the earliest I can remember.

I also remember suddenly thinking about the fact that male relatives had penises. I didn't like thinking about my grandpa's or uncle's penis. But it would suddenly pop into my head. I now recognize those as instrusive thoughts but at the time I found it really gross. I rarely think about it nowadays and if I do I tend to just shrug it off and avoid giving it attention. ### I would type words out with my fingers as people would talk to me. I wouldn't type everything just interesting words. I would literally move my fingers as if they were typing ever so slightly. ### i remember when i was around 7 i started with really bad intrusive thoughts that someone hid a camera in my vents. i would spend the whole night every night trying to catch it blinking and cowering from it. then i started checking the candles that my mom lit like ten times every night because i was sure that it was catch my house on fire. ### Keeping empty bottles of water that my dad bought me because if I didn't he would pass away and it would be my fault. ### stepping on cracks and pattered flooring. ### I would check the date on my food packaging 9
Times before eating it. ### recurrent intrusive thoughts about wanting to commit violence to a bird ### I used to get stomach pains until I told my mom that I thought of a curse word. 
Used to pop my jaw to the point I may have hurt it. 
I would say out loud Love God hate the devil 
Probably much more that I'm not thinking of. It used to be referred to as my habits. I've still never been officially diagnosed at 35. Also I remember getting super anxious about the end of the world and tabloids upset me. ### Had to have doors closed at all times. Had to. ### i used to have meltdowns over the radio volume not being on a 0,1,3,5,7,10,11,13 . . . number and i could only sit on the right side of the car cuz it felt weird if my entire view was not of the left ### Oh, I have a list of them from earliest to latest.
 My earliest was probably asking my parents to cut out the picture of a cow from the horizon milk or it would die. It was never, in fact, alive.
 Then came the ‚Äúyour house will burn down when you‚Äôre at school if you don‚Äôt XYZ‚Äù
 Then, what if people can read your mind?
 Then, imagine your classmate from algebra having sex with you. 
 My most recent is a combination of sex mental images and people reading my mind. ### i rewrote every word until i thought it was perfect - a lot of the times I would erase so much/so hard that there were holes in my homework ### When I was 5 I was learning to use a pen. During class I went up to the teacher and said that my letters weren‚Äôt right and I had to keep going over them - I was tracing the letters so many time that the pen was going through the page. She gave me a new pen. ### Now that you say it, I do remember praying every night for the next day to be a good one and for everyone around me to be okay.

 I thought that, if I missed something or someone the night before, I would be afraid for that part of my prayer to not be fulfilled and the worst would happen. ### Oh wow.. I‚Äôm 28 and have never realised this is part of my ocd. I‚Äôve done this for as long as I can remember? I‚Äôm not even remotely religious but when I would pray for something (out of desperation) I would have to finish it off with a certain exact phrase followed by a certain hand action. 

Couple of years ago I told my partner that I actually do this and he‚Äôs the only person in the world who knows that about me! 

Huh.. thanks üòÖ ### As far back as I can remember I didn‚Äôt play like the other kids because I spent most of my time organizing all the toys and making sure what was supposed to be together was all together; such as Barbie clothes and fake food. I played for a short time after cus I usually tired myself out beforehand. Next was my inability to eat things that weren‚Äôt supposed to touch did touch. ### Not stepping on cracks‚Ä¶

Feeling guilty for ‚Äúthinking‚Äù of curse words 

Having to knock and do everything 10 times ### My first OCD symptom started when I was four. I remember having to step into every sidewalk space (not just the squares, but every full piece including those that were produced via cracks across sidewalks squares) with my right foot first, and then my left foot could go down. The compulsion quickly developed and I not only had to step right-foot-first, but also four steps per sidewalk space (right, left, right, left). I ended up having to do this weird little jump-dance routine whenever I would walk in order to satisfy the compulsion, and I felt that something terrible would happen if I didn't do it - I would often feel that my parents would die, or that I would die if I didn't follow my compulsions exactly as my child brain instructed me to behave. My grandma had a hard time walking me to school around the corner from our house because of how badly my OCD slowed us down, and as a tiny child I couldn't articulate what was going on, so she couldn't understand what was wrong and didn't know how to help me. 

 I think in a strange way I knew that the behavior wasn't normal only because it made me feel so anxious and afraid. I was a relatively unhappy and nervous child, and I remember most of my dread happening in concert with the worsening of my OCD. ### When I learned what bad words were I started confessing to my parents each time I heard one in my head (which was quite often) ### That‚Äôs wild mine was almost exactly the same as yours. I‚Äôd say the Hail Mary and say everyone‚Äôs name and pray that they‚Äôd never die and I‚Äôd end it with an our father. My dad died when I was 9 and thats when my OCD started so it contributed a lot to the praying no one dies part. ### I would try to guess the exact time without looking at my watch. If I guessed right my parents wouldn‚Äôt divorce, if I guessed wrong they would. I played a lot of games like that with myself. I also remember picking my skin since I was about 7. ### it was the same thing for me. but not just every night, every time I had bad thoughts about my loved ones (about them being sick, etc) I always did a whole prayer for everyone I cared about. more than once a lot of the times. ### i remember it starting with my brain telling me things like ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt get out of bed & touch the wall on the other side of your bedroom you will wake up sick tomorrow and then you won‚Äôt be able to go to school‚Äù. this really scared me because i had anxiety about missing school and not getting perfect grades as a young kid and i‚Äôd be up forever doing all these things to make sure i‚Äôd be able to go to school the next day. ### I have two and I can‚Äôt remember which came first. First was covering myself with pillows and sleeping in weird positions so that if an intruder came in they wouldn‚Äôt be able to stab my heart and then I could wake up and scream. The other was lining up my stuffed animals in a row and rotating them so they all got equal love and wouldn‚Äôt get angry and harm me or my family when they ‚Äúwoke up at night‚Äù. ### Counting how many steps were in between me and my friends house down the road. I would remember the number was 29 every time and if it was 28 or 30 I would go back and re walk. Also waking up to make sure my mom was still breathing. Also I developed trichotillomania when I was 6. Makes me so sad that my childhood was completely controlled by this disease. ### As like a toddler I was TERRIFIED of using the toilet, I was convinced something bad would happen if I did. My mom says I would sob like ugly sob about it, I was like so scared. ### Similar. Also, if there was litter anywhere I was walking that I noticed, I would have to pick it up otherwise I was bad or something bad would happen and god was watching. 
Other one would be my stuffed animal dog named after my dog that died, If I didn‚Äôt lay it on the bed nice and neat then that meant that I didn‚Äôt care about people or things. ### my earliest ever memory was feeling uncomfortable by the idea that either nobody had touched every single strand of carpet in my room or that a bunch of random people had and my steps hadn‚Äôt covered every inch of my carpet. so i would walk on it in a pattern with short steps to make sure i got every piece of carpet. but after i finished i‚Äôd wonder if i actually got all of it. so i did it again. and again. and again and again and again until it felt ‚Äúright‚Äù. 

a few other childhood ones where i had yours, too, and did it twice a day in the morning at night with all the other prayers! i understand your viewpoint on this and being raised christian and terrified of being smited by a disappointed god was scary as well- 

then some other basic childhood stuff. repeating patterns, lost my shit about a bad fabric on my legs, couldnt stand things being empty or unclean or out of place (i thought they‚Äôd make something bad happen) and general anxiety about every action i did. i wanted so badly to be perfect even in the stuff no one would notice or have a perception of what perfect is ### Counting and timing everything. ### When I was in kindergarten and we'd eat lunch, I HATED sitting on the benches because I felt they were contaminated. And during assemblies, I'd only squat. Teachers always assumed I was beaten :/ ### Being aware of my eyes blinking ugh ### The first one I remember was when I was in fourth grade and I lied to my teacher about remembering to get something from my bag earlier in the day in order to avoid a check (a really minor punishment but something I hadn‚Äôt had before). I cried the entire night and confessed to my parents at home, insisting they figure out the teacher‚Äôs phone number so I could tell her immediately. They said they couldn‚Äôt do that so I was in agony until I was able to tell her the first thing the next morning ### I continued to tie and re-tie my shoes until they felt like the same tightness. ### That I needed to have my own clean bath towels because I was convinced my sister was wiping her toothpaste onto the clean towels. ### I am shocked to hear about other people praying. I am not religious, but have prayed nightly since I was about 13. It always starts with ‚ÄúDear God and all my family, friends, people who aren‚Äôt my friends, and all their pets (presumably in heaven), please watch over all my family, friends, people who aren‚Äôt my friends, and all of their pets.‚Äù I also pray for my children to have happy, healthy, and successful lives. Please keep them safe. 

It is so surprising to learn that others have similar approaches!!

My first memory of OCD was when I was in preschool. I would make noises or sounds and have to repeat them in perfect cadence or pronunciation for X amount of times, and then say ‚ÄúDone.‚Äù If I said done in a different way than normal, I‚Äôd have to repeat the whole process again X amount of times until I said it right. I remember my parents being so annoyed and I finally got myself to stop, just for it to return a few months later. 

I never made the connection to it being OCD until I was diagnosed and reflected on every repetitive behavior I‚Äôve had. ### I also grew up Christian and had to pray every night in a specific way or I was scared about my family and friends having some bad things happen to them. So long as I did it the thoughts went away. ### Anyone else have to rewrite letters and other things if you mess up. It's definitely abnormal how many times I rewrite things. ### I used to check faucets to see if there was any water leak‚Ä¶ ### I would stack my stuffed toys a certain way every night before bed, when I was small.  If I didn't,  I would be murdered along with my sister by some horror film character. I used to think it was normal, but now it seems more in line with OCD. I guess it kind of went away until I turned 16, and now I've experiencing Pure O OCD obsessions for almost 2 and a half years now. It was at it's peak during the fall when I started uni and was bad enough to the point that I failed all midterms and missed finals. I'm just a homebody now :( ### Knocking on my teachers desk twice before walking away. ### Repeating handwritten notes in pen over and over until I had gotten them right. Trying multiple different handwritings to find which one felt acceptable. I would grip the pen very hard in order to make the letters dark and neat, even if it meant getting callouses on my fingers. If I messed up handwriting, grammar, even bullet point placement, I would have to restart all the notes (which were, again, in pen bc I couldn‚Äôt stand the look of erased words). Still an issue to this day, to the point that I developed tendonitis in my dominant wrist and had to type notes for months until it improved. I was told that if I continue doing that, I would have recurring tendonitis and possibly carpal tunnel syndrome, but I still can‚Äôt break the compulsions. ### Holy (no pun intended) shit. I did the same thing!!!!!! I was not brought up super religious or anything, but knew about prayer. And so I'd say goodnight to those I lost in heaven and the pray for the well-being and safety of all my loved ones. I could not go to sleep without doing that. And then it continued to evolve- long and longer. More complicated. Adding things. I was so afraid I'd be the reason someone got hurt or even had a horrible day if I did not pray. I can't believe I'm not alone. ### I think one of my first signs I noticed was around age 7-8. I needed to alternate bites I took of food on each side of my mouth or else I was convinced something bad was going to happen to me after eating, whether that was choking or indigestion or whatever. Didn‚Äôt matter what I was eating, but if I took one bite, I‚Äôd have to chew with the left side of my teeth first and then my right.

The amount of food I ate had to be even too. I had to scoop a similar sized portion or the same number of pieces each time! Eating lowkey still takes me a while because I still do the balancing of bite size thing lol.

I can also relate extremely to the religious tendencies! I grew up Christian as well and always recited the same prayers before bed in the same way, with the emphasis on thanking God for keeping my family and friends safe and alive. I still struggle with that one, the chewing is less of an issue. Now my day to day with OCD is mainly managing intrusive thoughts and my constant checking that things are actually ‚Äúclosed‚Äù or ‚Äúoff‚Äù. ### I was in 4th grade and would tap out this one piano song all day everyday.  I still do it sometimes against my leg. ### I had two. One of them was the same as this one, I had to say a prayer every night in a specific way because I was afraid my mom would die if I didn‚Äôt. If I didn‚Äôt feel right after the prayer, I‚Äôd say it again. 
The other Was checking under my bed and in my closet before bed to make sure nothing was there that could kill me. But every time I‚Äôd get in bed I‚Äôd decide I needed to check one more time. What if I was wrong? This could go on for a very long time. ### I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs related but I was preparing myself to jump off the car in case of an accident ### I remember going to school in kindergarten and people asking me why my hands were covered in scabs. I would wash them until they were cracked and dry and bleeding. ### Yeah, I make myself say a prayer in my head. I‚Äôm not even Christian anymore, but I still make myself say it. I even tried letting myself just count to 10 in my head instead, but then I ended up just saying the prayer followed by counting to 10. I started doing this in elementary school (but I still do it) ### It had to do with sleeping ### If I turn one way I have to turn the other, or if I walk one way I have to walk back the exact same ### Tbh idk if this was a symptom or not, but when I was in elementary I had this huge fear of choking, like I would eat a very limited amount of safe foods, and anything I put in my mouth that didn‚Äôt  ‚Äúfeel right‚Äù to swallow, I would just go to the bathroom and spit it out. Took me like 5 yrs to finally get over it. My family still makes fun of me for it to this day lol ### I had a litany/prayer that I said nightly, similar to this. Also have always liked counting things, especially things that were even numbered. ### Kept impulsively getting the urge to kiss my 60 year old piano teacher, was so mortified that I sat on my hands the whole lesson almost (except for when playing). ### I dealt with rumination from a pretty young age. I usually obsessed over what others thought of me, and I would go out of my way to avoid them or become them. Lots of people thought I was just a sensitive and insecure kid, but looking back, I see some early signs of OCD. ### Making sure my light was off, and also thinking that if someone touched me, other people could see it. Example being another kid touched my butt in elementary school, I was so anxious and upset because I thought other people could see it and think I was gross. Idk if that's ocd though or even makes sense, but does ocd ever *really* make sense? Lmao ### feeling very isolated socially, food aversion, obsessing over losing my mom, skin picking/nail biting ### This was me too and I still struggle with it. I have to say prayer exactly in the same order or else I will feel the urge to start over. ### I also slapped my cousin, I kept having the thought in my head over and over. So when I acted upon it I was terrified that I was going to continue to hurt the ones I love. ### Apparently I used to ask my English teacher all the time if I‚Äôm doing this or that correctly just to make sure I did everything perfect

Oh boy 8th grade me you don‚Äôt know how much fun you‚Äôll have with ocd in college ### I remember laying in bed horrified looking at my mirror, scared to death that I was going to recite Bloody Mary three times and die.

Didn‚Äôt trust myself ### Feeling like if I didn't drink 5 cans a pop at a time then one of my friends would die. I was about 11. ### When I was in the 4th grade kids started saying the thing about making a wish whenever you looked at the clock and the time was the same number, like 3:33 or 11:11, and pulling out a loose lash and blowing on it. I end up developing that as an obsession to the point where I got a sense for when a certain amount of time passed and that would happen, and I felt bad if I didn't do it everytime. Blah blah blah so on and so forth, I've developed trichotilomania and still struggle with it everyday. I also had this thing where I'd go ""Mm mm"" as if I was clearing my throat but it was just an urge to make the noise. I now know that that was a verbal tic that I probably did when I was anxious, but at the time it was weird and I couldn't explain why it was happening. ### I remember having to walk the same amount of steps in each sidewalk square on my walk home from school. Starting about 2nd grade ### Not being able to sleep at night because I‚Äôd focus on my heart beat or my breath (manually breathing) not being able to pay attention in class for the same reasons ### I used to have a chupa chups brand magic 8 ball style toy (where you push a button and a light goes from yes to no), I remember when I was at my dads house missing my mum I would press it to ‚Äúsee if she was okay‚Äù then that would go up to the most prevalent answer out of 5, and then up by fives. 

However my mum says she remembers me as a toddler collecting pacifiers to the point to leave the house I‚Äôd need one in my mouth and one in each hand or I‚Äôd scream. Not sure if you can have symptoms that young but it stands out ### I pray a very similar prayer every night‚Ä¶ ‚Äúplease be with me and *spouse‚Äôs name*and our family and friends and our plans and goals and health‚Ä¶‚Äù and so on and sometimes I have to repeat it until it sounds ‚Äúright‚Äù‚Ä¶  
Theres some variation every time but I pray for pretty much the same thing every time and I feel weird if I dont pray for me and my loved ones plans and goals and health‚Ä¶. 
but I also feel like im not religious or spiritual enough for praying about the same things.    
    
TDLR: I pray about the same things every day, and if I say it weird I have to repeat until it sounds right. ### Everytime I‚Äôm in the cr. I would arrange my toiletries and if it wasn‚Äôt arranged I‚Äôm thinking that I will have bud luck for that day and will not even finish my work successfully ### My grandma used to tie my hair for me before school when I was a kid. My parents were going through a divorce at the time, and my grandma favours my brother so I saw our hair routine as a treasured event every morning. She didn‚Äôt get up to do my hair one day and I cried like hell. Everyone thought I was throwing a whole tantrum episode and I got scolded and all, but I knew I wasn‚Äôt being angsty because I started seeing it as routine by then and I felt so panicky and violated I couldn‚Äôt explain myself. I just remember feeling like I couldn‚Äôt breathe and felt sick afterwards but they just dropped me off at school while I cried the whole time. I remember thinking that the whole day was going to be so bad just because my grandma didn‚Äôt tie my hair, but I went back to being okay once she kept to the routine in the days that followed. 

I was diagnosed with OCD 6 years later, and PTSD, Panic disorder, ED and depression in the years after. ### For me it was these wildly lucid, repetitive dreams that made me question my religious beliefs and fear if I was going to hell. Honestly, when I was a kid my OCD kicked in very early. Now looking back it probably started at like age 5 or close to that. 

I literally would stay up all night scared that I was going to go to hell because of some past events and I remember it got so bad, that by the time I was 12 I begun experiencing sleep paralysis because all I would do is stay up all night playing video games to prevent my thoughts.

On top of that, I got bullied around that age and was an outcast at school. I got in fights, got beat up a few times, and my parents split up for a while. I remember my mom would have guys at the house and stuff.

This one time, I caught her next door at a house party flirting with some dude and she gaslighted me and manipulated me into thinking I just imagined it all that kind of messed me up for a while. Especially after she begun threatening to put me on Renalin. 

I normally try to avoid my past, but I see how bad it gets and I want to help people. I have tamed probably 75% of my OCD and it honestly wasn‚Äôt that hard for me. People can refute this all day, but working out and having a decent mindset definitely play a part in recovery. I‚Äôm not even that strong but lifting and overall physical fitness has become a part of my routine and it has helped me get my mind off things a lot. Just remember if any of you try this, weight lifting is very dangerous, you can get injured or even killed very easily if your not observant and I‚Äôm not exaggerating. ### Saying ""fuck you god I hate you"" in my head during class prayer time and then absolutely hating myself for it while repeating it again and again and again. I was maybe 8 or 9. ### You literally plucked this from my brain wth ### Everything gotta be in chronological order ### The first symptom that I can remember was back when I was in middle school about 20 years ago.  I remember the school that I attended had square tiles as the flooring and when I walked through the school I always had to walk in a specific pattern on the tiles.  More specifically, when I walked on the tiles I had to make sure that my feet always stepped in an L formation, much in the same way as a knight moves on a chess board.  Ever since then my OCD has only gotten worse with both my compulsions and my obsessions. ### this was literally me as a kid. i was raised catholic and was VERY religious as a child even though my family wasn't.
i would also pray every night by first saying the lord's prayer and then repeating my own 'prayer' and if i fucked up the phrasing i would restart it over and over again. i literally couldn't fall asleep if i didn't do it 'right'.

for 15 years i thought i was just a really devout christian, but turns out it was just ocd lol.

i'm a raging atheist now. ### Wow. I did the same exact thing w the prayers! Never related it to ocd. Mind blown. ### Dermatillomania!  I‚Äôve had it since I was like 6 ### Making sure I walked on the same side of a pole as my friends or family because I was worried it will take me to a different universe, roughly around 4ish, ### same !! everytime i would pray, i would get dirty intrusive thoughts and i would have to do it all over again. or if i felt like i didn‚Äôt put much ‚Äúeffort‚Äù. ### Someone told me not to step on cracks (you've heard the rhyme) and I've had trouble with it ever since - worse when I'm stressed. I've got other symptoms, but that was the first I remember. ### Getting out of bed to check the door knobs locks and windows when I was 5 ### I actually still have these symptoms after like 4 years. 
So I remember I always wanted the volume on the radio to end in a 0 or 5. The other one is I have to sit on the left side of the car, idk why but whenever I sat on the right side it didn't feel right lol. ### I started having thoughts about my loved ones like ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt love your mom‚Äù and it was so horrible. i still get them now but they‚Äôve developed into something even more distressing ### I remember as a kid I rang at someone‚Äòs house for a prank and ran away. Thought for 2 years the police was after me like murderer or sth‚Ä¶ ### Blinking compulsion when I was in middle school

Light switches too ### I was in preschool and a kid at the lunch table threw up. I refused to wear the same shirt ever again (even though his vomit got nowhere near me) because it was ‚Äúdirty‚Äù, even after being washed. ### I don‚Äôt know if it was the first but what sticks out in my mind is hair twirling. I would spin specific pieces of hair around my fingers in a certain pattern and it would increase a lot if I was anxious and tired and people would just laugh at my ‚Äúquirk‚Äù or when driving along in the car if both sides of the road didn‚Äôt both have a reflector light post I would mentally have to knock down the single one to make sure that everything stayed okay. ### I had ‚Äúbad thoughts‚Äù that I had a compulsive need to confess to my mom. ### if my the side of my hand touched a surface, i had to make sure the rest of my hand touched that surface too ### Not sure if they were symptoms for sure but when I was a little kid I was worried about contamination and I remember my dad saying that pee particles aren‚Äôt going to fly from my friends house to mine. 
Also I remember making sure to pray certain things or else people would get sick (religion has really messed with me and my ocd. I‚Äôm no longer Christian though that‚Äôs a different topic to discuss) ### I learnt about germs in kindergarten and started needing to wash the ""poison"" from my hands before eating and doing much of anything. ### My first OCD theme happened at about 12.  I was convinced if I didn't do my numbers correctly or enter a room with the appropriate thoughts I would have Down Syndrome (crazy I know).  It paralyzed me.  I would have to see the number 23 in my head (chromosomes) and if 24 popped up I would go into panic and have to redo a whole collection of steps.  I can see now that my esteem was so low that I thought there must be a reason and that the world just wasn't telling me the truth.  No one knew what was wrong with me, OCD wasn't widely considered at that time.  All I knew is my brain was short circuiting.  I had to beg my mother to get into therapy as I knew I couldn't go on like this.  Funny, when a theme subsides and changes the previous theme has no effect.  I can work with people with down syndrome and one of my favorite NFL players has the number 24 jersey. OCD has had many themes in my life, from a fear of having HIV, to religious themes as they are now.  Numbers, numbers, numbers roll through my head like waves constantly battering the shore.  Knowing that there is a underlying biological cause helps but those compulsions can still stab you like a knife.  It's a lifelong malady and one I just have to accept and learn to live with as best as I can. ### omg yes same! i would just start praying for all people instead of naming them because i got scared if i left someone out i was a horrible person üò≠ i also remember being like 5 or 6 and having to ask go to save me over and over again just incase it didn‚Äôt work the first time ### I had this paper snowflake I made and every night as I was going to bed I would say (out loud) a sort of prayer to it. It would always be worded about the same and I would get really anxious if I didn‚Äôt do it. This layer evolved into a ritual with clenching my fist, and I‚Äôve been trying to force myself to stop doing that lately. I blame that stupid snowflake for all my issues, yet it still hangs in my room. ### I did this exactly for a very long time. In exact order too ### [deleted] ### Hand washing but I wasn‚Äôt stressed about anything particular that I can remember. My mom had to pry me away from the sink she said. And then after that was counting my brush strokes when I‚Äôd brush my teeth. Not sure why I did that either. It was like my brain was possessed and I couldn‚Äôt not count. :( ### started when i was about 8 and continued till i was 14. I used to have to have my feet off the ground when i turned on lights because i thought my legs would get eaten by the floor and i would die if i didnt lmao ### I‚Äôve been starting to do that recently with doors in general and anything that opens and closes ugh ### This started for me at work places cause many fridges have sticker about ""remember close fridge"" ... 
And before i noticed it was one thing i always chek when im last to leav ### I've always had a thing with doors in general, I feel better when I know things are closed ### Omg stop that‚Äôs crazy!!!!! And it‚Äôs those words ‚Äúhappy healthy safe and alive‚Äù that I just had to say to make sure

Freaking cool we had the same thing ### I came here to literally say this! Still to this day I didn‚Äôt tie the 2 together but wow that makes so much sense. My prayers would never change and if I messed it up I would restart. ### I still do my own version of this. I don't mind praying but going through all the ""necessary"" words can be exhausting. ### I was raised without religion but I ended up picking up prayer for a few years as a kid just as a way to do exactly the same kind of reassurance thing about loved ones, ‚Äújust in case‚Äù god was listening and judging if I didn‚Äôt do it ### I did the same thing. Now I do it with my dog. ### me too ### Did the same with my brother and mom üòÖüò≠ ### me too!! i would hold open his eyes, poor kid ### I woke my mom up 5-10 times a night to make sure she wasnt dead lol. Everyday. Im surprised she didnt kill me at this point lmao ### Family never wants to admit something is wrong (or may even have the same mental illness). ### Lol I used to do this ü§£ sometimes I used to be like hey these adverts were 12 seconds longer than the last set ### Same here!!! ### It was even numbers for me ### I do the same thing. I have to eat a good number of whatever I‚Äôm eating too ### Do you have Tourette‚Äôs? ### Ahh I just remembered that I used to have to say letters, most of the time F, when I was little. I remember there being fear of something bad happening if I didn‚Äôt do it. Ahhh I forgot about that. I didn‚Äôt know it was OCD at the time but now that I‚Äôm looking back it‚Äôs so obvious that was OCD. ### False memory when tried to remember if i locked door or turned something off and i can easily imagine myself leaving door open and turning things on and after that i was soon triple chekking things and now it has even got worse .... all in 2-3 years slow snowballing to this day ### I have these... when I was a kid, i got in trouble all the time because i was ""lying"". In my mind, I really did see those things happen, or do those things. I got in trouble a lot so I just stopped telling people. ### Walking on the right colored squares at school was (and continues to be) a big early one for me. ### Same. My poor mother. 

It died down in my teens but I still deal with shame / guilt OCD quite a bit‚Äîmostly about being ostracized for things I‚Äôve done / said in the past instead of a deity sending me to eternal damnation. The thoughts will pop up here and there and it‚Äôs so hard not to ruminate / compulsively search for answers as a reassurance response. ### Oh same. I remember confessing that I got a big smudge on my dad‚Äôs glass coffee table. ### This is the worst. ### I recently started meds and honestly its so weird to not have something constantly 'running' lol I actually dont know what to do with the silence in my mind ### I have to touch all of the corners in my room because I'm afraid I'll be gravely injured by them. If I miss any corners, I can't sleep. There are a Lot of corners in my room... ### I did and still do have compulsions that stop the world from ending lol as well as my world ugh ### I get what you‚Äôre talking about I do that too ### That‚Äôs called magical thinking actually. I do it too and have since I was about 7. I would play that game ‚Äúhe loves me he loves me not‚Äù dozens of times per day. I was convinced that if I landed on ‚Äúnot‚Äù that someone I lived would die etc. When I went for treatment for OCD my therapist told me it‚Äôs common in kids with OCD and it‚Äôs also why things like astrology can get dangerous for the OCD brain. ### I do that, specifically with colors of eyeshadows. If I have a really bad day, that palate goes in the drawer of misfit shades for awhile until... well until eventually they‚Äôre all in there and I gotta eat shit and pull some back out, anxiety about the whole next week. Hah. I‚Äôve  never admitted that. ### I do that too!!! Oh my gosh, I hate it because I know its just an intrusive thought but it gives me so much anxiety if it ends up the ‚Äúbad‚Äù outcome because what if it‚Äôs true?? Id love to know what it‚Äôs called ### Ceiling tiles, light fixtures‚Ä¶ ### You unlocked a memory I forgot I had: of handing to take deep breaths until it did it EXACTLY right. Over and over again. ### Holy fuck I thought I was the only one who did the blinking hard crap! ### THIIIIIS ### I do the stutter steps lol ### omg I do this! ### Crazy how some of us have the same exact compulsion ### That could be related to PTSD as well if you haven‚Äôt already considered that option. I have C-PTSD in addition to OCD and I feel like that description is common with how PTSD flashbacks manifest. ### I do this at my job and people just see me rechecking stuff not knowing what‚Äôs going on lol ### Hey I still do that one ### I have this, ugh. Mine happens really bad with song lyrics, but only one section of the song over and over and over. I also blurt out random things repeatedly until it feels ""right"". ### Oh the numbers thing lol. Honestly my biggest motivation to learn math in 1st grade. I would always try to find correlations between the digits of 2+ digit numbers. (Like, in xzy x=z/y) ### I do that now lol ### I did this a lot, especially around smokers and car exhaust. ### [removed] ### to add on: only listening to choruses of my favorite songs when i was going down a long hill on my bike and rewinding the song when i was going down a hill. if the chorus didn't feel right whilst going down i would be irritable. ### I agree big time ### #THIS# ### Oh my god, yes. Sitting in a chair heated by someone else‚Äôs body warmth? No. Too soon. ### If you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please do not hesitate to talk to someone.

One of my classmates actually told our teacher that my ears were bleeding and I got so upset and embarrassed because I was doing it to myself and I didn‚Äôt want to cause a scene or have anyone notice because I didn‚Äôt see it as a big deal. 

There was also a time I picked the skin off the back of my head till I bled ### For the longest time and even now instead of saying bye I say ‚Äúsee you‚Äù because that implies that I definitely will see them again. I also can‚Äôt have the last thing I say to a person be ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù because I feel they will die if I say that or ‚Äúbye‚Äù hence ‚Äúsee you‚Äù ### I have to tell my son ‚Äúsee you in the morning‚Äù because otherwise I will die in my sleep ### I didn‚Äôt look into mirrors for the longest time lol ### Oh yeah another thing I remember is making sure all of my cuddly toys were comfortable, I was scared they would be upset with me and hurt me in my sleep even though I knew this was impossible. I felt like I had to give them all equal treatment and love lol ### [removed] ### If you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please do not hesitate to talk to someone.

At least you're not alone im here  opening doors with you üòÇ ### I had it too, along with praying for the next day to be a good one cause I was terrified of something bad happening. I didnt realise it was part of the ocd until I went to therapy and saw it was a listed tendancy ### This is crazy! I would pray too and if I forgot to mention someone I‚Äôd do another prayer because I figured if I didn‚Äôt pray for them and something bad happened it would be my fault. ### It is pretty cool lol ### So exhausting and time consuming ### Wow me too.. I guess it is a common thing with us to assume that someone can just randomly die out of the blue and we have to check just in case. lol this is such a weird feeling for me right now being able to relate with other people over this oddly specific thing.. ### sometimes i still do it with my budgie and peek under his night cover üòÇ ### I started doing it to my folks but they put a stop to that real quick after it kept freaking them out to have me looming over the bed, and I don‚Äôt blame them lol ### Odds for me, and preferably prime numbers. ### Same, even numbers when I was a kid. Specifically the number 5 now that I‚Äôm grown up ### I don't think you 'feel' like saying things with tourettes, its more of a sudden uncontrollable thing. You can get tourettes-like symptoms with a lot of different disorders. For example I have autism and I have echolalia which is where you repeat words or sounds, for me its for sensory stimulation. My sister had echolalia so intensely that my mum thought she might have tourettes lol ### Yeah

I could control it, but it felt wrong if I didn't say it, I might want to look in to echolalia though ### THANK YOU SOMEONE GETS IT! ### Yes totally, it is hard to explain so I‚Äôm glad that made sense lol. And I feel you, I went to 8 therapists before finding my OCD one. I feel lucky cause she was so helpful and helped me to label a lot of stuff which in turn has helped me compulse less. 

And the astrology thing i mentioned was more about how people with OCD can start to think the predictions or whatever are real. It seems fun as a hobby or general interest though! ### Oh I do that to I didnt even know that It was a symptom shit ### Foreal it‚Äôs a perfect way to describe it ### Of course, it‚Äôs best not to diagnose without the help of someone much more qualified and neutral.

my issue w therapists is that besides ocd i also have so many other mental health issues (panic disorder, health anxiety, and ok those and ocd can be dealt w by someone who specializes in anxiety but then i also have body dysmorphic disorder and bpd but i rly think it‚Äôs cptsd or possibly misdiagnosed autism) so i‚Äôd need like..a handful of specialists lmao it‚Äôs impossible to find one equipped to handle all my needs :( and the specialists to begin with aren‚Äôt covered by insurance at least where i‚Äôm at, only the general talk therapists which doesnt help me at all. 

but yeah totally, having a label for what i‚Äôm doing and why would help things make sense and then help demystify it, making it less powerful. it makes total sense ### I do it either 1,3,4,8,16‚Ä¶etc times 

And within those numbers it depends which one feels right. If one doesn‚Äôt feel like enough then I go to 3 and if that doesn‚Äôt feel right then I go to 4 then 8 then 16 and so on ### ",290,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tenqdf/what_is_the_first_ocd_symptom_you_can_remember/
tfolny,"Any Advice On This? Please i need a little help Hello, i'm sorry if this seems like relying on this subreddit but i assure you it's not. I just can't decide what to do in this situation because i feel desperate in this situation i'll be telling you.

My grandmother watches several things on tv everyday and they change very often. When i go to kitchen, i sometimes come across with her shows that i hate because they trigger me a lot. Today i felt very angry about it, they were literally saying the words ''murder, corpse'' on television about a real case they are trying to solve. The people are awful at there, i've heard very disgusting things before and it stresses me so much that i want to punch that fucking television. This is a crime if you ask me, why the fuck you air something this disturbing content(?!) on a tv channel. I'm sick of this, so my grandma but when i talked to her i couldn't say then stop watching it, because i felt upset to imagine that. She has a few activities to do daily and this is one of them, the channels mainly stream these nonsense stuff in early hours of day, when most of the people are working and i can't tell her to stop doing this for a quarter of a day. I know i can tell her that she can avoid these channels but really, there aren't anything other than those channels in my country (there are lots of but you wouldn't pick to watch). The best option would be me not being triggered by them but it's impossible :/

I don't know what to do or say, do any one of you have an idea? Please share with me, i need them very much. Thank you.",3,2022-03-16 14:24:27-04:00,"Do you think maybe you can come up with another activity to keep her busy. Maybe you can go outside or build some puzzles together. You can paint, color, I mean really anything to keep her busy and not watching the shows that trigger you. And that will also be helpful to you to keep your mind occupied. ### I sadly can't spend time with her, i'm preparing for my graduation and i have to take an important exam :( She occupies herself pretty much though, goes out every day and does many things at home, i don't think she gets bored much. But the thing is she wants to watch something during those hours and can't find much content on channels. I'm considering having a streaming platform to switch her watching habits but she wouldn't have interest in today's series, movies etc. Documentaries are good but i think they become boring at some point, by boring i mean person wants another thing to watch you know. I told this to my mother but we couldn't find anything other than solving this on me. But who likes those disturbing things let alone myself. Nobody would want to hear them in the house. I can't stand to it with ocd but i'd avoid if it wasn't with me either.

I'm actually pretty occupied with my thoughts, dreams and things all the time. The thing is, these triggering things keep me away from them when i stumble upon one. It's really distracting and disturbing that i can't keep going on. Really unpleasant story :/ ### That‚Äôs probably your best option if there‚Äôs not much on tv. You can suggest cooking shows, or those remodeling homes shows.

tfnv1t,"Fear of rabies and everyone dying to it. I simply can't get my head off of an intrusive thought that kept me for 6 days straight. I was able to ignore it but not eliminate it.

Basically, I just looked at a dog from the car and now I'm worried that just because I looked at the dog, the dog became provoked and scratched/bitten the door. At first, I thought it was my side but then, I looked at the rear door handle and I saw a few scratches. I haven't looked at scratches before that. I have never heard any noise of a dog or an impact/scratch/bite, and I wasn't wearing headphones, also I wasn't alone so my dad would have noticed it if it was really there but the fear of EVERYONE in my family, not just me, dying to rabies is the worst.

I looked up some car door handle scratches and it seems like your fingernails may cause it, or some weather conditions but it was ONLY on that particular side and the scratches were deep enough to make me think about a rabid dog bite. (Rabid because it would be an unprovoked bite, a sing of the disease) I have never seen an actual bite mark though and I haven't even seen the dog coming to the car.

tfhw7p,What's the general consensus of this sub on the TV show Monk? Like the title says.  Just curious what other people with OCD,3,2022-03-16 09:39:11-04:00,"I remember liking the show when I saw it on tv years ago.

Funny thing is, I'd see what he and his brother went through and think ""I wish I wouldn't be/end up like that.""  I'd repeat that type of phrasing over and over in my head until the show was over and for the next 30 mins.  I didn't believe I was like Monk, but worried I could ""catch"" his problems.

I was diagnosed with OCD 10+ years later. ### My main themes are harm, moral scrupulosity, and just right. So, I only vaguely related to some of the mental gyrations. It never occurred to me that I have OCD until I heard Maria Bamford talking about harm OCD and started learning about other types of OCD that I started to suspect. From a practical standpoint of producing a show, mental compulsions would be tricky to portray without a ton of narrator voice-over, and just seeing the effects would be hard to understand unless you have it yourself. Professor T is another, similar show to Monk that still focuses on contamination and order and symmetry, but makes some effort to portray the mental processes, like him having dialogs with imaginary characters, which I found more relatable. ### God it's so funny you say that because the same thing happened to me! Not with Monk, but with this nice girl I met at the psych hospital when I was young and became fast friends with, and the doctor (in what was a wild breech of ethics) told me 'don't try to be her friend, she won't be able to handle it because of her OCD.' (She had told me she had OCD, but the doctor didn't know that and outed her which was... not cool.) And I remember being like 'huh, why's that?' and the doc telling me 'just be glad you don't have OCD because if you did it'd ruin your life even worse than it is now.'

For years I was so glad I didn't have OCD, because **that** would suck, (I would say to myself, while obsessively googling every trigger on earth, or being paralyzed on the bathroom floor with terror at intrusive thoughts, or locking and relocking my doors over and over. Thank God I don't have OCD, I just have 'whatever this is.' Any time any subsequent doctor or fellow OCD sufferer would tell me they thought I might have OCD I would obsessively cling to the memory from like 10+ years ago of how I didn't have it because one doctor missed it in the diagnosis.)

Fast forward just over a decade and it's like 'oh... damn.' OCD been here the whole time. ### ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tfhw7p/whats_the_general_consensus_of_this_sub_on_the_tv/
tf1ovd,"Difficulty trusting yourself? I'm wondering if this is related to my OCD, but im finding a lot of the time that I don't trust myself to make decisions.  Even simple things like deciding what groceries to buy,  my mind gets paralyzed by indecision and I feel like whatever I choose is wrong.  


An example happened today --- I woke up feeling awful, had undeniable symptoms, yet was extremely hesitant to call out of work.  I was in pain and yet I kept thinking ""what if you're making this up?"" Even though i have no reason to do that,  I don't wanna use up my sick time. It's making me feel crazy,  almost like I'm gaslighting myself? 


Does this happen to y'all?",15,2022-03-15 18:05:34-04:00,"I feel this way all the time ! It‚Äôs so difficult to trust your own brain when you have a mental disorder that gaslights you. ### So, I don't ""trust"" my eyes.  For example, when I go to bed, I have to physically touch and wiggle the knobs on the stove burner to make sure they are off, touch and pull on the door to make sure it is locked and fully closed and touch my dog???? To make sure he is really inside.  It's highly annoying and super stupid when I have visible evidence but I have to have tactile evidence or it isn't ""real"" ### I definitely struggle with this.  To cope, I usually go with my initial feeling and then try to not reflect too much because that‚Äôs when it gets bad for me.  In reality, 80-90% of decisions just don‚Äôt matter and either choice is fine.

tfe6mf,"Contamination OCD - what is normal and what isnt? Hi everyone. I lately developed contamination OCD, unfortunately. 

Since then, I wash my hands a lot and I wonder when is it appropriate to wash your hands? I know it is when 

\- coming back home

\- after the toilet 

\- after touching rubbish/trash

\- after touching pets

\- before cooking and eating 

\- after touching something dirty, e.g. dirty laundry

&#x200B;

However, I also wash my hands many more times. I wash them after touching my nose, even from the outside because I'm scared something is left on there. I wash it after bringing the laundry down the basement (because I have to go down and open door handles). I have to wash my hands even after touching my butt through my clothes :/ Or when touching my face.

I also wash them in the shower when I clean my private area and before touching anything else. I wash them several times during cleaning as well... I don't know. Is that excessive?",5,2022-03-16 06:05:41-04:00,"It is excessive and I do all of the same stuff. I often even wear gloves in my own home and car because it's just too exhausting having to wash my hands all the time. It's not at all about a fear of getting sick for me. It's just that stuff is nasty. For me it's people and bodily fluids/substances. I can't stand feeling like someone else's ""stuff"" is on me. For example, someone in front of me in line hands the cashier money out of their back pocket so now the cashier touched something that person has been sitting on all day, probably sweating through their clothing and farting on and the the cashier has to touch my items to ring them up. Disgusting. That's usually avoidable with self checkout now but there are lots of other similar situations that aren't. I can't have anyone over my house and pretty much any time I see anyone I feel like I need to thoroughly shower as soon as I get home. It's to the point where I just don't really see anyone anymore except my parents since it doesn't bother me with them but it's ruined like 90% of the things I own I can't even use or enjoy anymore because they feel gross. ### I consider myself 'normal' with this theme and I like your first list..I think that's reasonable and typically anything beyond that I think is excessive. For me, after the toilet and before/while I prepare food & eat are the only times really, besides after handling the trash roughly once per day. Here's how I 'normalize' my thinking:

a) most everyday germs aren't very risky to us and our immune system. I don't think about it much, or my hands, outside of a predictable routine at specific points in the day.

b) if I can't see any actual grease or dirt etc. directly, then the main reason to wash is only after handling probable sources of contamination, such as raw meat packaging & why I would automatically do so after using the toilet. 

c) an unclean environment with unclean sources does not equal contamination--if actual contamination happens at all, it passes through stages and not automatically or all at once--(being on your body is not a great idea but not directly dangerous).

d) the main risk to the person is directly through ingestion, which is why I would automatically wash my hands before preparing & consuming anything. 

Track record: maybe I have a good immune system but this has served me fine for over a decade. Your theme is recent so this is really the time to beat it! Good luck. ### I have contamination ocd and to me the bullet points are not excessive as long as you just wash your hands once and not two or three time like I do bc it‚Äôs just basic hand hygiene imo. I do all those and the shower thing as well. I also struggled with knowing if I was being excessive but I feel those are all normal things to wash your hands for but I think most ppl just lack hand hygiene. Ppl will probably disagree but whatever lol 

What is excessive is if you touch your face, nose, your butt through your clothes‚Ä¶and feel the need to wash your hands repetitively. Or if you‚Äôre disinfecting things that don‚Äôt really need to.

Yes, I often have to wash again if I touch parts of the sink. I sometimes disinfect everything I think I touched with ""dirty"" hands (they usually arent bc I wash a lot inbetween but I think I touched the sink = there is pee on my hands). I disinfect my shower gel sometimes. I sometimes feel disinfecting isn't enough either - so I might disinfect and then wash my hands (although I told myself that disinfecting is enough)...

tfkb2y,"Types of OCD Idk if this is normal or has happened to anyone, but I noticed my OCD changes a lot.

In high school I was in a bad relationship and would convince myself I did things that I didn‚Äôt do and confess them to my partner.

tfd1oh,"i can't find explanations anymore I posted a lot of coincidences which happened to me before. Today another one happened and it somehow made me believe that maybe there is dark energy with me like bad spirit and it controls my life. I was just sitting in my room and sudden thought come to my mind. It was like if now i will go to kitchen(my mother was preparing a meal) the first thing she ask me will be x. I tried to distracylt myself thinking how stupid this idea is. Then another thought come if you will be able to ask it your mom before she ask you you can prevent this y(intrusive thought). In order to shut up my ocd i decided to go to kitchen and ask this to my mom and finish this theme. As soon as i reached kitchen my mom asked me that question. Wow how can it be happen? After all these coincidences it didn't hit me much. Maybe my brain just predicted that my mother will ask mr that after all this years together. But it was unpredictable question that she asked me. Okay she asked me that is okay but why the first thing she asked me was that even i didn't enter the kitchen completely. She saw me on the carridor and asked ""can you close..."" now im thinking about maybe there is a spirit,     a being  with me and controls my ideas. Put ideas in my head and then to my mom.

Mundane explanation, you for whatever reason are hyper aware of your surroundings, and your subconscious processes faster than your conscious mind. So it processes things just fast enough that it kind of echos in your head causing a sense of deja Vu. You could also be noticing people's habits. Most people are habitual in their routines doing things in a very similar order every time they do them. 
The more esoteric possibility is you are on a spiritual wavelength that picks up messages from the Universe. Which shouldn't be scary, but since it's new and not something experienced by everyone can feel scary particularly if those around you tell you you're odd for what you're experiencing.

This part is in response to your post in r/occult. Sorry for posting in a different thread, but that thread was locked for some reason. There are a few things that could be occurring. The answer you'll probably get the most is that you're having an issue mentally and should seek professional help. I can't say that's not what is happening, particularly if your taking medications for OCD. If you feel that's the case talk with your doctor about maybe changing the dose or trying something different. If you're afraid to share the exact reasons with your doctor, which is understandable you can describe it as dark spots in your vision which sounds much better than I'm seeing shadows moving around.
The next possibility is that it's just stress induced, which could be helped with exercise and meditation. 
Does anyone else in your house notice odd occurrences? If it's not just you, it could be of a more spiritual nature. Which doesn't necessarily mean it's bad, the ways that entities get your attention can be very similar regardless of whether they are good or not, and because it's out of the norm it's scary which makes us think of it as sinister. You mentioned that you were not feeling good about yourself. This can tarnish even the attempts of good beings trying to help you. 
So this should help whether it's spiritual or psychological. Work on filling yourself and your space with love. Start and end your day by telling everyone you care about that you love them. When you do it for yourself try looking in a mirror and smiling. You can also tell your shadows that you love them. You may want to do so quietly if nobody else in the house sees anything, because to many people randomly saying I love you to the air is odd. This may seem silly particularly if you're younger. If the issue is with your mental health, building up your self esteem and self love will help reduce stress and help you to be happier. If the issue is with spirits, unless invited spirits tend to have trouble staying in places outside of their spheres of influence. So spirits of malicious and negative natures are uncomfortable and have to expend extra effort to stay in spaces filled with positive energy like love. 
This is just a blanket response to what you posted about. It's in no way a guarantee, I am not a trained professional, I have had experiences with mental episodes and spiritual encounters and am only speaking from my general experience. Reaching out to someone you trust can be very helpful. I recommend doing your own research on both mental and spiritual aspects. The internet is not necessarily the best place to find information so it's good to double check.
If you feel like your a danger to yourself or another talk with a professional ASAP.
Take care and be well! ### Thank u so much<3 ### Thank u so much for your time and response. I will try what you said and no i don't take any medications i used to take but it was a year ago. Your advices are very well and make me feel good. Again, thank u‚ù§ ### No worries. I'd recommend finding someone you can trust IRL to talk things through with, but I know it can be hard and scary to not only find someone open-minded but to open up to them about something out of the ordinary. If that winds up being the case, and you'd like to talk about these experiences you can send me a message. I can't say the spiritual aspects of the world are true, I believe in them and found my truths during times of extreme mental troubles. So I have some understanding of both sides. If you're questioning the authenticity of your experiences test them scientifically. If you truly believe that what your experiencing is something of a esoteric nature, let the universe or the spirits know you're going to test things scientifically. If it's a malicious or negative entity things will likely shift completely out of the pattern you'd been experiencing, in a manner that will cause confusion, fear and doubt. If the entities are benign you should be able to reproduce the results(this may not hold accurate if your trying to reproduce the results to show someone, sometimes it may work and sometimes not. I think it more depends on if the person your showing is ready to experience it). If you feel threatened by an entity, pray, do protection circles whatever you believe and to who you believe can help. If you need to talk with a mental health professional, or some other form of counseling. If you're worried they'll think you're crazy for believing in spirits just talk about the stuff that's unrelated, and try and find someone that does believe, to talk to about the other aspects. Don't let your physical and mental well being fall into too bad of disarray. As I stated previously, if your personal well being is in shambles even positive spiritual encounters can be tarnished and will seem scary and confusing.  If you don't love yourself you won't be open to the Universes love. Healing and growth can be an up and down process so don't hold your good days against your bad days. You'll have different levels of energy and mental fortitude on each. ### You're great.

I've had a lot of problems thanks to Pure-O.  I started getting very negative about everything in life and it'd made living that much harder.  

Is it similar for you? ### Have you had ERP? How much, who with, etc.? ### It's been 15 years. It's just not possible for me to live a happy life. ### Pretty much ### He already said in his post , he's had this disabling condition for over 15 years. Treatment doesn't work for everyone.

Some people including myself just live a miserable existence till the end of death. That's life ### [deleted] ### Same over 15 years, and I'm ready to end it. Nothing makes me happy. I have no goals and no relationships ### You have my sincerest sympathies, I know that state all too well.  

That's a very rough position to be in but it absolutely can change.  You're most certainly not stuck like that.  It takes work to dig out of that hell and it feels incredibly unfair at first when you feel drained, especially if it's been years.  Plus, the negativity can get so ingrained.

For me, I had to start cracking down on my own negativity.  I stopped holding my personal opinions as something important, began to not give them much attention.  I forced myself to not label my situation in good or bad terms, it simply is what it is.  Stopped ruminating on how awful things are and thinking it will never change, it won't if I don't think it will.  I set myself up for failure.

Eventually, the discipline paid off and it allowed positivity to come into my life.  I've still got issues, but I have some strength to tackle some of them. ### Yes I read his post, thanks for pointing that out.

That‚Äôs not life. It‚Äôs entirely possible to treat OCD. OP may have things left to try - so it would be good to help him explore that. ### Not technically surgery I guess but ECT.

He's in a terrible hopelessly position just like me and thousands of others. 

Stop spreading the narrative that there's TONS of others things to try. When there isn't, there's no cure and modern medicine/science doesn't even now what fully causes ocd. It's all theory.

We are stuck. He's probably stuck at home just like me, what a fuckin horrible life to live.

Wait untill you lived with ocd for 20 plus years and then come back. Maybe your midnset would change. Keep in mind that not every case is the same ### I haven‚Äôt spread that narrative. I‚Äôve had OCD for over 20 years, I know what treatments are available. OP hasn‚Äôt even said what he‚Äôs had.

Yes it‚Äôs a horrible life, but maybe uplifting OP and trying to help him would be better. Respectfully, I think you‚Äôre now making this post about you and your own experience. ### Yea it's a open discussion forum. We all share our experiences and relate to each other?

I have severe contamination ocd and am completely confined to my room and only the bathroom when I need to shower etc, but I clean it when I use it. It‚Äôs driving me insane as it has lasted for the longest time and any time I tell my parents that my condition is partly his fault for being worse they said I‚Äôm being mean. I just want to be able to cook, and watch tv and do the stupid little things again instead of being on my own constantly even when I leave the house. I can‚Äôt move out yet because I can‚Äôt get a job because of my current state. I also have ptsd from the things my brother has done and i feel SO trapped. Advice?",25,2022-03-15 18:18:14-04:00,"Years???? And he doesn't get ill or ????? ### Is the ptsd from your brother triggering your contamination ocd for so long? Just curious, no need to answer if you're not comfortable.

Do you have a friend you could move in with while you get ready to get a job? Your brother is obviously not going to change anything and it sounds like removing yourself is the best option ### I'm a bit autistic and I can't stand to have BO because I'm sensitive to smells. I had a job for a few years where from time to time I had to fix computers in the office of this woman who smelled like a homeless person and I turned to masking fragrances, like orange works particularly well, imagine a 17th century noble with a scented hanky.

I think it's BS that it sounds like your parents think this is acceptable like they are whimps about setting boundaries and helping him take care of himself. Or that that think this behavior is just normal for autism. If your brother isn't very functional, he may need some teaching like some time in a group home learning life skills or someone to help him bathe on a more regular basis, maybe build it into a routine over time. If he is functional enough to have a coherent conversation, you may need to explain it in terms that he can understand like it's giving you sensory over-stimulation. ### honestly if someone doesnt shower for that long, i hate to say it, but its time to call some kind of authority (does not have to be police) but some kind of entity that can help. mobile crisis units are great. they come by, usually two MH professionals, and calmly assess. then they can make an evaluation and get someone admitted to the hospital. months or years without a shower is more than enough that someone needs another level of help they currently arent receiving. you shouldnt have to live with that. no one should including the person not showering. its doing harm for your own recovery as well. hope you can both find some solutions. ### I know it doesn‚Äôt actually help but have some hearts üíôüíúüíôüíúüíô I have a gross roommate who makes it hard for me to leave my room or use the kitchen. Not near as extreme as your situation but you have my solidarity ### Do you both live with your parents, or are you both roommates? Honestly it would be such a concern to hear that a family member is not washing themselves, let alone their own child. They must believe that because they aren't needing to be around them and see how bad it is -- that it isn't their problem.

That is horrible not feeling comfortable in your own house. 

Does your brother understand how much it bothers you? Does he work? I'm so confused how no one else has said anything to him ### So I‚Äôve read your comments about your brother, and he has some serious problems that are not autism. I have autism as well. Acquiring pictures of underage girls, not showering or brushing teeth and shouting/threatening are not ‚Äúnormal‚Äù things for people with autism. He sounds like he needs serious professional help. Is there anyone you can contact about this? (a professional or a service perhaps?) ### He has gotten sick a few times, but it‚Äôs not often often ### Yeah, my ptsd developed from my brother and then because it wasn‚Äôt dealt with my ocd developed completely surrounding stuff to do with him. I would not be as bothered about contamination if I wasn‚Äôt living with him, I really think I could get better. I‚Äôm trying to find a place to stay but everyone I know still lives with their parents since A levels there‚Äôs not enough time to work enough to rent. Still gonna carry on trying though aha ### He‚Äôs very high functioning. My brother is very smart in a lot of things so I really don‚Äôt understand, he even managed to fix my mums car a few days ago which was very broken simply from his own study. My camhs worker asked about him  going to a specialised home but I know he would never do that because he‚Äôd end up hurting someone or something, it‚Äôs a shame because it would be good if he would just accept some sort of professional help. It‚Äôs torture on me and I‚Äôm really sick of my parents treating me like I‚Äôm selfish ### I would call someone but we had social services around for 7 years so i don‚Äôt know who else. Then they had to come back for evaluation for my safety because my brother has literally acquired *pictures* of underage girls by harassing them online. I don‚Äôt know how they never noticed that he doesn‚Äôt shower, and I don‚Äôt know how they concluded that everything was fine. I feel so yuck ### Thank you:) i hope your situation gets better ### he does know how much it bothers me, but I don‚Äôt think he comprehends why. He thinks everyone who mentions it to him is just being rude. We both live with our parents, im 17. And he doesn‚Äôt work at all, yet he‚Äôs always shouting and threatening my mum when he wants to buy something that he can‚Äôt afford. I have told professionals outside of my family but they said it‚Äôs not considered a safeguarding issue no matter how he acts. I‚Äôm honestly just as confused as to why no one is bothered or cares like I do ### I could but my parents would probably hate me for trying to actually solve the problem because he would just get angry. It‚Äôs so complicated. I‚Äôve thought there was no way this was only autism because having asd doesn‚Äôt make anyone do the extreme things he has. ### Ok but that reaches a point where is unhealthy not just for him but for the rest of the people on the house, how did your family let it reach to that point?
I would try to explain how damaging that is again until they listen if that doesn't work I don't know. ### Does he understand that you feel like the stench is hurting you and causing you stress? He may have some affective empathy rather than cognitive empathy, like if he sees and understands that you are hurting rather than seeming like you're criticizing and trying to start a fight when you're frustrated. I'd recommend reading some books on autism if you haven't like Temple Grandin and John Elder Robison, that's the kind of level that I'm at related most to Robison's son as described in Raising Cubby. Running with Scissors by his brother Augusten Burroughs might be good, hopefully your home life wasn't quite that insane--just noticed they made that a movie years ago totally missed that. The Mind Tree by Tito Mukhopadhyay is amazing, he's a bit lower functioning, but has an amazing way of explaining from the inside. My hope is this could help you better understand how your brother sees things and maybe that will give you some insight into a way to approach it that might be more successful. ### thats.... alot. look up 'mobile crisis' in your area. see if they can help. ### Jeezus that's even more bizarre that they let him not shower when you're all in the same house. Idk how they can deal with it unless they're noseblind?? I can't wrap my head around why they allow it to happen

He's wrong, it's not rude if a family member tells him to pick up his hygiene. Y'all live in an enclosed space. And it's been months since he showered, that's into the extremes here, he doesn't have any right to complain with how long it's been since he's washed. He would have more of a leg to stand on if a stranger came up to him and say ""you smell like complete ass"" or sprayed Lysol near his air space.

I'm sorry you're having to deal with this. I hope you can get out of that living situation since it sounds like he's not going to leave ### So much has happened that my parents couldn‚Äôt focus on it anymore, my brother is a horrible person and has caused so much harm even despite this that I think they just gave up. I was hospitalised in November partly for this reason and still nothing changed. My psychiatrist doesn‚Äôt even know how to help me. ### He very much does. He knows I was in hospital from living in the house. He‚Äôs heard me have panic attacks etc etc. I could think of reasons why he wouldn‚Äôt shower but not to this extent, and it‚Äôs even stranger because when he very rarely does, he even says he feels better? I don‚Äôt feel bad for him anymore because there are huge chunks of my life that have been made so complicated. My mum offers to take him out or she even made a basket of shower stuff for him that had characters on that he liked and fresh wash cloths etc to make him maybe more comfortable so then he might chose to shower he still refuses, he doesn‚Äôt even brush his teeth. Even the slightest sentence even when he‚Äôs sick and upset from it like ‚Äúmaybe you should have a warm bath you might feel better‚Äù sets him off. He just shouts for so long. Also I‚Äôve read the mind tree! I‚Äôll look into the others too, thank you ### The thing is I get shouted at and end up crying whenever I even mention that it‚Äôs not fair for my recovery to be ruined, and I say it in the nicest way possible because i don‚Äôt want to argue. I think I give up trying to get my parents to care lol. Thanks though, & I hope so too ### Fuck man, I'm sorry I hope you can get out of there soon ### I don't think it's enough for him to be vaguely aware that you have issues there's no cause and effect for him to make a connection from that to his BO, it doesn't sound like he has that much social awareness and would have to be more immediate than that. Googling ""adult autism bathing"" turns up some interesting discussions and results. For some people it is overstimulation and sometimes claustrophobia. A few do it intentionally to keep people at a distance. Kind of funny to see some people generalizing to ""this is just how all we autistic people are, dirty, grimy people"" projecting themselves onto everyone else when that's clearly not true but a lack of self awareness like this discussion https://community.autism.org.uk/f/adults-on-the-autistic-spectrum/11220/having-baths-or-showers ### It's so not fair that 3/4ths of your house believes he's the only person allowed to get upset over anything. And that you should suffer in complete silence since they gave up on parenting. They're accomodating him so much that you're suffering...and they know you are and not doing anything about it. 

I wish you could whip out the garden hose and powerwash the filth right off of his mean mug ### Yeah I thought it would be either sensory issues or to actually keep people away. But he does know, my mum has explained it to him directly. He stays in his room and asks when I‚Äôm outside of mine upstairs because he‚Äôs been told why I would be uncomfortable and he does get it. ### ",15,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tf1yvo/living_with_someone_unhygienic/
tfdbl2,"Possible types of brain surgery for OCD? Hello, 

I have suffered with OCD for over 20 years and I have been on medication for majority of that time period.  One thing that I never thought too much about until recently was the possibility of having some sort of brain surgery to alleviate or possibly get rid of this OCD altogether.  Recently, I ran across something called Bilateral Cingulotomy, which supposedly can help alleviate symptoms of OCD, anxiety, and depression.  Now I know that any type of brain operation comes with great risks, but I am just curious if anyone here has ever had one done or even considered it?

Thanks ahead of time for your responses",1,2022-03-16 05:05:18-04:00,"I would look into ketamine, psychedelics first if you haven't already. Surgery is going to be the last step.

tf7umk,"help, I'm scared of losing my mind I just want to start out by saying, this is my first post and if you do intend to read it, thank you. Also it's gonna be a long one too. I want to start off when I was in 7th grade, just moved to a different state and I became a hypochondriac. It was very difficult for me and ny family. I felt like a burden, and we were poor too. Years later ( in 2016 or 2017), I still dealt with hypochondria but not to a certain extent, just general anxiety. And mind you I was never like this before I moved. I'm in my sophomore year of higshhcool. I smoked for the first time, it wasn't weed but ""dab"" a higher concentrated thc. It was first time too and Idk why I thought it was a good idea. I didn't feel good, I was told I was meant to feel good. It was horrible. I thought I was gonna die, my vision was distorted and I felt so detached and eventually everything looked so weird. I felt like a floating pair of eye balls, I was confused and I felt like I couldn't breathe. I had thoughts of like oh no I did something and and the cops are gonna arrest me, it never gotten crazier than that, if I remember correctly. Some kind of life crisis thinking and stuff. My nerves were in shock and if you know what sitting on the toilet while your legs fall asleep, I felt that through out my body, I was also emotionally numb. I couldn't feel my tongue etc...

I wanted to die at that time. It soon wear off after 2 hours. I woke up the next day, I felt normal, like my old self. Then 2 weeks late I got into my buddies truck again where it started to happen. Stoughton up ptsd, I didn't tell him, I just had the visual effects though. I got home and I shrugged it off. I got into the car with my mom and everything started to look weird. I was back in it. Not as hard but it still fucked me up. I couldn't go to school. Lost 30 pounds in a week. I felt like I was going crazy. I found out it was drug induced realization and depersonalization. I found out what if was and soon started to recover. I became better than ever. I ""cured"" myself but just accepting it and stuff. The reason I'm telling you this is because it may tie into what I share next. 

Although I cured myself I still have some anxiety and it still remained for a bit but most times I don't notice it. But I've been neglecting my healthiness by having a bad sleeping schedule, eating fast food. Just bad shit to be honest. I would have ocd thoughts like, what if I run these kid over or like dumb shit like this protein bar has LSD, I  didn't believe these thoughts but it's more like I was always like brain don't say anything dumb or stupid. But my brain goes what if this or that. 

I got my cholesterol check because my dad told me too and to get fit. I was having some bad heart anxiety which really fucked me up to where I changed litterlly almost everything about me, I change my diet, walked everyday, sleep early and woke uo early. My hypnagognic hallucinations was gone. I was the happiest I been in awhile. 

Now this is where I'm currently stuck at. I got covid and everything got messed up. Litterly everything. My anxiety got back and after I healed I tried to start being healthy again but it was hard. Some of my addiction came back, like porn. 2 weeks after my healing process. I started to have short term memory loss, less focus and more distracted. My stutter got worse . It felted like I was walking on a boat sometimes. I went to the doc and she agreed that it is probably post covid brain fog. But again my hypochondria is always there now and more fierce than ever. I was anxious that I started to see some of hynagogic hallucinations while in the daytime, but they were always fast and went away. I started to see like, I would pan over something real quick and it looked like a person but it was a mailbox, or like I thought I saw something sitting down with a blue shirt or something but I quickly looked back and it was a blue chair.  This actually got better since i started to see of it . I started to see like black dots, and mostly in my corner would dash across my vision super fast or something like dark stuff in my corner of my eyes. I'm so anxious right now because I'm scared of losing my mind and going shcizo, or some kind of other psychosis.

I would hear sound start would almost like something familiar, but i knew it wasn't. I started to doubt things again, like did I actually  hear that, or always checking up on myself. All the sound. Did I actually see that....etc.... I was so obsessed if what I was actually hearing were real birds chirping or not, I got so into it that I actually started to hear bird chirping, or some kind of high pitch in the background 24/7 and this started yesterday. Well not 24/7 but usually when I'm more conscious of it ish. These sound super distant though too. I got home and I didn't hear it as ""loud"" as I did at store that I work at.

It's 3/15/2022

I wanted to get better and started to drink better, eat better, sleep better, but I started to feel more stressed out and pain .

I'm so obsessed over losing my mind any second or start to hear voices. 

I litterly don't hear voices telling me to do stuff, or harm anybody. I'm just so scared.

tf9v2v,"Constantly feeling guilty Hi guys

I‚Äôve had pretty bad anxiety problems for the last 10 years
I feel like I‚Äôve gotten to a good, manageable level thanks to the latest psychologist I‚Äôve been seeing for the last 3 years

But it‚Äôs like my brain constantly needs to find something to worry about because now I constantly feel like I‚Äôm cheating on my partner and feeling guilty about it until I get reassurance from my girlfriend or psychologist that I‚Äôm not.

An example is. If I don‚Äôt hold my breath or breath out while walking past a woman, I feel like I‚Äôm cheating by breathing in their smell (this also happens with people on tv so I don‚Äôt even know how this is an issue in my brain but it is)

I was sitting next to my girlfriend on the couch the other day with her grandma and family. 
Her grandma crossed her legs and I breathed in and now I‚Äôve been feeling extremely guilty like I might have tried to smell her vagina.
I am not attracted to her, i would never cheat on my girlfriend but I can‚Äôt help but think I did it on purpose.
My brain doesn‚Äôt remember the exact scenario either so I can‚Äôt confirm or deny if I did it on purpose or not.

I‚Äôve explained all this to my psychologist and she doesn‚Äôt think I‚Äôve done anything wrong but I can‚Äôt get rid of the guilty feeling.
My girlfriend is aware that I feel guilty about stupid things all the time but I really don‚Äôt want to keep putting all this stuff on her. She‚Äôs so supportive about everything but it feels wrong telling her these weird guilt problems constantly (even though I know it‚Äôll make me feel better instantly)

There are many other examples, like not wearing certain clothes I own that an ex may have worn, even though they‚Äôve been washed.
And constantly washing my hands if I think a woman has touched something that I then touch.
I feel like I‚Äôm making some progress slowly with some of these things and I understand that seeking reassurance isn‚Äôt a long term fix

I just feel so shit all the time. I would actually prefer just feeling anxious/dread all day than have this feeling of guilt.

If anyone has any answers, please let me know

Thanks heaps",8,2022-03-16 01:05:03-04:00,"I just want to say that you‚Äôre definitely a good partner, I can tell by just reading this that you‚Äôve already had the ‚ÄúCheating Conversation‚Äù in your head. 

You see, you‚Äôre overthinking the whole boundaries thing and assuming that you want these thoughts in your head. You‚Äôre over analyzing your situation and thinking that you‚Äôre committing some form of infidelity on your partner and you‚Äôre not.

You have to breathe, you need oxygen. There‚Äôs going to be times where you inhale around your girlfriend or her friends, family etcetera and that‚Äôs just the inevitability of that situation.

You‚Äôre a person of high principles due to your OCD and that‚Äôs what makes you feel unique to others, you feel like you should hold yourself to a higher standard because you feel like you must, not because you want to.

You‚Äôre a good person and I hope this helped!

I think this was partly made worse, due to long ago when I dated someone who would always, always, 'help' with such compulsions, even in public, kinda.",0,2022-03-15 22:09:58-04:00,,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tf6quu/how_do_you_deal_with_sexual_compulsion_ocd/
texexp,"How can someone with debilitating mental illness be expected to make a living? I'm barely getting by from some savings left from unemployment during the pandemic when that was actually paying a significant amount and a lot of help from my parents. So i feel like a fucking loser. I have an associate's in engineering and cant even use it. Mental illness is for the most part not recognized as a real disability unless it's something like alzheimer's or mental retardation. 

But getting disability income for something like OCD, depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, etc.? Good fucking luck. Even if you do manage to, the maximum you can expect is about $1000/month, less than half of what is necessary to pay for basic needs. That wouldn't even cover rent for most people. I'm not personally at a level of severity anymore where I can't work at all, but I cannot hold down a full time job. The longest I've ever managed to do that was less than a year.

 I'm 30 and have had ocd since my late teens. Even if the job itself isn't super triggering for my ocd, I'm just too fucking exhausted from constantly dealing with it 24/7, along with depression and anxiety. I could probably manage 20 hrs/week at some low-stress job but most part time jobs aren't going to pay more than about 15/hr, which works out to about 1000/month at 20 hrs per week after taxes. I could live with that IF I could supplement that with another 1000 from disability income. But it doesn't work like that. Getting SSDI (disability income) means you can't work AT ALL. So basically the way the government sees it is either you're perfectly capable of working full time or you aren't capable of working at all and the best you can hope for is living in poverty on 1000/month. Maybe some people could make that work with a couple roommates or something, but often that's not even an option BECAUSE of the mental illness. I couldn't stand having roommates because of my contamination ocd. So the fuck am I supposed to do?",2,2022-03-15 15:18:35-04:00,"I feel for you.  Working 40 hours a week is absolute garbage for my mental health,  im exhausted all the fucking time,  and I still don't make enough money to get my own place because of inflation.

Many people take their own life because society thinks shitty disabled people it‚Äôs their fault they are disabled. It‚Äôs so bad. It‚Äôs so so so bad.

tfbquk,"Why can I ‚Äúhear‚Äù visual (technically soundless) motion? I don‚Äôt know if I am going to explain this in any way that makes sense, but I am wondering why I hear a sound in my brain whenever there‚Äôs motion that is technically soundless. 

Usually, this happens when I see the motion. For example, a gif that has no sound to it, for some reason there‚Äôs sound to the movement of the gif when I see it. This gets really annoying if the gif is something that moves fast/is repetitive in a fast pace.

This also sometimes happens when I can‚Äôt see the moving thing, but I know that it‚Äôs moving. For example, if I am laying on my stomach and moving my legs behind me, sound will be applied to that as well. But I don‚Äôt know if that instance is the same thing, or if I‚Äôm making that happen.

Also, I have OCD (diagnosed by a professional) so I‚Äôm unsure if it could be that or not. It could make sense for it to be, considering a majority of my obsessions/compulsions occur in my head ie. obsessive thoughts, intrusive thoughts, repetitive thoughts. All that fun shit. 

Anyways, I‚Äôve asked people if the above mentioned thing happens to them with things like soundless videos, gifs and the like, but everybody that I‚Äôve asked has told me no and then has given me an odd look.

For context my brain won‚Äôt let me walk on this one side of the road because the can lid is there. The can lid if I don‚Äôt step over causes me to have the worst day ever and if it‚Äôs moved it‚Äôs bad. I know it‚Äôs not logical but that‚Äôs what my OCD thinks lol. Anyway it snowed so I couldn‚Äôt walk that way and then I have been avoiding it since. So today I walked on that side of the road but didn‚Äôt look at the ground instead I looked at the sky and stared at cars passing by. I continued my breathing and made it through! I‚Äôm so glad you did it too! You showed OCD and told it we are strong! We can do this! One step at a time! You are amazing! ### even though i know the compulsions dont worki still have to do them i tried killing myself multiple times today my fears are extremly strong so is my paranoia it just gets worse for me.... ### Good job! ### Excellent.  We're proud of this and future progress you have. ### That's great to hear ### you deserve a treat. literally just do the thing thats your very favorite thing. ### Outstanding üëè üëè üëè ### If ya don't mind, what's your compulsion? ### Oh I can definitely feel that. I used to walk away from trash cans or if I was with someone, a friend or something - who cares about me - they‚Äôd walk closer to the bin. It‚Äôs a rough ride!

Congratulations to you!! Proud of you, friend!! Keep doing the same thing, eventually it‚Äôll get better and move onto the next obsession & compulsion :)

 Cheers!! :) ### I‚Äôm sorry to hear that. Truthfully, I‚Äôve been there. It can get better, it‚Äôs a huge struggle though. I‚Äôve lost everything to OCD, my entire life at one point. To the point where my family pretty much exiled me.

Things will get better, friend. If you ever need to talk, please don‚Äôt hesitate to dm me.

Not all doctors care. But some do. Try and find a professional and weed them out if they‚Äôre not good. :) ### Thank you :) ### Thank you! I appreciate the support :) ### Thank you, I appreciate the support ! :) cheers! ### ^_^ yeah I try and reward myself with positive reinforcement because then it encourages me to keep fighting. Cheers! :) ### Thank you! The anxiety was killing me for hours but I fought it. :) ### Not at all! It‚Äôs a lot of stuff. But hand washing, showering, hoarding, a lot of contamination stuff. ### Thank you! You keep going strong too! Gotta break those compulsions before they form! I learned that if I‚Äôm quick enough they will not form like sometimes I will fixate on not stepping on a crack and then go why let a new obsession form. So I step on the crack or walk funny just to show it I won‚Äôt let it control me lol ### Your welcome ### It will get easier and easier! ### Mine is sending messages to people I should not and try to change them. Like, people that insult them and try to make them become better persons. I even was deemed a harasser and people threatened to call the cops it's horrible. Should I do what it says and message these people or just sit with the bad feelings? ### Yes!! I‚Äôve felt that, too. Once something starts, you got to either try your best to stop it, or it‚Äôll try and  take over. Be strong! Feel free to pm me if you‚Äôre ever struggling, chances are I‚Äôll be struggling, too. Hoping life gets better though, but I‚Äôve went from having a safe zone in my bed (literally not even the bedroom, just the bed) to actually going out and being able to do a little bit. ### That‚Äôs great and the pandemic has honestly sucked. Especially for my OCD I hate germs and have a problem with washing my hands too much. And now hand sanitizer is too easy to get my hands on lol. But on the bright side I have a little sister who loves to steal my water or food so that stops food and drinks from being a huge deal as long as hands are washed. Like if my friend offer me a chip I won‚Äôt take it unless her hands were washed right then. Sure is annoying! How are you doing though you matter too!:) ### The pandemic has been super rough, cause there are a few anti-maskers, I haven‚Äôt really used hand sanitizer but I wear gloves outside everywhere.

I have a certain soap I use - so that‚Äôs been rough on my hands during winter but spring is coming so I hope that‚Äôll help because my hands have been dry as hell.

Other than that, I think I‚Äôve been okay. I‚Äôve been like this pre-pandemic (minus the mask) so while it‚Äôs been rough, it‚Äôs been ‚Äúunderstandable‚Äù in my mind (if that makes sense)

temxzu,"For the first time in years i feel confident with dealing with ocd. I now have a deep untouchable understanding of how to deal with ocd that happens automatically every time i get symptoms. I used to think of ocd as a monster that I'm lucky if is not bothering and hopping it won't come back, so it was always a let's hope ocd leaves me alone. Now i don't think like that, my brain is always welcome to tell me about the threats and i will like always respond with irrelevance. It's so simple which makes me a bit upset i didn't do earlier. Dealing with ocd is all about mastering how to act as if your thoughts are irrelevant, while having uncertainty and these catastrophic thoughts be like "" yeah cool i couldn't care less I'll watch tv now"" and go with your day carrying the creative associations with you.
That's what it's all about, showing the brain thru actions ( not words) that these thoughts are irrelevant to you.

tfb9sb,"Doubts during ERP I have contamination OCD of bodily fluids(sexual fluids to be more specific), and this post might be a bit weird or TMI. More than germs, its the disgust that bothers me. So I started ERP all by myself a few months back using the internet, cuz I can't rlly see a therapist rn. I do see improvement, but I get bothered by millions of doubts and thoughts. I'm gonna state a few examples, but most of them are reassurance, and thus I do not want the answer to those. I just want some advice on how I can handle these thoughts.

I get questions like: ""If people wash objects they use for anything sexual, wouldn't you also require to clean the surface you were on, especially if you used it for any such purpose directly(grinding and stuff), with or without clothes? If I don't, wouldn't that make me a disgusting person, cuz even normal people would find it disgusting,wrong and disrespectful?"", ""people without ocd also find these things dirty atleast to some extent and clean it if they contaminated things like me""

i saw a post where peole said its disgusting to anything sexual on the couch, how they'd avoid it and not sit on it, how theyd wash or change the couch, and how theyd be reminded everytime they see it. they said the person who does this especially in communal spaces is disgusting,inconsiderate, etc. they said they wouldnt touch anything in the house of such a person. since exposures involve things thatd make even normal ppl uncomfortable, i feel these exposures are wrong or too far and my ocd is somehow justified, and its wrong to do all this. especially cuz i get used to these exposures and wanna continue them, not as exposures but as something i do out of convenience or preference, which again would make me ignorant and, well, dirty.

once i saw a video by an ocd specialist who said that disgust is something different from the fears of getting sick due to contamination, and is controlled by a different part of the brain, and thus takes longer to get over. if clients dont improve from erp for weeks or months, theyre made to switch to only response prevention and just do the best they can. im not sure how only response prevention works, and since that day ive had this doubt in my mind saying ""its been a few months and i shouldnt be doing erp at all cuz the exposures are wrong and not working, and you'd only hv to practice response prevention. its not working cuz its actually disgusting and thus ur supposed to shift to response prevention, cuz ur disgust is somewhat justified. ur doing exposures, erp and just the overall treatment all wrong.""

i also hv this thing where i hv to ask the smallest of doubts if i start asking anything. it is very bothering but i get scared if my doubt is actually genuine, or what if its not ocd at all. how could i work on it if i never learn to or dont know how to differentiate bw ocd and real rational thoughts, or what if i make a mistake and consider a rational thought as ocd or vice versa and actually do something disgusting or wrong or harmful. i would describe it better but the post is already long enough and im trying not to give in to my ocd of including every little detail while seeking advice.

these are some of the main ones,theres thousands of more but again the post would be longer than it already is if i stated even another one. id appreciate any advice on how to handle these thoughts. again, these r the thoughts seeking reassurance, i dont want any, i want advice on what to do.

Sorry for the extremely long post, things hv just been piling up and i rlly need help.",8,2022-03-16 02:37:48-04:00,"I'm sorry you're struggling so much at the moment. That sounds exhausting tbh.

It‚Äôs a pretty common stage of OCD (especially in teenagers or adults with high sex drive). 

I‚Äôm going to go out on a limb and just ask a question, how does your Contamination OCD affect you? Are you just disgusted by it or are you experiencing anxiety over it?

I'll be seeing a therapist as soon as I can though. ### Thank you for the reply! Its mainly just disgust, and the disgust gives me anxiety. I feel guilty for spreading it around and to others and making everything dirty. Usually I'd clean with soap and water, but that was slowly getting worse so I decided to cut down on the compulsions. ### Okay, are you worried about anything else? Are you scared that if you don‚Äôt clean enough, something might happen? ### Nope, I've never had such a fear, although since I've been doing exposures, my OCD's tried to latch onto absolutely anything it can by even changing fears and themes. I did thus worry about germs to a certain extent, and I'm just scared of being a disgusting, ignorant and dirty person. Especially after I see people without OCD finding it disgusting as well. ### Well, honestly as long as you wash the surfaces directly contaminated you‚Äôre okay. ### But the thing is, if I start doing that, I feel the need to wash everything that touched it cuz it only keeps getting worse.

I‚Äôm not sure what to do as I‚Äôm not managing well, but I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs been getting better for you ### The best you can do is simply accept you made a mistake and learn from it. I know it‚Äôs hard but detach emotion from those events and try to view them and yourself objectively and just take them as learning lessons for the future. Allow yourself to grow. No one on earth has got it all right and treated everyone perfectly. Have compassion and forgive yourself. If you‚Äôre feeling regret it shows you‚Äôve grown as a person and would probably act differently now so don‚Äôt be too hard on yourself.

Also if you think about it, it‚Äôs good we can look at an event or mistake and feel regret bc without feeling it we‚Äôd make the same mistake. We wouldn‚Äôt think about how our actions impacted others. If anything it makes you self aware which is a good thing.

Also when it pops up in your head instead of just regretting and feeling like shit this is exactly the perfect time to simply say in your mind it‚Äôs ok. That‚Äôs not where you stand now and you take the lesson. That‚Äôs it and move on. It‚Äôs so hard at times bc it just randomly pops in your head but keep telling yourself that when it pops in your mind so that you‚Äôre rewiring your thought process. The mind gets used to the same thought loops so you gotta break them. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs helped me. ### My problem is that it's not one mistakes, it's many :(

Today I am talking about POCD. I can't live like this. I can't even look at children without a thought about doing something sexual with them. It makes me question myself so much. About being a pedophile and I have to reassure myself that I'm not, that it's my OCD, but my OCD seems to be winning in making me feel shame and feel like I am a pedophile.

I just want to die. I want to erase myself from this world but I'm scared of going through with it. Not the actual thought of dying or doing it that scares me. The thought of what comes after you die is what's scary because whatever that is, that's all you will see for the rest of eternity. 

I have these thoughts about my two nieces and family friend's children which is making me feel very suicidal, among a majority of other things.

Erp is the best way to get through OCD and i've seen amazing help from it but i couldn't keep doing it myself so i wanted to have a professional to help me. What should i do, is it okay to solve this without erp?

From what I know, medication and ERP are the gold standard. Talk therapy is great for other issues but not the most effective for OCD. 

And to say they have an ""experimental treatment"" but won't tell you what it is?

I would find a different therapist. ### You should probably get a new therapist then IMO. ERP is the gold standard for ocd. ### What type of therapy are they proposing instead of ERP? ### This is going to probably sound blunt and terse, but it's because reading this is making me annoyed with your current therapist: you are paying this person to provide a service for you. They are effectively you're employee. If you think ERP would be the best approach for you and they are hesitant to oblige, you need to find someone who will use that in your sessions. If they're a good therapist, they should try to help you find someone who is a better fit for you. Now, don't get me wrong, there is a reason we find professionals to help us through this process, but they don't know everything and they aren't infallible. It's very possible they don't have much experience in treating OCD. My current therapist (who is an OCD specialist) said it herself: every therapist knows about OCD and may have been trained in how to treat it, but being trained and specializing are very different things here. I know it may be a difficult conversation to have (I've been there!), but it sounds to me like you may want to find someone else. 

Side note: I'm not sure of your history with treatment, but it took me over 1 month (1 session per week for a total of 5 or 6 sessions) before I finally performed my first exposure: 1 session for my therapist to get to know me, 2 to get an official diagnosis, 1 for psychoeducation with myself and my parents on what to expect, and 1 or 2 on building a list of exposures to work on, so it takes time to get started. And once you do start your exposures, you may get overzealous and try to do more than what your therapist thinks you're ready for. I've been really gung-ho and mine has had to make me step back to try to slow down. You don't want to go too fast and end up bouncing back to a worse spot. All this to say: don't be surprised if the process goes slow, even after you find someone who will practice ERP with you and you think is a good fit.

Best of luck, OP! ###  OP, based on your comments it sounds like this person doesn‚Äôt understand effective OCD treatment. Please, for your own sake, seek a second opinion. ### They really are! I'm on medication and have been doing ERP by myself and they saved my life! But the problem is i've been having serious stress lately and couldn't manage to do it on my own, so i wanted to give this matter to a professional to help me. They haven't diagnosed me yet but i'm heartbroken to see such money went for almost nothing. I'll talk this with my family, hopefully they'll understand this too. ### I Agree!!! ERP is literally the gold standard for it, i've seen it myself. ### They haven't told a name yet but they told me they were going to do some ''Experimental Things'' other than ERP. ### It was my first time with them and they were trying to understand my situation, diagnose me. I told them i'm having issues with OCD and Pure O but they weren't enthusiastic as me, i understand it that's correct but i was also trying to save them a great time (i know it's not up to me but i really need the time in my hands and the money i'm sacrificing.). I was hoping that they'd agree with me but they're taking it slower than i expected :/ I've seen and learned many things all through my experience and i want someone to guide my way through merging them. Like we could talk about intrusive thoughts etc. but it didn't happen as i expected. I'm also aware this is a good sign, they are taking care of details and backstory but it's very much obvious at this point i'm at. ### I want to find someone else and you're right, not everyone is trained in it. But the thing is i told my exact problem to them, i'm %100 percent sure of it but they didn't try to find me an ocd specialist after this.

I think i'm going too fast in this situation, it was my first session with them and they got to know me. I know i should wait for a diagnosis but when i mentioned a few therapy techniques, they told me weren't going to practice ERP and even told that they don't understand doing it overall. It was suspicious to hear something from them, especially from a therapist. It'd be okay if they told me this because of me not being diagnosed with it yet but hearing the second part was really a red flag.

I agree! I tried ERP myself and doing it so fast to the things you're not ready for, results in a worse backlash! Learning from it, i later took this step by step, from easy to hard and it has been perfect :) But lately, i've been having a huge stress on me due to a very important exam which i'm not slightly ready for because of my ocd interfering with my life, i couldn't keep doing ERP succesfully and thought it'd be the best to get some help. Yesterday really was an exception far away from my imagination. I hope i'll find a nice ocd therapist soon!

Thank you for your kind wishes! I wish the same to you too <3  


Edit: Typo :P ### Also this was the thing i was expecting to hear! ### I will, thanks! ### That really sucks üòû the person I spoke to directed me to this video so maybe it will be helpful to you in finding a new therapist 
[How to find an OCD therapist ](http://How to Find an OCD Therapist https://www.cfcbt.ca/resources?wix-vod-video-id=91132aabb5884a51a95c483e91a7ea08&wix-vod-comp-id=comp-ka7hmgq1) ### Did they give a reason why they don‚Äôt want to do ERP? ### Thank you so much!! They told me they will send a few videos but not about finding another therapist i'm sure. I'll watch it and hopefully find an OCD therapist, people really need to understand what it is otherwise it won't work. 

I tried to click to the link but it's broken, can you try sending it again? Thanks :) ### They said this exact thing; ''I don't understand/find it correct to let patients get exposured to things they are scared, it's like torturing them. We'll be doing things other than that.''

I Don't know, i'm really upset about it. (Forgive me for saying this but) Does she know how wonderful ERP is? It's not a torture, it's a torture for OCD. The one gets all the pain is it, not us! ### Sorry about that! It's the first video on the page.

https://www.cfcbt.ca/resources ### That‚Äôs almost exactly what my first therapist said about exposure therapy. She didn‚Äôt know much about ocd; I was seeing her for other things. One of her specialties was trauma/PTSD, and I can understand that opinion on exposure therapy if coming from a trauma therapy perspective. 

I didn‚Äôt make any progress on ocd with her. I did ERP on my own for a while, and I‚Äôm working with a therapist who knows more about ocd now. The exposures aren‚Äôt fun, but they are effective. ### Thank you again! <3 ### This person is a great and known therapist in my area but i don't know if they know about OCD, and i think they are not used to it. This feels a bit ashaming to say about them but seriously denying ERP in OCD treatment? It seems a bit off to me. ### You're right, they are more likely working on that area of psychology and that's what i'm thinking about their words. They are probably thinking this is some sort of common thing and can be solved like the others. No, it's not. Like another person said, Medication and ERP is the gold standards for it. ### Huh this is an interesting persecuting from a ptsd specialist. I previously had PTSD and was treated using exposure therapy- had to keep reliving the awful moment again and again during therapy. I thought surely this can‚Äôt help?! But it did - I became completely desensitised, memory clicked back into place, symptoms of PTSD massively reduced. Got my life back. 
I‚Äôm now doing exposure therapy for OCD & am cautiously optimistic given that it worked so well for PTSD! ### I would ask how much experience they have working with OCD. I wasted a lot of time and money working with my first therapist trying to treat OCD like other disorders. We did a lot of talk therapy and even some EMDR, which is great for PTSD, but wasn‚Äôt even remotely helpful for OCD. ### I did EMDR for PTSD. My therapist said EMDR was a lot less awful than exposure therapy. It worked really well for reprocessing trauma. It still sucked going through it, but not as much as I imagine exposure therapy would‚Äôve. ### I want to ask them too and probably will. I told them ERP at one point to give some ideas about what i really need and they just rejected it. They also wanted me to write down my dreams (i don't know why did they want it, i didn't tell anything about it) and my journal which i don't want to show. I want to show but after this i really don't want to, they are also a little bit private to me and it'll be annoying for me. ### I can‚Äôt see how logging/discussing your dreams would be helpful for treating ocd. ### I can't understand either, i was surprised when i heard that. I'm just stressed and being pressured under intrusive thoughts, why do you ask me this? I know my dreams are random things and they don't bother me. I also began having nice dreams after going through my recovery progress, i'm enjoying them most of the time. I don't want to pay such a large money for this. ### That sounds like possibly Jungian psychology or some New Age woo. It's very weird that they vaguely said they were going to be doing some experimental things without even explaining what those things are. If it's legit and approved treatment, they should be able to explain up front what it is so you can research and decide if it's something you are OK with doing. It should not be a mystery. If there was a more legit explanation for not doing ERP like safety concerns that for your situation that should be done in a residential setting, that I could understand. But saying that it's torture is BS and bizarre. ### >But saying that it's torture is BS and bizarre.

It really is, i can't understand either. ### ",7,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/teuctl/my_therapist_told_me_that_we_wont_be_doing_erp/
tf0mj0,"Living with OCD - Can ppl with ocd be happy again ? Sry for my bad eng :)

I developed ocd when I was 7 y old  , at the start it was nothing big . I had some rituals that I needed to do but when I finished them I could funcion normaly the rest of the day . As the years passed the ocd got worse . I started to wash my hands for everything ( when I opened the door of my room , when I opened the fridge etc ) . Even thoe that was quite bad I was still happy in my daily life , but this past few months my OCD got out of control , I cant function normaly , I always have something on my mind and I can never relax , It came to the point where I just dont want to get out of my bed cuz I know that It will be hell from there on. If i put my foot on the floor  accidentaly I have to wash my foot , if my shirt falls on the floor I have to wash it again , If i remember that 2 y ago I put something on my desk and did no clean the thing I have to wash my desk , pc , phone , wallet everything that I have ever touched  and that just goes every single day 

I just wanted to ask if somebody had a simmilar situation and if there is hope that some day I can have a normal life ? :",9,2022-03-15 17:18:16-04:00,"15 years, dozens of meds and thousands of hours of therapy and even surgery I'm still miserable so I would say no. ### Now and again.. ### I was exactly like you are right now. Medication helps. I am not gonna say it fixes the problem but it gets a bit better. Still asking myself if I can live with it for the rest of my life but I have hope thinking that with meds, a lot of work and therapy it will get better. ### My first OCD symptoms developed when I was four. I was so mentally thrashed as a kid, and the trouble persisted into my teens. I was always miserable, and most of the time I really believed that not existing would be better than having to deal with my OCD and anxiety. I was in and out of mental hospitals because of my OCD and related issues, and struggled to maintain a normal life for a very long time.  


I graduated with my BS last spring, and I recently received an offer for my dream job (I start next Monday!). I am following a lucrative and fulfilling career path, I have a boyfriend who I love and who loves me, I have a few wonderful friends, and I don't know if I've ever been happier. But my OCD has not gone away. I've just learned how to deal with a lot of my intrusive thoughts and compulsions, and in many ways have integrated them into my everyday life so that I can live alongside my mental struggles rather than be conquered by them. One of the misconceptions about overcoming mental health is that everything disappears completely, but I've learned that it is often not the case. More often, the individual struggling with the symptoms learns to live with them so that they can have a more stable existence.

You can totally be happy someday. Don't rob yourself of the opportunity to be happy and live a full life because of the fear that you'll never get beyond the experiences you're having now. It can absolutely get better. ### Dude i literally have the same issues as you except that somehow i managed to get to the point where i could do rituals in order to move abroad (India) for treatment because the doctors in where i was living (a country called Burundi) were total trash.

As of now i am taking medications which is helping me but its not enough. In my case of OCD i get mainly triggered by minute food particles i.e biscuit/ bread crumbs and also sticky and oily foods. The sticky and oily foods trigger me the most and as of now i cant handle those types of food items.

My fear is not of germs but rather food particles which i worry will be transferred from someone's hand (if they haven't washed their hands yet) to objects/ other people by coming into contact with them. This goes on forever and makes me think that the whole world is full of oily/greasy and sticky food residues.

I also get triggered by dust but its not that much. I know its weird but the thing is that i dont understand myself and why im getting these thoughts. There are certain weird things which dont trigger me i.e blood and powder so at this point i cant understand myself. Its like im in hell. 

Whatever you're going through i literally feel it as if i have entered into your body since your symptoms are so close to mine that its crazy. If u have any questions pls do post it here. I will regularly be checking so that i may be able to help you even though i cant help myself.

Oh yeah btw im not that type of person who likes to sweet talk people and then not reply to their comments. I am among those who will respond to you as quick as i can.

You and me are on the same boat. And if u ever feel like you want to contact me I'll give you my whatsapp number then we can talk on the phone. Just tell me if u need it and ill give it to you.

I am also not that type of person who laughs or ridicules other people's thoughts unlike many people who dont understand OCD.

Feel free to contact me and if i dont respond then u can call me a PIG. Yeah that's right! A selfish PIG!!! ### Do you mind telling me withc medications do you use ? ### Has persuing the career you love helped you in any way in the ocd part ? ### I got fluoxetine prescribed and starting psychological therapy! After a lot of time feeling desperate and lost, now I have a path to follow. 
Really hoping you get better, even if it is just a tiny bit it makes difference ‚ù§Ô∏è ### Oh definitely. It was really scary making the decision to pursue my career, not because I didn't have the passion and love for it, or the capacity to learn, but because my OCD was debilitating for most of my life. I think it also really helped me to accept the OCD as a part of myself rather than to identify myself by my OCD (i.e., I have a mental illness, I'm not a mental illness). Some of my professors ended up also having mental illness. One of my favorite professors had severe anxiety, and I remember having conversations with her about the challenges I had during her office hours. She was one of my greatest supporters, and I think it was so wonderful having her as a role model. She struggled a lot and had to take medication, but she had a PhD in chemistry and was one of the most knowledgeable and passionate professors I've ever had. Seeing that she could accomplish her goals gave me hope for mine as well.  


Pursing a path towards a career in a field that I loved gave me so much power that I didn't feel I had prior. My anxiety and OCD aboslutely did not go away, but I didn't feel so overpowered by them anymore because I was able to demonstrate to myself that I could be a functional and successful individual despite the challenges I faced. ### ",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tf0mj0/living_with_ocd_can_ppl_with_ocd_be_happy_again/

tew15v,"The immense feeling of guilt and shame is killing me (18M) I believe I have had POCD and OCD my whole life and I ignored these feelings until a recent incident. I have had a porn addiction since I was 8 and I think this is where all my issues started. I have always discussed paedophilia and how messed up it is but recently I'm terrified I have become one. About 2 weeks ago I saw a Japanese teen porn gif and she looked quite young and I searched for it to make sure I didn't just see CP but it was a legal video on xvideos, when viewed it, it didn't look as bad as I had thought and was reassured as it was on xvideos. I masturbated to it and it felt better than usual as she looked younger and could be someone my age and looked similar to an Asian girl in my class, its more taboo as I don't usually watch ""petit"" videos. I finished up not thinking anything of it, but I had a usual OCD POCD thought but thought back to the video and became extremely disgusted with myself at what I had done that as she looked young, she could be mistaken for younger depending on which part of the video. I've watched some fucked up porn and I'm only realising now how abnormal this all is and how I feel like a fucking monster. The actress is older than me but she looks young and I am fucking freaking out. I can't tell anyone or else I may be misunderstood. If it wasn't for this video I could easily deal with my POCD thoughts but I am worried that this is confirming it. I masturbated to the video assuming she was an adult as she is (she is 25) but I wish I never masturbated to it as it has given me these awful thoughts. Please someone help me I don't know what to think, I can't focus on my life I fucking hate this.",2,2022-03-15 14:23:48-04:00,"Look how anxious and awful you feel. Someone who is like this and likes it doesn't feel this at all. They enjoy it. You're getting anxious and fearful about it all - what does it mean about me? What if this? What if that? Checking, then rechecking, ruminating. Someone who is 'messed up' doesn't do any of this. They don't see anything wrong at all. They definitely don't get anxiety thinking about their actions. 

Everyone makes mistakes (you mentioned about it all being 'effed up'). But the fact you feel so bad/anxious about it shows it's not the real you. You did something that doesn't align with who you are, you're thinking things that don't align with who you are, so you feel completely broken. If it aligned with you as a person you would feel natural, comfortable, etc. I don't know you personally but it all sounds like OCD.

texa57,Just started Luvox Has been absolutely life changing so far! Things I didn‚Äôt even know where wrong with me have gone away and I wake up excited to be alive. However I had a couple of bad days which is to be excepted every once in a while. However by the third day I was riddled with paranoia and worry that my medicine had stopped working completely I had to go to bed early. I was obsessing over Luvox reactions on Reddit and looking up side effects and articles on the medicine. Woke up the next day feeling how i usually feel on it. Very thankful for this but it‚Äôs interesting to see how my bad days are now. The past few days are usually what good day were like before I had the meds. Extremely thankful for this medicine and I hope it keeps working for me forever lol!,4,2022-03-15 15:12:40-04:00,How did you feel on Luvox when you first started? I quit after two doses because I was having extreme anxiety on it. Literally thought I was dying. ### I absolutely love it! I feel extremely calm and present there are no voices in my head or weird thought loops I can‚Äôt get out of. I am much more In control of my thoughts now because of this. The only quirk I‚Äôve experienced is sever fatigue and a complete lack of motivation to do things. That is only some days and hopefully the side effect won‚Äôt last long. Since it‚Äôs an SSRI you shouldn‚Äôt feel anything until two weeks since it‚Äôs a medicine that builds. I would def recommend trying it again bc maybe it was your brain knowing you had taken medication and was reacting to that knowledge and not the actual medicinal effects bc agin it takes at least two weeks to feel anything with SSRI‚Äôs ### How long have you been taking it?

tezr07,"Anxiety not reducing with ERP. Help Needed I have real event ocd, so i'm doing scripts 30 mins a day as part of my ERP. I've found that even after 30 minutes my anxiety has not reduced. Shall i keep doing it for 30 mins a day and naturally my anxiety will eventually decrease, or do i need to do it longer as it's not decreasing currently with 30 mins?",13,2022-03-15 16:39:29-04:00,"[deleted] ### If you have time I would recommend doing it longer until your anxiety at least reduces by a little bit so your brain realizes you aren‚Äôt in danger. It‚Äôs also important not to promise you can do a compulsion right after ERP is over. ### It's been my understanding that ERP is not about reducing anxiety, but about practice stopping the compulsions even if you feel anxious. ERP usually heightens my anxiety somewhat, but then overtime my brain gets bored of the script. It's possible you're using your scripts as a method of trying to relieve anxiety, which could be another compulsion. It might be helpful to get a therapist's perspective on this. ### Standard not a therapist disclaimer. Let me ask you, are you still ruminating once you‚Äôre done with the scripting?

Edit: to add, I know very well that themes main compulsion is rumination and I‚Äôve found if I don‚Äôt stop ruminating the anxiety doesn‚Äôt leave. ### I‚Äôm definitely not a therapist though I‚Äôve seen my share‚Ä¶I‚Äôve always been told to stay with the exposure until my anxiety started to go down.  If you aren‚Äôt working with a therapist, it would help at least get you some guidelines. ### It's quite frustrating,  because everywhere I've read or videos I've viewed have said about the anxiety reducing and then to stop, but my anxiety simply doesn't reduce during it.

The script I'm doing is actually an imaginal one. I found listening to a recording, or reading a script didn't seem to do anything to my anxiety. Instead I lay  in bed -no nice blanket, nothing comforting etc- and then start to think the worse possible scenario to ever happen. It gets my anxiety going pretty quickly. ### During the script I'm definitely not doing any complusiobs to keep the ocd going. I'm fully in the erp and letting the anxiety just be there. I just thought that after 30 minutes my anxiety would reduce, but it's still the same. I'm unsure if I should maybe increase it to 45 minutes, or just keep at the 30 minutes and maybe over a week or two I'll habituate to it. I've only done this script for a few days ### Honestly, I ruminate every second of the day. Its natural for me to think thw same thing over ans over again every 5 seconds. If I stop myself I'll start ruminating once again. I've ruminated over the same thing for so long, I don't even know what to think about anymore ### [deleted] ### Gotcha. Probably still a good question to ask a specialist.    Maybe you don't need to take any action at all. Maybe this is more of a wait and see and try to sit with the anxiety as much as you can. I know that's easier said than done. I'm sorry you are dealing with this anxiety, I know it can be really uncomfortable. ### Yeah that‚Äôs the key. Rumination is the final video game boss of OCD. It‚Äôs not something that you can conquer overnight, but def worth working on it. Dr. Greenberg has great resources in working on combating it. ### I've only been doing this specific exposure for a few days, so maybe that's why it's not had any affect and no anxiety reduction to it ### Have you ever tried to combat? I honestly start ruminating every 5 seconds, it's insane. ### Oh yeah, I spent a good year working only on rumination. I have bad days here and there but am mostly past it. Greenberg work was the key for me. ### I shall give you a message! ### ",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/tezr07/anxiety_not_reducing_with_erp_help_needed/
